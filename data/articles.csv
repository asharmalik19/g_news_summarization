iPhones Could Get a 200MP Camera Soon; Apple’s 3-Year Redesign Plan Leaks,"Usama Rasool May 29, 2025

Apple has a long-standing tradition of holding off on new technology until it has matured enough to be used reliably. Such is the case with Samsung’s ISOCELL 200MP sensor, which was first introduced in 2023. It appears that this high-res sensor has reached the level of refinement Apple usually prefers, and the company has finally started entertaining the idea of a 200MP camera on an iPhone.





This exclusive news came from Digital Chat Station’s Weibo profile, claiming that Apple may have started testing 200 million pixels on one of its devices. No specifics were given in the leak as to what camera this new outsole will replace on the iPhone, but this information is still curious for millions of fans.

iPhone Rate List in Pakistan 2025

Traditionally, when we hear a 200MP sensor on an Android phone, it’s usually positioned as a high-end primary camera or the periscope telephoto in one of the newer flagship phones. Samsung has been using the 200MP sensor under the Main lens on its “Ultra” phones for years.





Then, we have devices like the Vivo X200 Ultra and Xiaomi 15 Ultra that utilize the 200MP sensor for periscope telephoto cameras. But, this type of combination is sparingly used for being too expensive. The safest bet will be to assume a 200MP “primary” camera awaiting the iPhone, as interest grows not only in camera specs but also in the evolving iPhone rate list.

DCS posted another interesting leak on Weibo, hinting at the most prominent changes Apple intends to make on the iPhones in the next three lineups. In 2025, the camera design should change from square to horizontal bar, likely to make room for the 48MP ultrawide lens.

Moving on to 2026, we’ll see the Face ID hidden under a screen, leaving a single punch-hole cutout for the selfie camera. So far, this claim has only met with skepticism, but it can’t be dismissed entirely until we hear otherwise from credible sources. If true, this innovation could debut with the iPhone 17 or 18 series, offering a cleaner, more seamless front display.

The leaker foreshadows that the iPhone 19 series will have the Face ID and the front camera completely hidden behind the screen with no punch-hole or pilled cutout.

Concerns Over Pricing and Performance of A Series

Conversely, some users express reservations about the A series’ value proposition. Critics argue that the series is overpriced, offering lower specifications compared to similarly priced alternatives from brands like Xiaomi and OnePlus.







Issues such as laggy performance, especially in lower-end models, and subpar camera quality have been highlighted. Some users also report hardware issues developing over time, suggesting potential planned obsolescence.

Global Reviews Reflect Similar Sentiments

International reviews mirror these mixed sentiments. The Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is globally praised for its sleek design and vibrant display, offering a reliable mid-range option. However, some reviews point out areas for improvement, such as the display’s brightness and camera performance in low-light conditions.

Another candidate is the Galaxy A56 5G. It has been noted for bridging the gap between mid-range and premium smartphones, offering features like a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, improved brightness, and a refined camera design. However, in Pakistani market, it can easily cross the PKR 130,000 mark, making it questionable purchase for those on a budget.

Google: China-backed hackers hiding malware in calendar events,"Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Dive Brief:

In October, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group spotted Chinese government hackers from APT41 deploying malware that abused Google Calendar to steal data and execute operations on compromised devices.

The malware embedded stolen data in calendar events, and the attackers used other calendar events to deploy instructions to the hacked computers.

Google’s new findings underscore how elite cyber threat groups are getting more creative and how even highly secure cloud platforms are not impervious to these malicious operations.

Dive Insight:

Google discovered a malware variant it dubbed “ToughProgress” that uses Google Calendar as a command-and-control (C2) server, a novel way of establishing a communications link between APT41’s infrastructure and compromised devices that is both reliable and innocuous.

“Once executed, TOUGHPROGRESS creates a zero minute Calendar event at a hardcoded date, 2023-05-30, with data collected from the compromised host being encrypted and written in the Calendar event description,” Google researchers wrote.

“The operator places encrypted commands in Calendar events on 2023-07-30 and 2023-07-31, which are predetermined dates also hardcoded into the malware,” the researchers explained. “TOUGHPROGRESS then begins polling Calendar for these events. When an event is retrieved, the event description is decrypted and the command it contains is executed on the compromised host. Results from the command execution are encrypted and written back to another Calendar event.”

ToughProgress isn’t the first malware strain to exploit cloud services for C2 infrastructure. “Misuse of cloud services for C2 is a technique that many threat actors leverage in order to blend in with legitimate activity,” Google researchers wrote, pointing to similar episodes involving Microsoft, Dropbox and even Instagram.

The continued abuse of legitimate, high-profile cloud services presents a major challenge for security teams, which must monitor not only for suspicious connections (such as visits to malicious websites) but also nefarious activity occurring over legitimate connections.

The Chinese state-backed group APT41 is one of Beijing’s premier hacking teams. The group has used free services to host their payloads since at least last August, according to Google researchers, who observed the group sending links to these payloads “to hundreds of targets in a variety of geographic locations and industries.” APT41 is particularly fond of Cloudflare Worker web domains, according to the researchers.",https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/china-hackers-google-calendar-events-research/749290/,Technology

WhatsApp tests new username feature to enhance user privacy,"The world’s most popular messaging app, WhatsApp, is testing a new feature that could mark a significant step forward in user privacy. Soon, users will be able to connect with others without revealing their phone numbers—thanks to a new username-based system.

According to reports, WhatsApp is working on a feature that will allow each user to choose a unique username, composed of letters and numbers. This username will serve as a new way to initiate chats, eliminating the need to share personal phone numbers.

This feature is expected to be particularly useful for those who wish to maintain privacy in short-term interactions, business communications, or while connecting with strangers. Users will no longer need to save phone numbers or compromise on privacy to start a conversation.

Interestingly, the username will not only act as a means to contact someone but will also allow users to search for others using their chosen names. This could make messaging on WhatsApp simpler, more secure, and more modern than ever before.

Currently, the feature is in its testing phase and not yet available to the general public. However, it may soon be rolled out in upcoming updates to the mobile app.

According to WABetaInfo, a trusted source for WhatsApp-related updates, this new username functionality has the potential to bring a “positive revolution” in digital privacy.

Experts believed that WhatsApp’s latest move would not only meet modern privacy demands but also boost user confidence in the platform.

In an era where protecting personal information is more important than ever, WhatsApp’s initiative is being welcomed as a significant and timely advancement.",https://pakobserver.net/whatsapp-tests-new-username-feature-to-enhance-user-privacy/,Technology
NVIDIA's native GeForce NOW app is now available for Steam Deck,"The Steam Deck just got even more useful. NVIDIA's native GeForce NOW app is now available for the portable console , after being teased back at CES . This allows Steam Deck owners to stream the entire library of over 2,200 games, with up to a 4K resolution at 60FPS.

There are some benefits to using this service even when the game already runs natively on the Steam Deck. The integration provides HDR, DLSS 4 and Reflex on supported titles and the settings can be pushed much higher than usual. This is a streaming platform, so the Steam Deck is more or less just a display for cloud content.

To that end, NVIDIA promises a massive increase in battery life when using GeForce NOW as compared to running a game natively on the console. The company says players could squeeze around 50 percent more use out of the Steam Deck before requiring a charge. This is a big deal, as the Deck is a noted battery hog .

It also allows players to run games that aren't available on the handheld. GeForce NOW pulls its library from Steam, Epic Games Store, Game Pass for PC, Ubisoft, Blizzard's Battle.net and other places. NVIDIA says that it can be used to run games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Monster Hunter Wilds and Microsoft Flight Sim 2024 ""at max settings without worrying about hardware limits."" That's an enticing proposition.

The Steam Deck is also easily docked to a TV, offering a way to play the aforementioned titles on the big screen. There's a free version of GeForce NOW to try it out, but it comes with serious caveats. The queues are generally much longer here than with paid subscriptions and users are limited to play sessions of one hour. The company's offering a six-month Performance membership right now for $30 . This reverts back to $50 once the period expires.

Mistral launches new code embedding model that outperforms OpenAI and Cohere in real-world retrieval tasks,"Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More

With demand for enterprise retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on the rise, the opportunity is ripe for model providers to offer their take on embedding models.

French AI company Mistral threw its hat into the ring with Codestral Embed, its first embedding model, which it said outperforms existing embedding models on benchmarks like SWE-Bench.

The model specializes in code and “performs especially well for retrieval use cases on real-world code data.” The model is available to developers for $0.15 per million tokens.

The company said the Codestral Embed “significantly outperforms leading code embedders” like Voyage Code 3, Cohere Embed v4.0 and OpenAI’s embedding model, Text Embedding 3 Large.

Super excited to announce @MistralAI Codestral Embed, our first embedding model specialized for code.

Codestral Embed, part of Mistral’s Codestral family of coding models, can make embeddings that transform code and data into numerical representations for RAG.

“Codestral Embed can output embeddings with different dimensions and precisions, and the figure below illustrates the trade-offs between retrieval quality and storage costs,” Mistral said in a blog post. “Codestral Embed with dimension 256 and int8 precision still performs better than any model from our competitors. The dimensions of our embeddings are ordered by relevance. For any integer target dimension n, you can choose to keep the first n dimensions for a smooth trade-off between quality and cost.”

Mistral tested the model on several benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text2Code from GitHub. In both cases, the company said Codestral Embed outperformed leading embedding models.

Mistral said Codestral Embed is optimized for “high-performance code retrieval” and semantic understanding. The company said the code works best for at least four kinds of use cases: RAG, semantic code search, similarity search and code analytics.

Embedding models generally target RAG use cases, as they can facilitate faster information retrieval for tasks or agentic processes. Therefore, it’s not surprising that Codestral Embed would focus on that.

The model can also perform semantic code search, allowing developers to find code snippets using natural language. This use case works well for developer tool platforms, documentation systems and coding copilots. Codestral Embed can also help developers identify duplicated code segments or similar code strings, which can be helpful for enterprises with policies regarding reused code.

The model supports semantic clustering, which involves grouping code based on its functionality or structure. This use case would help analyze repositories, categorize and find patterns in code architecture.

Competition is increasing in the embedding space

Mistral has been on a roll with releasing new models and agentic tools. It released Mistral Medium 3, a medium version of its flagship large language model (LLM), which currently powers its enterprise-focused platform Le Chat Enterprise.

It also announced the Agents API, which allows developers to access tools for creating agents that perform real-world tasks and orchestrate multiple agents.

Mistral’s moves to offer more model options to developers have not gone unnoticed in developer spaces. Some on X note that Mistral’s timing in releasing Codestral Embed is “coming on the heels of increased competition.”

South Korean Scientists Use Game Code to Boost Fusion Energy,"A novel advancement in the field of nuclear fusion energy research has been made possible by an unlikely source: video game technology. In order to enhance the efficacy of nuclear fusion reactors, scientists at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in South Korea have modified collision detection algorithms. It is important to note here that these algorithms are typically employed in video games to simulate realistic interactions between objects.







About the Fusion Energy Innovation

This innovation has led to a 15-fold increase in the speed of predicting particle collisions within fusion reactions. It marks a significant step toward making fusion energy more viable and cost-effective for real-world applications.

Collision detection algorithms are foundational in the gaming world. They allow virtual environments to simulate how characters and objects move, interact, and react when they collide. In this context, these same algorithms are helping researchers accurately model where and when high-energy particles are likely to crash into each other or into the reactor walls.

Accurate collision prediction is vital in fusion energy production. Unintended impacts with the reactor walls can disrupt the delicate balance needed to sustain fusion reactions. With the enhanced precision offered by these game-based algorithms, scientists can better control the fusion process, resulting in more stable and sustainable energy output.







Fusion Energy’s Future May Lie in Play

Nuclear fusion, the reaction that powers the sun, involves fusing hydrogen atoms under extreme heat and pressure to release immense energy. Unlike nuclear fission, fusion doesn’t produce long-lived radioactive waste and offers the potential for an abundant, clean energy source.

However, attaining the conditions required for stable fusion has been a tough scientific problem for decades. That’s why this multidisciplinary leap, borrowing from the game industry, is so crucial.

This fusion of science and gaming underscores the power of cross-industry collaboration in tackling global challenges. As nations push to transition toward renewable energy, innovations like this could play a crucial role in reshaping how we power the planet.",https://www.techjuice.pk/south-korean-scientists-use-game-code-to-boost-fusion-energy/,Technology

Xiaomi Just Took Aim at Apple and Tesla -- And It's Not Backing,"Xiaomi (XIACY, Financial) just fired a shot at two of the world's most valuable companies — and it wasn't subtle. At a splashy product launch in China, CEO Lei Jun unveiled the 15S Pro smartphone, priced at just 5,499 yuan ($764), making it eligible for a government subsidy. That's well below the iPhone 16 Pro's 7,999 yuan starting point — a critical price edge in a country where the 6,000 yuan threshold unlocks discounts for consumers. More importantly, Lei claimed Xiaomi's homegrown chip, the Xring O1, beats Apple's (AAPL, Financial) A18 Pro in key areas like thermal performance during gaming. It took four years and $1.87 billion to develop — and it's already in mass production using the same 3nm process that powers Apple's flagship.

But phones are just the warm-up act. Xiaomi's real ambition might be on four wheels. After undercutting Tesla (TSLA, Financial) last year with its SU7 sedan — priced $4,000 lower than the Model 3 — the company is now preparing to launch the YU7 SUV in July. Lei didn't reveal pricing, but he did drop a few details: the YU7 will feature chips from Qualcomm and Nvidia, advanced driver assist, and up to 835 km of range. Still, the road hasn't been smooth. A fatal SU7 crash triggered tighter ad rules on driver-assist features. Despite that, Xiaomi delivered 28,000 vehicles in April and shows no signs of slowing down.

Investors will get their next read on May 27, when Xiaomi reports Q1 results. Last year, it posted record revenue and profit, with nearly 42% of sales coming from overseas markets. The stock is already up over 50% year-to-date — and with Lei pledging 200 billion yuan in R&D through 2031, the market may be starting to realize: this isn't just a phone company anymore. Xiaomi wants to play in every arena Apple and Tesla dominate — and it's bringing its own chips, cars, and pricing power to the fight.",https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2889911/xiaomi-just-took-aim-at-apple-and-tesla-and-its-not-backing-down,Technology
Exclusive: Here are some more images showing the Infinix Hot 60 Pro+'s sub-6mm design,"Infinix is expected to launch the Hot 60 Pro+ with a sub-6mm design soon. Last week, we saw some images comparing its slim design to a regular iPhone, and yesterday, we saw a video comparing the Hot 60 Pro+'s thickness and weight to those of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Today, we've got some exclusive images corroborating previous leaks, with two of them showing the Infinix Hot 60 Pro+ being as thick as four credit cards and three coins.



Infinix Hot 60 Pro+

The Infinix Hot 60 Pro+ will be 5.95mm thick, which could make it the world's thinnest curved display phone at launch. Yesterday's video revealed that while the Hot 60 Pro+ is 0.2mm thicker than the Galaxy S25 Edge, it surprisingly weighs less: 154.6g vs. 163.8g.



Infinix Hot 60 Pro+ with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge

That makes us wonder about the battery capacity of the Infinix Hot 60 Pro+. While there's no word from Infinix about that, a reliable source told us the Hot 60 Pro+ will ""pack a massive battery."" It remains to be seen how massive the battery will be.

Return to the lab

""We are likely facing a very tough budget environment — this is a time to have all hands on deck and to do everything we can to ensure the best possible future for the Lab,"" JPL said in an email to colleagues.

""We weighed this decision carefully. As we return, we will focus on cultivating relationship-building, mentoring, spontaneous interactions, and real-time problem-solving — all of which drive our most innovative work and will prepare us to meet the demands of today’s dynamic environment.""

The email sent to JPL employees also laid out the timeframe for the full return to the office, stating that those who don't return to full-time office work will lose their jobs.

""General telework employees will have until Monday, August 25 (2025), to fully return to their assigned work location, and remote telework employees — both in and outside of California — will have until Monday, October 27.

""Note that for those who can, we encourage returning to fully onsite work sooner than the required dates. Although rare exceptions are possible, employees who do not return by their required date will be considered to have resigned.""

The email said that exceptions to fully-onsite work may be made, but that they will be ""extremely rare"".

"NASA Langley Uses Height, Gravity to Test Long, Flexible Booms","Researchers look at a bend that occurred in the 94-foot triangular, rollable and collapsible boom during an off-axis compression test. NASA/David C. Bowman

Researchers at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, have developed a technique to test long, flexible, composite booms for use in space in such a way that gravity helps, rather than hinders, the process. During a recent test campaign inside a 100-foot tower at a NASA Langley lab, researchers suspended a 94-foot triangular, rollable, and collapsible boom manufactured by Florida-based aerospace company, Redwire, and applied different forces to the boom to see how it would respond.

Having a facility tall enough to accommodate vertical testing is advantageous because horizontal tests require extra equipment to keep gravity from bending the long booms, but this extra equipment in turn affects how the boom responds. These mechanical tests are important because NASA and commercial space partners could use long composite booms for several functions including deployable solar sails and deployable structures, such as towers for solar panels, that could support humans living and working on the Moon.

Redwire will be able to compare the results of the physical testing at NASA Langley to their own numerical models and get a better understanding of their hardware. NASA’s Game Changing Development program in the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate funded the tests.",https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/langley/nasa-langley-uses-height-gravity-to-test-long-flexible-booms/,Technology
Gemini can now watch Google Drive videos for you,"Google’s latest Drive features can give Workspace users more information about the videos they’ve saved. A Gemini AI feature that summarizes documents and PDFs in Google Drive is now expanding to video files, allowing users to gain insights about what’s in the video without having to watch it themselves.

The Gemini in Drive feature provides a familiar chatbot interface that can provide quick summaries describing the footage or pull specific information. For example, users can ask Gemini to list action items mentioned in recorded meetings or highlight the biggest updates and new products in an announcement video, saving time spent on manually combing through and taking notes.

The feature requires captions to be enabled for videos, and can be accessed using either Google Drive’s overlay previewer or a new browser tab window. It’s available in English for Google Workspace and Google One AI Premium users, and anyone who has previously purchased Gemini Business or Enterprise add-ons, though it may take a few weeks to fully roll out.

This could be handy for when you need to find something specific in lengthy meeting recordings. Image: Google

Nintendo’s updated mobile app will make sharing Switch 2 screenshots a lot easier,"Nintendo is gearing up for the launch of the Switch 2 on June 5, and to ensure you’re ready to go when the console arrives at your door, you’ll need to download the latest update for the newly renamed Nintendo Switch App. The app, which was previously called the Nintendo Switch Online app, had added a number of new features, including a more seamless screenshot interface, GameChat functionality and placeholder icons for game-specific services like Zelda Notes. The latter will become usable on launch day.

Arguably the most useful addition is the revamped screenshots and video upload feature, which allows you to link your phone to your Switch 2 and wirelessly upload in-game media to the app, either manually or automatically. This was already possible on the original Switch (and is hardly a revolutionary feature), but doing so involved some needlessly clunky QR code scanning that didn’t always work. Now, screenshots and gameplay clips should just appear in the app, where you can save them locally. Up to 100 files can be stored in the app for 30 days from the point of upload, and once you hit the limit the oldest files will disappear if not saved.

Another big Switch 2 feature is GameChat, Nintendo’s new multiplayer voice chat functionality. Via the Nintendo Switch App you’ll be able to receive notifications for GameChat invites, friends coming online and friend requests. Your added friends will be displayed on the home screen of the app. Again, no one who’s been playing games on a modern PlayStation or Xbox console for the last decade is going to be blown away by any of this stuff, but it looks like playing online with friends on Switch 2 is going to be mercifully less fiddly than on its predecessor.

"‘E-tattoo’ could track mental workload for people in high-stake jobs, study says","Whether it is doing sums or working out what to text your new date, some tasks produce a furrowed brow. Now scientists say they have come up with a device to monitor such effort: an electronic tattoo, stuck to the forehead.

The researchers say the device could prove valuable among pilots, healthcare workers and other professions where managing mental workload is crucial to preventing catastrophes.

“For this kind of high-demand and high-stake scenario, eventually we hope to have this real-time mental workload decoder that can give people some warning and alert so that they can self-adjust, or they can ask AI or a co-worker to offload some of their work,” said Dr Nanshu Lu, an author of the research from the University of Texas at Austin, adding the device may not only help workers avoid serious mistakes but also protect their health.

Writing in the journal Device, Lu and colleagues describe how using questionnaires to investigate mental workload is problematic, not least as people are poor at objectively judging cognitive effort and they are usually conducted after a task.

Meanwhile, existing electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) devices, that can be used to assess mental workload by measuring brain waves and eye movements respectively, are wired, bulky and prone to erroneous measurements arising from movements.

By contrast, the “e-tattoo” is a lightweight, flexible, wireless device.

The black, wiggly path of the e-tattoo is composed of a graphite-based conductive material, and is attached to the forehead using conductive adhesive film.

Four square EEG electrodes, positioned on the forehead, each detect a different region of brain activity – with a reference electrode behind the ear – while rectangular EOG electrodes, placed vertically and horizontally around the eyes, provide data about eye movements. Each of the stretchable electrodes is coated in an additional conductive material.

The e-tattoo, which is bespoke and disposable, is connected to a reusable flexible printed circuit using conductive tape, while a lightweight battery can be clipped to the device.

After finding the e-tattoo worked as well as traditional EEG and EOG devices for monitoring brain waves and eye movements the team tested the technology on six participants.

Each participant was shown a screen on which 20 letters flashed up, one at a time, at various locations. Participants were asked to click a mouse if either the letter itself, or its location, matched one shown a given number of letters (N) back. Each participant carried out the task multiple times, with the N value varying between 0 and 3 – corresponding to four levels of difficulty.

The team found that as the task became harder, the different types of brainwave detected showed shifts in activity that corresponded to a greater mental workload.

The team then fed the EEG and EOG data, together with the “N” numbers, into a machine-learning algorithm. After a training period, the researchers found the algorithm did better than chance at predicting the mental workload of a participant based on their EEG and EOG data alone.

Lu said the full device –including chip and battery – was expected to cost less than $200 (£148). The team are now developing the approach so signals can be decoded by the device’s microprocessor and sent to an app to alert the user if their mental workload is too high.

But the remedy is not, necessarily, to switch to a simple task.

“Previous studies indicated that the optimal mental performance occurs when the mental workload demand is not too low or too high,” said Lu. “When it’s too low, it’s very boring, and the people will just lose focus.”",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/29/e-tattoo-could-track-mental-workload-people-high-stake-jobs-study-says,Technology
Earthquake simulator to test 10-story steel-framed building,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

A 10-story cold-formed steel-framed building will soon be put to the test on an earthquake simulator at the University of California San Diego to see how well it can withstand earthquakes.

The UC San Diego shake table is the only outdoor facility of its kind in the world, and the only simulator capable of testing a building of this height.

Current building codes in the United States only allow for six-story buildings when cold-formed steel is the chosen structural system. The results of this test will help determine if that height limit can safely be increased. Researchers are planning to run the tests in June 2025.

The building is already constructed and is sitting on UC San Diego's outdoor shake table. Researchers will turn the shake table on and recreate earthquake motions recorded during prior earthquakes, including recordings from the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake which struck Los Angeles in 1994 and the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake which struck Northern California in 1989.

This outdoor earthquake simulator at UC San Diego can shake structures weighing up to 2,000 metric tons, or 4.5 million pounds—roughly the weight of 1,300 sedan-sized cars. This makes the earthquake simulator capable of carrying the heaviest test structures in the world.

The shake table can also accelerate to at least 1g—the amount of gravity we experience on Earth when we fall. These motions can in turn accelerate the top of a 10-story building to as much as 3g. For reference, on average, riders on modern roller coasters experience 4g of peak acceleration. Because the shake table is outdoors, it is able to evaluate tall buildings that could not be tested elsewhere.

""We are able to test new ideas and push the boundaries of what we're doing in structural design and construction,"" said Tara Hutchinson, a professor in the UC San Diego Department of Structural Engineering and one of the project's principal investigators.

""Cold-formed steel is a great example of a promising light-weight, sustainable, and highly durable material, ideal for use in regions of high seismic hazard and for construction of tall buildings.""

The shake table is part of NSF's Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure network, or NHERI—eight experimental facilities supporting innovative research for mitigating damage caused by hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, wind storms, storm surge and flooding.

Cold-formed steel-framed building

The 10-story building's skeleton is made from cold-formed sheets of construction-grade steel that are then shaped at room temperature to make individual structural components—studs and floor joists, for example. These are then fastened together to form walls and floors.

Cold-formed steel is easy to manufacture, strong, light and made from recycled steel. The material has become more popular as a substitute for lumber in the past four decades, partially because it can be shaped into components similar to those used in lumber construction, such as two by fours. It also doesn't burn when exposed to fire.

Currently, building codes in the United States only allow cold-formed steel-framed buildings up to 65 feet (20 meters), or about six stories tall. The research team from UC San Diego and Johns Hopkins University is evaluating how taller cold-formed steel-framed buildings, up to 100 feet (30 meters) or 10 stories, would fare during an earthquake.

""Through years of work, we've developed an understanding of how to model key components of new cold formed steel framing systems. We've used models and smaller-scale testing to determine if these systems can perform well in earthquakes, giving us confidence in our new solutions,"" said Ben Schafer, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and the project's other lead principal investigator.

""Overall, if we can predict the precise performance of a new building system, we can share those predictions with engineers to improve building design and construction practices in the U.S.""

The building that will be tested in June is already constructed and sitting on the shake table. It was built using a variety of methods. The first level of the building is ""stick-framed,"" meaning it is assembled on-site with individual components—cold-formed steel track and studs in this case.

Other floors are constructed of wall and floor panels: elements that have been pre-fabricated in a shop and shipped to the site. This project also explores how these panels can be put together into modules, similar to portable trailers, manufactured off site. These modules, very much like stacked Legos, are then assembled on site and lifted onto the building with a crane.

""These tests provide us a unique opportunity to document and compare the resilience of each construction method during an earthquake,"" Hutchinson said.

Non-structural systems, fire tests and sensors

The building also includes what researchers call ""non-structural"" components, such as stairs, roof-top mechanical equipment and pressurized gas and fire sprinkler systems. The researchers will monitor the movement and accelerations in these elements to evaluate if the building would remain functional after a quake.

After the earthquake testing is over and all data has been gathered, the building will be put through a series of live fire tests to study how these components and the structure itself fare in a fire after an earthquake.

Researchers will gather data from earthquake and fire tests with thousands of sensors measuring everything from how much the building moves during a shake to the temperature distribution during fire tests.

""When we perform these large scale tests, it is important we capture response with high fidelity; in this case, we are using thousands of sensors, digital and analog, distributed throughout and around the building,"" said Hutchinson. ""That's real data that allows us to explore and help improve design and construction methods, all of which will improve building codes.""",https://techxplore.com/news/2025-05-earthquake-simulator-story-steel.html,Technology
Self-stirring nanoreactors enhance reaction efficiency for chemical synthesis,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Route 2: the nanodroplet swelling coupled with the stepwise functional co-assembly strategy for the multifunctional architectures. NPs, functional components (nanocrystal or nanoparticle). Credit: Ma et al. (Nature Nanotechnology, 2025).

Recent technological advances have opened new possibilities for the efficient and sustainable synthesis of various valuable chemicals. Some of these advances rely on nanotechnologies, systems or techniques designed to design and study materials or devices at the nanometer scale.

Nanoreactors are nanotechnologies designed to host and control chemical reactions within confined spaces. These small structures serve as tiny ""reaction vessels"" that enable the precise manipulation of the reactants, catalysts and conditions to elicit desired chemical reactions.

Researchers at Inner Mongolia University, Fudan University and Julin University in China recently developed a new paddle-like mesoporous silica nanoreactor that can stir itself when exposed to a rotating magnetic field. This nanoreactor, outlined in a paper published in Nature Nanotechnology, can mix chemicals at a molecular level, enhancing the efficiency of reactions and thus potentially enhancing the synthesis of various compounds.

""Developing artificial nanomaterial systems that can convert external stimuli to achieve nanoscale self-sustainable motion (for example, self-rotation), and simultaneously integrate and deploy the spatial localization of multiple active sites to unravel the intraparticle diffusion patterns of molecules, is of great importance for green synthetic chemistry,"" wrote Yuzhu Ma, Peiting Guo and their colleagues in their paper.

""We show a paddle-like self-stirring mesoporous silica nanoreactor system with separated chambers and controllable proximity of active sites.""

The new nanoreactor developed by Ma, Guo and their collaborators is essentially a tiny, sponge-like structure with pores through which molecules can pass through. Notably, when a rotating magnetic field is applied to it, this sponge-like structure can autonomously rotate itself, producing a stirring motion that mixes chemicals at a molecular level.

The team's nanoreactor incorporates magnetic iron oxide (Fe₃O₄) particles that initiate its rotation, as well as gold (Au) and palladium (Pd) nanocrystals separated in different chambers. This characteristic design facilitates the mixing of catalysts at a nanoscale level, paving the way for the more precise control and enhancement of chemical reactions required to produce specific compounds.

""The nanoreactors are designed by encapsulating magnetic Fe 3 O 4 (~20 nm) in the first chamber, and meantime, Au and Pd nanocrystals are spatially isolated in different domains,"" explained Ma, Guo and their colleagues.

""Such a nanoreactor generates nanoscale rotation under the rotating magnetic fields and exhibits an order of magnitude activity enhancement in the cascade synthesis of 5,6-dimethylphenanthridinium (96.4% selectivity) compared with conventional macro-stirring. We quantitatively uncovered the rotation-induced enhancement in sequential and reverse transfer of reactive intermediates, consequently revealing the relevance of self-rotation and proximity effects in controlling the catalytic performance.""

As part of their study, Ma, Guo and their colleagues used their paddle-like nanoreactor to synthesize the organic compound 5,6-dimethylphenanthridinium, which is widely used to create industrial materials, as well as in the medical and pharmaceutical industries.

The researchers were able to synthesize this compound with a remarkable selectivity of 96.4%, which is significantly higher than the selectivity yielded by conventional macro-stirring techniques.

In the future, the newly introduced nanoreactor could be improved further and applied to the synthesis of other compounds. Moreover, its underlying design could soon inspire the development of similar nanotechnologies that could enhance the efficiency and sustainability of chemical manufacturing or synthesis processes.

Presenting these exquisite Phantoms and original artworks created by our designers in tribute to the nameplate in its centenary year is a fitting celebration of our pinnacle motor car.”

Chris Brownridge, Chief Executive, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars celebrated the 100th anniversary of Phantom, the marque’s most famous nameplate, at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este, Italy, on 24 May 2025.

Rolls-Royce chose this exclusive gathering for the worldwide public debut of Phantom Goldfinger, presented on the Grand Hotel’s renowned Mosaic Lawn on the shore of Lake Como. The striking one-of-one Phantom Extended pays homage to the 1964 James Bond film, Goldfinger – one of twelve Rolls-Royce appearances in the 007 film franchise.

Revealed in 2024, the film’s 60th anniversary year, the motor car takes inspiration from the 1937 Phantom III Sedanca de Ville owned by the title’s eponymous villain, Auric Goldfinger, which was also shown at the event. The story of this motor car and the film is masterfully explored in Phantom Goldfinger, which includes 18- and 24-carat gold detailing, cinematic references, and intricate storytelling elements inspired by the film’s characters, locations and themes.

Further celebrating the centenary of Phantom, an exhibition of eight original artworks charted the evolution of Phantom’s design, and the world it has both inhabited and shaped over the past 100 years. Designers at Goodwood created the series, each capturing a different Phantom generation in the artistic style of its era. The settings of each piece also reflect the influence Phantom has exerted over its ten decades, and the many roles it has played and guises it has assumed.

Guests and media from around the world also witnessed the gathering’s opening parade, which included an immaculately presented example of Phantom V. This celebrated generation of the marque’s flagship motor car has been owned and loved by some of the most significant cultural and political figures in modern history, a reminder of Phantom’s role as a symbol of power, influence, and leadership.

Amid a year of heightened cultural and luxury activity across Italy, the debut of Phantom Goldfinger and the celebration of Phantom’s centenary at the event became a defining expression of Bespoke artistry and enduring cultural significance. This moment reflects not only Phantom’s remarkable legacy but also its ongoing power to inspire, captivate and lead as it enters a new century.

Instagram Keeps Polishing Its Edits App to Woo Video Creators,"As I watch through my computer screen, Tom Bender, the product lead for Instagram’s Edits, places a finger on his smartphone and the software traces an outline around a chubby cat from some meme video. He then takes the furry cutout and drops it over an existing video of himself within the Edits app, adjusting the animal’s opacity to make the cat slightly see-through and ensuring that his own visage in the background stays visible.

This ability to fine-tune overlay opacities was just one of many new and upcoming features he demonstrated in a recent app walkthrough for WIRED. While the Instagram platform was first known for photography, it’s now dominated by video. The new Edits app serves as a companion to Instagram, but one that gives the next generation of video creators all the tools they need to make Reels.

Edits launched last month on Apple and Android devices, after months of delays. Meta, which owns Instagram, is putting Edits forward as a challenger to ByteDance’s CapCut app. That mobile video editing tool, designed to support TikTok creators, was released internationally in 2020 and has become the default choice for creating videos on your phone.

Although Edits initially squeaked past CapCut on Apple’s free downloads charts during release week, the app now sits outside of the 100 most downloaded apps on iOS. It sits far below its main competitor, which is comfortably positioned in the top 10. (Meta declined to share current usage numbers or other statistics for Edits.)

Bender knows he needs to make the app more attractive to creators. So, what’s his plan? Iteration, iteration, iteration.

“We launched a minimum viable product,” he says. “I think the most important thing, from our perspective, is to listen to creators and just launch great features every month or every week.” More video effects and filters are rolling out now. Soon, you’ll be able to adjust the volume across all of the clips in a project. In the next few weeks, an in-app teleprompter—so creators can look right at the camera as they’re reading scripts—is set to drop.

With Edits, Instagram isn’t trying to usurp powerful desktop video editing tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro. Rather, the developers are targeting anyone looking for better ways to craft social media videos on their smartphone. Bender touts Edits’ preproduction tools, such as the existing Inspiration tab for finding video ideas and saving trending Reels, as an example of Instagram integrations designed with mobile video editors in mind. “Creators will have a long Notes app file or DM threads where they send examples of videos,” he says. “There's not a great way to keep track of all your ideas today.” After posting, users can see insights into how the video performed on Instagram Reels inside of the Edits app.

Social media video creators rarely post their work on just a single platform; they’ll edit in one app (typically CapCut) and post to TikTok, Instagram, X, and elsewhere. So why should they consider switching to Edits from software they’re familiar with, beyond the Instagram integrations?",https://www.wired.com/story/instagram-edits-app-new-features/,Technology
THE RESULTS ARE IN: ROYAL CARIBBEAN SELECTS ITS NEXT COHORT OF LOCAL ARTISTS TO FEATURE ON STAR OF THE SEAS,"THE RESULTS ARE IN: ROYAL CARIBBEAN SELECTS ITS NEXT COHORT OF LOCAL ARTISTS TO FEATURE ON STAR OF THE SEAS The Artist Discovery Program will showcase the locally inspired artworks of Caribbean artists on the ultimate family vacation

MIAMI, MAY 29, 2025 – Celebrating the culture and people at the heart of the Caribbean destinations the vacation brand visits, Royal Caribbean has chosen its encore cohort of up-and-coming artists for the Artist Discovery Program. As part of the program, the selected artists will put their work on display for families and vacationers who will set sail on the ultimate family vacation, Star of the Seas.

Representing countries across the Eastern and Western Caribbean, artists from the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti were selected during the second round of the program. Each artist will receive a grant amount between $20,000 and $100,000 to conceptualize and create a custom, large-scale mural that represents the local culture, experience and spirit of their home country. The artworks will be displayed across four highly visible locations on the Icon Class vacation, including the Royal Promenade neighborhood, Star’s embarkation area, the Suite Sun Deck lobby and Suite Sun Deck.

“We are excited about the overwhelming positive response we received from the next edition of the Artist Discovery Program,” said Jay Schneider, chief product innovation officer, Royal Caribbean. “Collaborating with the places we visit is at the heart of what we do and who we are at Royal Caribbean.

This year’s selection is special, and we’re thrilled about the vibrant, beautiful and cultural murals that’ll be on Star of the Seas for years to come.”

Over several months, the vacation brand reviewed nearly 180 applications from across 28 Caribbean countries. Candidates were required to submit unpublished conceptual artwork, a professional resume and a personal statement expressing how their artistic passions, life experiences, cultures and future aspirations inspire their artwork.

The Artist Discovery Program aims to spotlight up-and-coming local artists in the Caribbean by providing a platform for them to showcase their artwork and increase visibility while celebrating the places and people that make Royal Caribbean vacations the vacations of a lifetime. The program was first introduced on Icon of the Seas and has since been a well-received and highly anticipated initiative both on board and at the vacation brand’s exclusive destinations, including Perfect Day at CocoCay and Royal Beach Club Paradise Island, set to debut December 2025 in The Bahamas.

"At Google I/O, the Company's AI Vision Finally Came Into Focus","Google's AI products don't feel like vaporware anymore. Instead, what Google showed at its I/O developers conference last week was full AI maturation.

Google took its AI tech beyond fancy text and image editors to a technological reimagination. The era of searching via keywords is over. The interaction between humans and tech is moving away from binary Boolean logic toward linguistic intuition. The internet that Google helped build is about to change rapidly.

Back in 1998, Google's foundational mission statement was to ""organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."" Under AI, the focus is changing from organization to automatic delivery. The 10-blue-links paradigm is getting the boot. Instead, technology can do the searching and informational synthesis for us, quite literally pushing those traditional blue links further down the page. At the same time, we've seen a rapid dropoff in website traffic across the internet, which some search engine experts are attributing to the increased prevalence of AI products across the web. Even Google executives see the drop in online search traffic to be an inevitability.

With the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, Google was caught flailing, resting on its safe online search business while OpenAI leapfrogged ahead. The sudden release of ChatGPT reportedly caused a ""code red"" within Google, where the company internally restructured around AI. With the majority of Google's revenue coming from ads sold against online search, a new player that could change how people find information online posed, and still poses, a threat. What followed was an arms race between Microsoft-backed OpenAI, creators of ChatGPT, and Google, with billions of dollars being spent, all in hopes of becoming people's default AI.

The two companies have been trading blows ever since, competing to produce the better text, image, code and video generation tools. With the AI market seeing valuations of $826 billion by 2030, according to Statista, there's a massive incentive for Big Tech companies to win these battles early. Since their launches, ChatGPT has grown rapidly, climbing to 400 million active weekly users, while Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, has also grown to 400 million active users across 200 countries and territories.

""Gemini is not just highly capable, it is becoming well-integrated across Google's hardware and software ecosystem,"" said Avi Greengart, president and lead analyst at Techsponential. ""The [Google I/O] keynote still managed to mix messages between AI that is ready today, coming soon or still science fiction for now. But Google is persistently improving not just the AI model sizes but also working to make AI more useful with tools like AI video editors, image generators that can handle text, and contextual awareness that can access your data in its responses.""

It's a significant change from the tone of past Google I/Os. At Google's 2023 conference, Google was showing off how AI could help write emails or adjust photos. The idea was to use AI as a ""good starting point"" to help assist in your daily life.

The following year, Google had renamed its AI assistant Bard to Gemini and opened the valve a little more, showing off concepts of what an AI experience might look like with augmented reality glasses. Google also made publishers uncomfortable with the release of AI Overviews, a new box at the top of Google search that would use AI to automatically answer questions for people, with a list of sources on the side, without needing to click on any of the traditional 10 blue links.

This year, however, there was a notable evolution. Traditional modes of interacting with the internet were entirely thrown out for AI, all in the pursuit of saving time and energy. Whereas last year, Google melded AI at the top of Search, this year, Google showed off AI Mode, a new tab at the top of Google that mixes Gemini with Google Search. In this mode, the 10 blue links are gone. It's a pure AI chat in natural human language. Online shopping removed some of the guesswork with a new Try On mode that uses your picture to create a 3D render of your body to approximate how clothes you're searching for online will look on you. Video calling and AI-powered glasses can now live-translate language, eliminating the need to learn a new tongue. And with a simple set of instructions, it's possible to code complex ideas without needing a degree in computer science.

""At I/O, Google just upped the game by systematically eliminating customer friction across search, shopping, communication and creative workflows to create seamless human experiences,"" said Eric Karofsky, founder of VectorHX, a customer experience strategy company. ""However, AI adoption requires more than cool demos -- the real challenge for companies is how this will be implemented in practice, how processes will need to evolve, and how companies will measure the success of these fundamental shifts in human experience design.""

As someone who's been covering Google's AI ambitions from the start, I'll be the first to tell you that the company's early forays were rocky. Google's AI chatbot would routinely get things wrong, often to the detriment of the company's stock price. It always seemed that the folks at OpenAI had the special sauce to make AI work. The last few months, however, have shown that Google has finally found its footing. Google's AI products are no longer thin condensation to obscure how far behind the company was. Instead, they're a thunderous storm shaking the foundation of the world as we once knew it.",https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/at-google-io-the-companys-ai-vision-finally-came-into-focus/,Technology
"Meet LoveJack, the dating app designed for users to find love using just five words","As Kevin Malone from “The Office” once said, “Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?”

For Julia LeStage and Lisa Le, the creators of a new dating app called LoveJack, finding love online doesn’t have to feel like filling out a mountain of paperwork. Sometimes, all you need are a few carefully chosen words to spark a connection.

LoveJack profiles look like those on other blind dating apps, but with a twist. Instead of blurred or hidden profiles, users see five words chosen by potential matches. When users press and hold on their phone screens (the app doesn’t use swiping mechanics), profile pictures are then revealed.

The five words can be anything from personal traits and jokes to current feelings or even random details, such as the ingredients in their lunch sandwich— an entertaining tactic that we saw one beta user try during our testing.

The idea is that the five-word constraint allows users to be creative while also challenging them to be concise and clever, encouraging more witty conversations and moving away from mundane questions like “What do you do for a living?” or overused pickup lines.

LeStage and Le decided to create LoveJack after being frustrated with the way online dating profiles often resemble job resumes—complete with posed photos, filters, and carefully crafted bios that can feel exaggerated.

“This is not LinkedIn. Where has the fun gone?” LeStage told TechCrunch, reflecting a sentiment shared by many online daters, which may explain why dating giants like Tinder have faced challenges in recent quarters.

LeStage got the idea while working as a judge for the Webby Awards, which notoriously limits winners to five-word speeches. The app also takes inspiration from The New York Times’ popular Wordle game.

She shared with us that when she re-entered the dating scene, apps sucked the fun out of the experience, noting that traditional platforms emphasize superficial judgments based on appearance. So she decided to use the five-word challenge on her dates to spice things up, which helped her realize that people tended to use words that “advertised” their way of thinking.

“It’s the stories behind the words that matter,” LeStage explained. For instance, she spoke with someone who mentioned the word “disco.” When she asked him more about it, she discovered that he had written about the history of disco. “I was like, ‘Well, aren’t you Mr. Interesting?’” she said.

Other standout features include the options to either “Bet On” or “Hold” a match. Betting is similar to liking a profile, but the key difference is that users must place a bet by entering a five-word opening line. This gives the match something interesting to respond to.

Users are limited to a maximum of five matches per day, so they need to be strategic in their choices. This is where LoveJack’s “Hold” feature comes into play, allowing users to bookmark a profile if they’re unsure about someone.

Additionally, the five-word descriptions can be updated every day, adding a social aspect to the app. LoveJack archives all previous entries, allowing users to scroll through everything they’ve written.

“You can see in real time, day to day, how they’re revealing themselves through their five-word updates…Your story is going to change every day, all day, like your mood and the weather,” LeStage added.

In the future, there will also be a premium subscription that will include an “All In” button, the app’s version of a “Super Like,” but in this case, it’ll use all five bets on one person so they can’t match with anyone else for the rest of the day.

When it comes to unmatching someone, LoveJack says it tries to minimize ghosting by requiring users to write a preset message when they set up their profiles. The goodbye note is automatically sent to anyone they unmatch.

Another interesting aspect of LoveJack profiles is that users are encouraged to use fake names to protect their identities. While using pseudonyms on dating platforms is common, it can elicit mixed reactions from users. Some individuals may question the authenticity of potential matches, while others might prefer to keep their personal details private until they become more familiar with the other person.

LoveJack states that it implements a selfie verification process to confirm that the person behind the profile is indeed who they claim to be.

Other safety features include reporting and blocking capabilities, as well as censorship of banned language and explicit photos, and an emergency feature that enables users to contact the police and safety hotlines. (These features were unavailable during our beta testing but are expected to be included in the official version.)

LoveJack is set to launch its iOS app next month. It’ll launch in London first, with plans to roll out to U.S. markets next, including Boston, New York, San Francisco, and others. An Android version of the app will launch in India in late summer.

Starting today, users can join the waiting list for early access by signing up at lovejack.app.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/meet-lovejack-the-dating-app-designed-for-users-to-find-love-using-just-five-words/,Technology
AppHarbr helps block malicious ads for mobile games,"FunCorp had an ad quality problem, so it turned to AppHarbr for a solution. FunCorp is a mobile entertainment company known for viral social content apps like iFunny, where memes and humor connect millions of young users across the U.S.

FunCorp had long and unskippable interstitial ads that were disrupting the user experience, negatively impacting revenue and operational workload.

Tel Aviv, Israel-based AppHarbr is a mobile-first solution for stopping malicious in-app ads to improve the in-app/in-game experience, blocks ads by duration, brand, behavior or interactivity. It auto-detected deceptive ads, enabling FunCorp to manage the situation.

The result was a 30% reduction in manual Quality Assurance (QA) workload. It also saw a 6% lift in app retention tied directly to removing the long interstitials, and there were 25% fewer support tickets related to bad ad experiences. This is the kind of result that every app or game developer monetizing their app with ads could appreciate.

“App and game developers are challenged as they work to balance monetization with user experience,” said Amnon Siev, CEO, AppHarbr, in a statement. “That’s why our ability to increase FunCorp’s retention by 6% after removing broken interstitials highlights the importance working with ad quality management technology.”

AppHarbr supports app developers and game studios to ensure that they can provide their users and advertisers with a malware-free experience. Founded by ad quality solution provider GeoEdge, AppHarbr’s team has spent a decade building a mobile-first solution for stopping malicious ads from impacting the in-app and in-game experience.

The company has more than 15 people and it was founded in 2021. It was based on GeoEdge’s tech, which has been stopping malware online for over a decade.

A mobile-first solution developed by GeoEdge, AppHarbr is the only real-time ad quality solution with real-time blocking – a proactive solution unlike all the other reactive solutions. Appharbr covers malvertising (ad security), ad content, and ad quality (technical violations).

It has behavioral controls designed to eliminate the No. 1 pain point for gaming publishers—unskippable or excessively long full-screen ads—and automatically mute or block ads that play sound without consent.

And it focuses on ad quality. Unlike mediation tools where ad-quality is just one feature, it has just one mission. It’s fully platform-agnostic and free of any conflicts of interest.

AppHarbr said it is more robust and feature-rich than Mediations with Ad Quality Tools like AppLovin Max or Unity Level Play.

Adept and experienced in the detection of malware and malicious and sexually-oriented ads, AppHarbr continuously monitors ads at the pre-impression level in real-time, detecting and preventing any malicious activity.

The company’s technology guards mobile and video ad campaigns, including mobile banner ads, interstitials, native ads, and rewarded videos, from any kind of malicious activity, such as auto-redirects, phishing and drive-by-downloads, to malware inserted in the pre-click or post-click.

Specifically, AppHarbr’s technology is a real-time blocking solution that guards the in-app user experience with customizable controls to manage ad quality. It prevents malicious, offensive, and low-quality ads from impacting visitors, thereby improving app/game ROI. It Ensures a clean ad experience by controlling ads that have skippability issues, autoplay sound, are off-brand, offensive or inappropriate. And it minimizes time spent by Ad Operations handling ad security threats.

The company said it keeps users safe by eliminating security threats at their source and proactively blocking malvertising, enforcing privacy protections, and ensuring data compliance

FunCorp has more than 50 million installs and eight million monthly active users. The average session time for its games is 18 minutes to 22 minutes.

“Beyond revenue, improved ad quality also provides operational efficiencies by reducing the time and resources app and game developers spend on Quality Assurance (QA) and addressing support tickets,” said Siev.

The company’s clients include game and app developers including Voodoo, Hypercell, Sunday, Appodeal, and Softowel Games.",https://venturebeat.com/games/appharbr-helps-block-malicious-ads-for-mobile-games/,Technology
"Next-gen biobattery shrinks tumor, paving way for drug-free cancer treatments","This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

A pioneering biobattery has been shown to reduce tumor growth in the body and could hold the key to a new drug-free immunotherapy treatment in cancer patients.

The breakthrough, a global collaboration between Distinguished Professor Gordon Wallace and Professor Caiyun Wang from the Intelligent Polymer Research Institute (IPRI) at the University of Wollongong (UOW) and researchers from Jilin University in China, is outlined in a new paper published in Science Advances.

Biobatteries have the same basic parts as regular batteries—two electrodes (anode and cathode), a separator and an electrolyte—but use biological processes to create electricity. The paper examines how biobatteries can be used to target tumors and spark a localized immunotherapy response in the body.

When the battery is in use, tiny particles called electrons are released from one electrode (the anode) and travel to the other (the cathode), where they're consumed. These movements are accompanied by chemical reactions that harness the body's immune response.

When the biobattery was placed around subcutaneous tumor sites (tumors that occur between the skin and muscle), the treatment reduced the tumor size from over 1,000 mm3 to just 4 mm3, a reduction of 99.6% after 14 days.

Professor Wallace said the research builds on the team's previous work in biobatteries and the results were extremely promising for the treatment of cancer.

""The biobattery concept was conceived several years ago when we looked at conventional implantable batteries and thought, 'what a waste of space and why are they not designed to interact with tissue directly?'"" he said.

""In this research, the by-products of battery discharge—zinc and manganese ions—create a chemical environment that inhibits tumor growth.

""If we are clever with electrode choice, biobatteries can be more effective in treating medical conditions, including mobilizing the body's immune response and shrinking tumors.""

While current from the battery can inhibit tumor growth, when it is combined with the targeted release of metal ions, it has a dramatic impact, stimulating immunotherapy, a powerful and effective tool for treating cancer.

Professor Wang, a Professorial Fellow in IPRI, said the release of zinc and manganese ions help the body's immune system find and destroy cancer cells.

""We can place the battery directly at the tumor site so that it will continuously release metal ions right where the cancer is. This helps kill the cancer cells while also helping the patient's own immune system recognize and attack the tumor,"" she said.

Associate Professor Jia Xiaoteng from Jilin University said the research could provide a new path for treating tumors without the use of harsh drugs, potentially reducing side effects and improving the patient's quality of life.

""This work demonstrates a powerful electrochemical tool for drug-free cancer immunotherapy, which may open an avenue for sustained and targeted delivery of substances that activate the immune system,"" he said.

Professor Wallace said this caliber of research was made possible by the collaboration between UOW and Jilin University and the next step is to ensure the biobattery makes its way into the world.

""We will build on our extensive clinical network to create a preclinical and clinical research. We are committed to ensuring this device is employed and able to help people as soon as possible,"" he said.

""Big global challenges require integrated global research teams to tackle them if we are to make progress.""

Black Panther game cancelled: EA also shuts down Cliffhanger Studio games,"Electronic Arts has cancelled its Black Panther game and closed the studio behind it, Cliffhanger Games, less than two years after the project was announced.

The decision was confirmed following a report by IGN, and marks another chapter in a series of layoffs and restructurings at the gaming giant.

The cancellation was announced internally via an email from Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment and Technology, who said the move was part of an effort to “sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.”

While the Black Panther project is no more, EA stated it would continue development on other high-profile titles, including the Iron Man game announced in 2022, the next Star Wars: Jedi instalment, and a new entry in the Mass Effect series.

The single player Black Panther video game has been canceled at Electronic Arts and Cliffhanger Games has been closed.



(Source: IGN) pic.twitter.com/xFUrIEeoWJ — The Game Awards (@thegameawards) May 28, 2025

Core franchises such as Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends will remain a priority for the company.

“These decisions are hard,” Miele wrote, acknowledging the human cost of the restructuring. “They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them—including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles.”

The end of Cliffhanger Games comes shortly after EA laid off an estimated 300–400 employees in April, and cancelled two early-stage “incubation projects,” including a new Titanfall concept.

Those actions followed significant cuts at BioWare earlier this year, after Dragon Age: The Veilguard reportedly underperformed.

Cliffhanger Games was established in 2023 with the ambitious goal of delivering a narrative-rich, single-player Black Panther experience.

Its swift closure underscores the increasing financial and creative pressures within the gaming industry—particularly for projects outside EA’s established blockbuster catalogue.",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2548414/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-shuts-down-cliffhanger-games-studio,Technology
New Browser Exploit Technique Undermines Phishing Detection,"A new browser-based phishing technique has made it harder for users to spot malicious websites, according to recent cybersecurity research.

The method, known as a Fullscreen Browser-in-the-Middle (BitM) attack and discovered by SquareX, exploits standard browser functionality to convincingly mask fake login pages as legitimate ones, without relying on bugs or vulnerabilities.

This approach builds on traditional BitM tactics, where attackers use remote browser sessions to show real login interfaces in a pop-up window, tricking users into submitting their credentials. The key limitation of earlier versions was the visible presence of a suspicious URL in the browser address bar.

However, the latest variant uses the browser’s Fullscreen API to hide that URL entirely by rendering the attacker-controlled content in fullscreen mode, making detection significantly more difficult.

Safari Browsers Particularly Exposed

The effectiveness of the technique varies by browser.

While Chrome and Firefox display brief notifications when fullscreen mode is activated, these warnings are often subtle and can be easily overlooked, especially when attackers mimic the look and feel of legitimate interfaces.

Safari presents a greater concern: it does not show any messaging when entering fullscreen mode, providing attackers with a clear advantage. A slight swipe animation is the only visual cue, and it’s not one that users typically associate with a potential security risk.

Key differences across browsers include:

Chrome and Firefox show temporary fullscreen warnings with limited detail

Firefox includes domain information, though the notice vanishes after a few seconds

Safari shows no warning message, only a subtle swipe animation

In one example, attackers used malvertising to lure victims to a fake Figma login page. The site appeared authentic, and clicking the login button triggered fullscreen mode.

The victim then unknowingly submitted their credentials through a remote browser controlled by the attacker, granting access not only to the compromised account but also to any other apps the user accessed during that session.

Addressing the Risk

Unlike traditional phishing attacks that depend on typosquatting or blatant URL spoofing, this method relies on legitimate browser behavior. This makes it particularly difficult for security tools that monitor network traffic or endpoint activity to detect. As a result, mitigation efforts must shift toward user awareness and browser-level protections.

Staying vigilant when login prompts appear in fullscreen mode, especially if the transition feels unexpected, is crucial. Users are advised to navigate to services directly rather than through ads, emails or social media posts.

Choosing browsers that offer clearer visual indicators for fullscreen activity can provide an additional layer of defense.

Security awareness training also plays a key role, helping users recognize subtle signs of manipulation and understand how browser APIs can be abused in sophisticated phishing campaigns.",https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/browser-exploit-technique/,Technology
Billions of session cookies for sale sparks security warning,"A VPN vendor says billions of stolen cookies currently on sale either on dark web or Telegram-based marketplaces remain active and exploitable.

More than 93.7 billion of them are currently available for criminals to buy online and of those, between 7-9 percent are active, on average, according to NordVPN's breakdown of stolen cookies by country.

Adrianus Warmenhoven, cybersecurity advisor at NordVPN, said: ""Cookies may seem harmless, but in the wrong hands, they're digital keys to our most private information. What was designed to enhance convenience is now a growing vulnerability exploited by cybercriminals worldwide.

""Most people don't realize that a stolen cookie can be just as dangerous as a password, despite being so willing to accept cookies when visiting websites, just to get rid of the prompt at the bottom of the screen.

""However, once these are intercepted, a cookie can give hackers direct access to all sorts of accounts containing sensitive data, without any login required.""

The vast majority of stolen cookies (90.25 percent) contain ID data, used to uniquely identify users and deliver targeted ads.

They can also contain data such as names, home and email addresses, locations, passwords, phone numbers, and genders, although these data points are only present in around 0.5 percent of all stolen cookies. The risk of ruinous personal data exposure as a result of cookie theft is therefore pretty slim.

Aside from ID cookies, the other statistically significant type of data that these can contain are details of users' sessions. Over 1.2 billion of these are still up for grabs (roughly 6 percent of the total), and these are generally seen as more of a concern.

From FBI-led, Sesame Street-inspired takedowns of stolen cookie marketplaces, to Big Tech authentication overhauls, the threat of stolen session cookies is one that is actively being addressed by the tech industry.

Cybercriminals can feasibly take these session cookies and pose as others on web pages, authenticate into services without the need for credentials, and in many cases this can also bypass MFA.

Stolen session cookies are therefore highly attractive to cybercrims, who can use them to gather information from email accounts, banking apps, corporate systems, and more.

They can also be a boon to ransomware crooks who can move laterally around a potential victim's network if they use cookie-based SSO for authentication, which then allows crims access to sensitive business data, and potentially higher privileges.

The most common way crooks can get hold of these cookies is through infostealer malware, with Redline being prevalent (it was linked to 44 percent of the total cookies researchers found).

The Vidar, LummaC2, and Meta infostealers took the second, third, and fourth spots on the list, although the latter two, as well as Redline, have been the subject of successful law enforcement disruption efforts.

Access to these malware strains is relatively affordable, given the profit that can be made from hoovering up users' digital valuables. Cops said crooks could purchase Lumma for as little as $250, while Redline and Meta were going for as little as $150 for the most basic tier of features.

However, while the threat presented by stolen cookies is severe, it should be said that if a user's PC, or one belonging to an organization, is infected with infostealer malware, by that point it could be argued the threat that malware presents is arguably greater than the cookies, which are statistically unlikely to contain usable session data.

NordVPN's first piece of advice for those looking to mitigate the threat of stolen cookies might irk Europeans as it relates to the long-lived frustration of website cookie banners.

""Think twice before accepting the cookies,"" the company said, which many would argue would be easier if it weren't so onerous to do so every day.

""The first step towards making yourself safer is understanding that not all cookies are necessary, and just because you can accept all cookies, doesn't mean you have to. Whenever possible, reject unnecessary cookies, especially third-party ones or those tracking your behaviour. Most websites still function fine without them.""

Keeping devices updated with the latest security fixes is naturally the way to go if preventing infostealer infections is the priority, which it should be. Cleaning up browser histories and purging unnecessary cookies as part of that process is also a good idea.

""Many users don't realize that active sessions may persist even after they close their browser,"" said Warmenhoven. ""Clearing this data helps reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access. Lastly, always check the privacy settings on your online accounts to ensure you only share information with trusted services."" ®",https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/29/billions_of_cookies_available/,Technology

Fake Bitdefender website used to spread infostealer malware,"Cybercriminals are using a fake Bitdefender antivirus website to spread the VenomRAT malware in a campaign aimed at stealing people’s credentials for financial accounts, according to new research.

The attackers created a website that closely mimics Bitdefender’s legitimate Windows download page. Victims are infected after clicking a seemingly authentic “Download for Windows” button, which delivers a malicious archive. The archive contains executable files configured to deploy VenomRAT, which is used for remote access, keylogging and data exfiltration.

Researchers at cybersecurity firm DomainTools also identified code linked to SilentTrinity and StormKitty — two open-source malware tools — within the same payload. The inclusion of these tools suggests a dual strategy, according to researchers: harvesting financial data and crypto wallet credentials via StormKitty, while using SilentTrinity to maintain stealthy, persistent access.

“These tools work in concert: VenomRAT sneaks in, StormKitty grabs your passwords and digital wallet info, and SilentTrinity ensures the attacker can stay hidden and maintain control,” DomainTools said in its report.

Beyond impersonating Bitdefender, the threat actor likely spoofed other trusted entities, including banks and IT service providers, to broaden the reach of its phishing activities.

Bitdefender told Recorded Future News it was aware of the campaign and first detected the rogue site in early May. “We monitor the internet for websites using typosquatting or other techniques to mislead the user into believing these are official Bitdefender websites,” the company said.

Bitdefender products flagged both the malware payload and the URL as malicious. The company is working with its DNS provider, Cloudflare, and other partners to fully remove the site from the internet.

Because VenomRAT is widely sold as a service on criminal forums, attributing the campaign to a specific group remains challenging. “Our efforts go into making sure that we correctly identify VenomRAT and other infostealer infections and block them before they harm internet users,” Bitdefender said.",https://therecord.media/fake-bitdefender-website-venomrat-infostealer,Technology
"50M $HVLO Airdrop to Prioritize Uptime, Loyalty, and Integrity","LONDON and AMSTERDAM, May 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hivello, a DePIN aggregator that enables users to earn by monetizing idle (computing) resources across multiple DePINs (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), has confirmed its commitment to rewarding meaningful contributions through its hugely upgraded and more sophisticated $HVLO airdrop program.

Hivello’s airdrops were never intended to be simple giveaways, they are a core part of its strategy to recognize real users who are helping to power the decentralized physical infrastructure ecosystem (DePIN).

As the platform grows and attracts more participants globally, Hivello has announced that its next airdrop will happen in August 2025, will be for 50 million HVLO tokens and most importantly will be materially different from Hivello’s first airdrop.

Airdrop 2 will focus on users who consistently demonstrate high-value behavior such as sustained node uptime, long-term engagement, and the provision of real resources to DePIN networks.

Hivello is developing an improved variable reward framework to ensure that $HVLO rewards distributed go only to legitimate node runners.

Behavior intended to manipulate or exploit the airdrop system, such as spinning up fake or inactive nodes, or buying and selling node accounts, will not be rewarded. These practices run counter to the spirit of Hivello’s community-driven approach and will be automatically detected and result in zero rewards in this and future airdrop campaigns.

""Airdrops shouldn’t just reward activity, they should reward contribution,” said Domenic Carosa, Co-founder & Chairman of Hivello. “This next phase is about identifying and supporting the people who are showing up, powering real infrastructure, and helping to grow the DePIN ecosystem alongside us.”

Hivello views airdrops as a meaningful way to onboard the right users—those who believe in decentralization, contribute honestly, and help bring the Web2 audience into the world of Web3. With more than 10 DePIN protocols already integrated and thousands of contributors providing real computing power, Hivello continues to push forward in building the future of DePIN.

About Hivello :

Hivello is an aggregator of DePIN projects that allows any user to participate in a variety of DePIN networks with just a few clicks. This eliminates the technical hurdles that many users face when trying to join these networks, and allows users to earn passive income by mobilizing their idle computers.We aim to create a simple app that allows users to contribute their computer resources and earn passive income, with no technical knowledge required. It's as easy as downloading, installing, and running nodes, making complex technologies accessible and beneficial to all.

VR tool pioneered to enhance athlete well-being makes headlines,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Credit: Areous Ahmad from Pexels

An innovative project which uses virtual reality to enhance the mental well-being and resilience of young athletes is attracting the attention of major sporting organizations across the UK.

The University of Derby has teamed up with My Energy Game (MEG) to develop a unique virtual reality game played using a VR headset, which aims to help young athletes to better understand and address their self-development.

Pioneered by MEG—a sports psychology company that works to improve athlete well-being and education through digital resources—the project focuses on sport psychological intervention using VR tools.

Its aim is to facilitate self-development for enhanced well-being and performance, acting as a preventative measure against mental illness.

The game takes athletes through an initial profiling tool that focuses on key attributes associated with self-development.

This will focus on attributes, such as communication, embracing change, managing disappointment, relationship management, and leadership. The player can then select a game that relates to the attribute that they wish to develop, and progress through the learning experience.

The project has attracted attention from the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) with PFA CEO Maheta Molango visiting the University of Derby to test the prototype.

It has also resulted in a one-year strategic partnership between the University of Derby and MEG; a company set up by former West Ham United assistant coach Edu Rubio, and psychologist Tina Hurst, together with business partners Mubeen and Zee Uppal, offering resources such as workshops, webinars and coaching aimed at improving the performance of young athletes.

Dr. Andy Hooton, Head of School of Sport and Exercise Science at the University of Derby, said, ""The use of gamified virtual reality tools for positive effect—including to enhance self-development and well-being—is an emerging and promising field. It is an area that is constantly evolving, and the University of Derby is proud to be at the forefront of research into VR and artificial intelligence.

""This partnership with MEG further enables the growth of our industry-engaged provision at the University of Derby in delivering excellence and innovation.

""Moreover, it focuses on our shared values of personal and professional development for well-being and performance, assisting young athletes in enabling resilience against mental health challenges they may face.""

Thousands of ASUS Routers Hijacked in Stealthy Backdoor Campaign,"Hackers have gained unauthorized, persistent access to about 9000 ASUS routers in an ongoing exploitation campaign, according to cyber intelligence firm GreyNoise.

Unlike typical malware attacks, the attackers maintain long-term access without dropping malware or leaving traces. Instead, the operation uses the routers’ own legitimate features to create persistent backdoors that survive firmware updates and reboots.

It appears to be part of a stealth operation to assemble a distributed network of backdoor devices, potentially laying the groundwork for a future botnet.

The methods employed during this campaign mirror strategies typically associated with sophisticated, prolonged campaigns conducted by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors using operational relay box (ORB) networks.

Although GreyNoise has not made any attributions, the degree of operational skill exhibited implies that the perpetrator is a formidable and well-funded opponent.

Targeting ORB devices has recently been a typical cyber espionage tactic deployed by Chinese-sponsored hackers.

GreyNoise shared its findings in a May 28 report and a companion technical analysis by GreyNoise Labs.

ASUS Router Exploitation Campaign’s Intrusion Chain

The malicious campaign was discovered by GreyNoise researchers on March 18 using a GreyNoise-made AI-powered network traffic analysis tool called SIFT alongside fully emulated ASUS router profiles running in the GreyNoise Global Observation Grid.

Specifically, SIFT detected multiple anomalous network payloads attempting to disable TrendMicro security features in ASUS routers and then exploit vulnerabilities. Novel tradecraft in ASUS AiProtection features on those routers was also identified.

Upon investigating the source of the anomalous traffic detected by SIFT, the GreyNoise researchers discovered thousands of compromised ASUS routers.

As of May 27, approximately 9000 routers have been affected, with the number steadily increasing.

The infection chain, analyzed by GreyNoise, unfolds in the following steps:

Attackers gain access using brute-force login attempts and two authentication bypass exploits for zero-day vulnerabilities, which were not assigned any Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers Attackers exploit CVE-2023-39780, a high-severity command injection flaw affecting ASUS RT-AX55, to execute system commands – patched by ASUS in a recent firmware update Attackers use legitimate ASUS features to enable SSH access on a custom port (TCP/53282), insert an attacker-controlled public key for remote access, with the backdoor stored in non-volatile memory (NVRAM), not on disk – meaning it is not removed during firmware upgrades or reboots Attackers disable router logging to evade detection

In its report, GreyNoise noted that while ASUS patched CVE-2023-39780 in a recent firmware update, the attacker’s SSH configuration changes cannot be removed by the update.

The initial login bypass techniques are patched but do not have assigned CVEs.

GreyNoise initially deferred disclosure of this investigation to inform government and industry partners before sharing its findings with the public.

On May 22, cyber threat intelligence firm Sekoia announced the compromise of ASUS routers as part of a campaign it called “ViciousTrap.”

ASUS Router Weakness Mitigation Recommendations

In its report, GreyNoise provided a list of recommendations to mitigate the threats posed by this malicious exploitation campaign:

Check ASUS routers for SSH access on TCP/53282

Review the authorized_keys file for unauthorized entries

Block the following four IP addresses: 101.99.91.151; 101.99.94.173; 79.141.163.179; 111.90.146.237

If a compromise is suspected, perform a full factory reset and reconfigure the ASUS router manually

Veson Nautical Expands IMOS Platform with AI-Powered Claims Management,"BOSTON, May 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Veson Nautical (Veson), a global leader in maritime data and freight management solutions, today announced the launch of IMOS X Claims CoCaptain, an AI-powered extension of claims management capabilities within IMOS designed to streamline the demurrage claims process.

For decades, Veson has partnered with clients worldwide to solve challenges and drive continuous innovation across the full freight management lifecycle through the IMOS Platform. One challenge that could not be ignored is claims management. Claims teams are often overwhelmed by manual processes and time-consuming document collection—spending the bulk of their time preparing to process claims rather than analyzing them. This burden only grows with large, complex cases, leaving even less time for strategic decision-making.

Developed using the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, Claims CoCaptain marks a significant evolution in managing claims. The solution automates time-intensive tasks, speeds up decision-making, and empowers analysts to focus on outcomes that drive business value. As part of the IMOS Platform, changes in Claims CoCaptain automatically update P&Ls, financial reporting and integrated systems throughout the claim lifecycle–providing a single end-to-end platform.

“Claims CoCaptain reflects our deep commitment to solving maritime challenges with technology that is both innovative and grounded in real-world workflows,” said Eric Christofferson, Chief Product Officer at Veson Nautical. “As the claims settlement process is a critical and costly part of the freight contract lifecycle, managing both from a single platform provides numerous efficiencies and reduces errors. The IMOS foundation and data will allow claims specialists and operators to more strategically manage the claims outcome.”



Built on IMOS. Powered by AI.

Claims CoCaptain is a module offered within the IMOS Platform, Veson’s market-leading solution for commercial freight management and voyage execution, and is accessed through IMOS X, Veson's new, fast, and mobile-friendly user experience. It was developed with maritime claims teams in mind, drawing on twenty years of domain expertise and focused research and development.

Analysts typically spend countless hours reviewing statements of facts (SOFs), gathering timestamps, and calculating laytime—often across fragmented sources. Claims CoCaptain automates much of this manual work by using AI to organize and extract key data from emails and voyage documents in a centralized workspace. This enables analysts to concentrate on strategic aspects of the claim, improving accuracy, responsiveness, and overall outcomes.

Improving visibility and creating a decision advantage

Claims teams have long operated with limited visibility into the size, scope, and urgency of active claims—making it difficult to prioritize workloads and respond quickly. Claims CoCaptain solves this by centralizing information in one place and intelligently categorizing claims based on complexity and time sensitivity.

IMOS X Claims CoCaptain is now available to existing and new IMOS Platform clients. Learn more and request a demo at www.veson.com/products/imos-x/claims.

X hits pause on its encrypted DMs feature,"In Brief

Social network X said on Thursday that it is pausing its encrypted DMs feature as it works to make some improvements.

In a post on X, the company’s engineering account said users will be able to access their existing encrypted messages, but they won’t be able to send new ones. It did not mention when the feature will be available again.

After Elon Musk bought Twitter, he announced ambitious plans to overhaul direct messages and compete with privacy-focused messaging service Signal.

The company rolled out the encrypted DMs feature in 2023 for verified users, but it comes with several drawbacks. For instance, the feature isn’t available for group chats, and only supports encryption for text and links, not media. It also does not offer protections against man-in-the-middle attacks, and your encrypted conversations do not carry over to new devices.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/x-hits-pause-on-its-encrypted-dms-feature/,Technology
WhatsApp is testing a simple Logout option,"WhatsApp is constantly working on new features, which are generally seen in beta versions before being released. That's also the case today, when some enterprising folks dug through the latest WhatsApp beta for Android and found an upcoming Logout option in Account settings.

Once it goes live, when you tap it you'll be presented with two options - one of those will have you log out while also erasing all of your data and preferences, while the other will keep your data and preferences.



WhatsApp Logout option in testing

If you pick the route that will erase your data, it's basically just like uninstalling WhatsApp. It logs you out and deletes all app data and preferences, but doesn't remove you from groups. On the other hand, the option that won't erase data simply logs you out without touching anything else - your chats, group chats, data, and preferences will all be there waiting for you when you get back. You can then restore everything easily by simply signing in again with your phone number.

So, with that in mind, this feature seems to be tailor made for those who want to take a short break from WhatsApp for whatever reason. The Logout option still shows an ""Internal"" badge which tells us that it's being actively tested internally in the WhatsApp development team. The next step should be a full beta release for everyone, followed of course by the stable release sometime after that.

Study Provides “Molecular Roadmap” to How Asbestos Exposure Causes Mesothelioma,"A collaborative study conducted by the renowned Sbarro Health Research Organization (SHRO) and the University of Siena in Italy has helped scientists better understand how asbestos exposure can lead to malignant pleural mesothelioma, the rare and deadly form of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs. The research provides an answer to the long-standing question of how mesothelioma tumors form, and shows that asbestos can trigger changes in gene activity, also known as gene expression, that may eventually damage DNA and lead to cancer.

Researchers Use Existing Data to Analyze Genes in Mesothelioma Tumors

The mesothelioma study was published in the recent edition of Experimental and Molecular Pathology and was led by Professor Antonio Giordano and Professor Elisa Frullanti. Their work was funded by Italy’s National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work (INAIL). The scientists used publicly available RNA sequencing data to provide them with a snapshot of which genes are turned on or off within a given sample. They then created a bioinformatics pipeline, a process that uses advanced computer tools to analyze data.

The goal of the study was to see whether there are patterns in gene activity that are common to people who have both malignant pleural mesothelioma and a history of asbestos exposure. The researchers successfully identified a set of genes that acted differently in malignant pleural mesothelioma patients than in healthy individuals. The genes they found were notably those involved in processes like maintaining the balance of ions in cells, responding to oxidative stress, and keeping cell structures organized. These changes may explain how asbestos exposure starts the chain reaction that leads to cancer.

Mesothelioma Study Emphasizes the Need for Precision Medicine Approach

One of the lead researchers, Dr. Frullanti, said the study goes beyond listing genes—it builds a “molecular roadmap” showing how asbestos causes mesothelioma. Understanding this roadmap could help doctors predict which patients are most at risk, diagnose the deadly cancer earlier, and even develop more targeted treatments in the future.

Dr. Giordano added that this mesothelioma research supports “precision medicine,” the idea of tailoring healthcare to individual patients based on their genetic and environmental risk factors. Because decades can go by between asbestos exposure and the appearance of mesothelioma symptoms, finding better ways to diagnose and manage the disease is a top priority. This study provides new clues that could lead to earlier detection and better outcomes for patients.

For people who’ve been exposed to asbestos, studies like these provide real hope for improved screening and treatment.

Microsoft unveils “centralized” software update tool for Windows,"Microsoft is looking to streamline the software updating process for IT admins and users by providing a Windows-native update orchestration platform, and to help organizations upgrade their computer fleet to Windows 11 with the help of Windows Backup for Organizations.

The software update orchestration platform

“Today, line-of-business apps, Windows components, Visual Studio, and other products are updated independently,” says Microsoft Product Manager Angie Chen.

“Updates across the Windows ecosystem can feel like a fragmented experience for IT admins managing applications that have their own update orchestrators (e.g., line of business) and commercial management tools that handle their own download, install, restart, and notifications.”

This new platform aims to provide a less intrusive and confusing update experience for users by eliminating conflicting notifications and minimizing interruptions, and a simplified management of updates across their organization for IT administrators.

The platform is still in private preview and Microsoft is urging developers and product teams to sign up for it.

“Apps or management tools that are part of the preview will be able to access the Windows Update orchestration platform through a set of Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs and PowerShell commands,” Chen explained.

The developers and product teams must first register with the orchestrator as an update provider, by providing the path to an executable file that contains the logic to scan for new updates.

When a new update is ready, they provide the orchestrator with information such as the update title and version, the installation deadline on managed devices, whether the update requires devices to be restarted to complete the installation, etc., so it can schedule the download and installation of the update.

“Updates are intelligently deferred based on user activity, system performance, connection to AC power, and sustainable times to update,” Chen added. If user interaction is needed, the orchestrator prompts them via native Windows Update notifications.

If a scan for or the download or install of a new update fails, the orchestrator will reschedule it.

Windows Backup for Organizations

October 14, 2025 – the date when Windows 10 will reach its end of support – is approaching quickly, and Microsoft is hoping many organizations will transition to using Windows 11.

To make the transition more appealing, Microsoft is releasing Windows Backup for Organizations, a service / feature that will make backing up the settings of Windows 10 and 11 devices and restoring them on a Microsoft Entra joined device easier.

“With Windows Backup for Organizations, get your users up and running as quickly as possible with their familiar Windows settings already in place. It doesn’t matter if they’re experiencing a device reimage or reset,” Microsoft Product Manager Miranda Leschke noted.

To use the backup functionality, devices must be Microsoft Entra hybrid joined or Microsoft Entra joined, and must be running a current supported version of Windows 10 or Windows 11.

The restore functionality will only work on Microsoft Entra joined devices running Windows 11, version 22H2 and later, and organizations must have an active Microsoft Intune test tenant and Microsoft Intune service administrator permissions.

The feature is currently in limited public preview, available only to select members of the Microsoft Management Customer Connection Program.

Kaschke shapes light with DoPchoice Snapgrids,"Colorado-based gaffer and lighting influencer (with the apropos handle @colorado_gaffer) Tyler Kaschke, ICLS, brings precision, professionalism, and pragmatic positivity to every set. With a prolific commercial lighting portfolio, Kaschke’s setups are as efficient as they are effective. He relies on DoPchoice Snapgrids to help control spill and maintain polished, heightened naturalism, especially when working in tight interiors. On a recent Trust & Wills three-spot ad campaign, Kaschke turned to a Snapgrid with a LiteMat to create the desired look set in a quirky vintage home.

Located in a 1970s-era house complete with wood paneling and shag carpeting, the Trust & Wills video campaign features adult siblings playing literal tongue-in-cheek games parodying an inheritance battle. “Working with DP Brian Hollers is great, he’s very collaborative. The shoot called for a long tracking move using a Fisher 11 Dolly and jib arm,” Kaschke says. “The house had low ceilings and a unique stylized look. We were using Astera Tubes and LiteMats, which are excellent, but tend to spread light everywhere if you don’t add control.” With eight-foot ceilings and a large dolly-jib to work around, space was at a premium. But Kaschke was hardly phased–he already had exactly what he needed in his two-ton gaffer’s van.

“The look we were going for depended on directional light—soft, but not sloppy.” Kaschke and key grip Jean-Paul Montoulieu pre-rigged a lighting setup off site, constructing a living room-length wall spreader where a LiteMat 8 with Snapgrid could be mounted as the overhead key. “For me DoPchoice is kind of the only option,” the gaffer explains. “Specifically, when it comes to LiteMat and similar brands, no one else is making compatible Snapgrids.” The accessory from DoPchoice is a lightweight, yet sturdy fabric grid that easily affixes directly to the face of a light fixture to offer uniquely directed light control on set.

“There was a period when LiteMats existed without Snapgrids. Back then we had to rely on hodgepodge, DIY solutions to control the spill. I used to tape cinefoil to the bottom of a light to keep from lighting up the walls,” Kaschke recalls. “But now there’s DoPchoice with a reputation for professional high-quality goods.” In one tighter setup, Kaschke augmented window light from the side using a LiteMat 4 with a Snapgrid to direct the light. Opposite that fixture, he added an Astera Titan Tube with its own one-square-wide Snapgrid, rigged near the ceiling to create balanced, beautiful illumination.

“Controlling spill lets you make things feel elevated without feeling lit,” Kaschke explains. “You want that heightened naturalism, and especially when you’re in a small space with a low ceiling, you don’t want uncontrolled bounce lighting up your backgrounds.” He credits Snapgrids for helping streamline his workflow and bringing a professional edge to each job. “Using a Snapgrid instead of paper tape or cinefoil saves time, saves space, and frankly makes you look like you know what you’re doing,” he laughs. “Now, every LiteMat I rent goes out with a Snapgrid—it’s not even a question.”

For Kaschke, the term ‘Snapgrid’ has become so integrated into the workflow it’s practically generic. “It’s like Kleenex at this point,” he says. “It’s a no-brainer.”

Four Showstopping New Pieces Real Watch Guys Are Lining Up For,"Welcome to Watch Guy Watches, GQ’s monthly curation of high-end timepieces for the true watch nerds among us. This May, MB&F drops its first-ever dress watch, Vacheron Constantin adds a minute repeater to the Overseas collection, Bvlgari teams up with Gübelin on a special edition, and Zenith puts a lapis lazuli dial on its Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar.

When it comes to reimagining what a watch is and how it looks, no one thinks more radically than Max Büsser of MB&F. The brand is divided into distinct categories. MB&F’s Legacy Machines are a tribute to traditional horology, Horological Machines rethink watches as spaceships and bulldogs, while the M.A.D.Editions bring unrivaled creativity to the “affordable” timepieces sector. This month, MB&F set its sights on revolutionizing another category: dress watches.

Part of the brand’s 20th anniversary celebrations, the new SP One—the inaugural model in the brand’s “Special Projects” collection—is also MB&F’s most compact timepiece. Based on a sketch initially codenamed “Three Circles,” it takes the form of a 38-mm dress watch in platinum or 18K rose gold, within which a unique “floating” dial is suspended. The time subdial, balance, and barrel make up the display. Dual sapphire crystals front and back allow the wearer to examine the beautiful handwork and sophisticated design from any angle.

©Laurent Xavier Moulin / www.laurentxaviermoulin.ch

MB&F’s handiwork makes it appear as if the dial is floating in the center. Many of the elements that power this watch are hidden under the three visible elements while bridges hook into an outer rim to keep it all held up. These types of floating dials are still rare in the watch world but we’ve seen a couple of recent notable examples, like Louis Vuitton’s new Taiko Spin Time. I’m also reminded of the Cartier Masse Mystérieuse from 2022. Hopefully, watch brands can pick up the pace and start producing these very cool-looking watches more frequently.

All the beauty of the SP One isn’t reserved to the dial side either. Flip it over to find a hand-wound caliber that delivers 72 hours of power via 191 components. The movement showcases numerous traditional hand-finishing techniques—gold chatons, hand engraving and polishing, internal angles, satin and polished surfaces, etc.—as well as the delivery of signature modern aesthetics (micro-blasted surfaces, for example). The case itself, either in 18K rose gold with an anthracite flange or platinum with a sky-blue flange (the flange is the outer ring holding up all the parts), is a pebble-shaped thing of beauty.

With detached lugs that connect via the caseback, a 10 o’clock crown, and a height of 12 mm, this isn’t exactly a traditional compact dress watch. Nevertheless, it remains relatively svelte and elegant, especially for MB&F. And while the DLC-treated black time display dial is certainly handsome and legible, it’s almost an afterthought when considered within the context of the suspended design.",https://www.gq.com/story/watch-guy-watches-may-2025,Technology
The many ironies in Pakistan launching a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"Across major Pakistani cities, citizens endure crippling electricity outages, yet the government has allocated 2,000 MW of surplus electricity for bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres. Alongside this, there are issues related to FATF, too read more

Pakistan, a nation grappling with chronic energy shortages, regulatory challenges, and financial scrutiny, has made headlines with its ambitious foray into cryptocurrency.

Bilal Bin Saqib, the newly appointed Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Crypto and Blockchain, recently unveiled the nation’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, designed to hold digital assets as a sovereign reserve.

While presented as a bold step towards embracing digital finance, the move is fraught with contradictions that border on irony.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Lights out at home, but power for Bitcoin?

Across major Pakistani cities, citizens endure crippling electricity outages, often extending beyond 12 hours daily. Amid this chronic energy crisis, the government has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.

This stark inequality points to the government’s misplaced priorities, as ordinary Pakistanis grapple with high electricity bills and prolonged blackouts.

The roots of this paradox lie in the country’s energy infrastructure. Pakistan has significantly increased its electricity generation capacity, reaching approximately 42,131 MW by March 2024. This expansion includes coal, solar, and hydroelectric power plants, many financed under the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.

However, the transmission and distribution infrastructure has not kept pace, leading to inefficiencies and frequent power outages.

Furthermore, the energy sector is burdened by a circular debt exceeding $10 billion, resulting from a cycle of unpaid bills between consumers, distribution companies, and power producers. This financial strain hampers maintenance and upgrades of the grid, exacerbating power shortages despite surplus generation.

Chinese-funded projects under CPEC have added substantial capacity to Pakistan’s power sector. While these projects have increased generation, they come with high capacity payments, obligating Pakistan to pay for electricity regardless of actual consumption. This arrangement contributes to elevated electricity tariffs and financial stress on the energy sector.

Balancing on FATF’s tightrope

Further complicating matters is Pakistan’s fraught relationship with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global watchdog against money laundering and terrorist financing. Historically, Pakistan has frequently oscillated in and out of FATF’s grey list, indicating heightened scrutiny and ongoing compliance issues.

Pakistan was first placed on the FATF grey list in 2008, then removed in 2010 after demonstrating progress. However, it was re-listed in 2012, removed again in 2015, and placed back on the grey list in 2018 due to strategic deficiencies in counter-terrorist financing.

In October 2022, Pakistan was removed from the FATF grey list after significant improvements in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Now, Pakistani authorities claim to be developing a “comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets.”

One must question the practicality of this promise, given the country’s shaky track record in financial transparency. Digital currencies, inherently difficult to track, may inadvertently exacerbate the nation’s existing vulnerabilities in money laundering and illicit finance.

A sovereign wallet—or safe haven for questionable funds?

Central to Pakistan’s crypto push is the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet to hold state-controlled digital assets. According to Saqib, this reserve would signify Pakistan’s confidence in decentralized finance rather than speculation. Yet, skepticism abounds about the potential misuse of this wallet.

The transparency challenges intrinsic to cryptocurrency provoke concerns about the national wallet possibly becoming a repository for illicit funds. Given Pakistan’s existing FATF compliance struggles, critics suggest that without rigorous oversight, the strategic bitcoin reserve could unintentionally attract illicit financial activities.",https://www.firstpost.com/world/the-many-ironies-in-pakistan-launching-a-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-13892886.html,Business

"OPEC+ members could hike July oil production by 411,000 barrels per day: Sources","Oil prices eased on Tuesday as market participants weighed the possibility of an OPEC+ decision to further increase its crude oil output at a meeting later this week.

Eight oil-producing nations of the OPEC+ alliance could hike output by as much as 411,000 barrels per day in July, two OPEC+ delegates told CNBC, continuing a rapid unwinding of voluntary production cuts.

Markets are awaiting a final decision on July production, with the eight countries — heavyweight producers Russia and Saudi Arabia, alongside Algeria, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates — set to review market conditions and iron out their output steps on May 31.

These nations have been carrying out two sets of voluntary production cuts.

One, totaling 1.66 million barrels per day, is in effect until the end of next year. Under the other, the countries trimmed their production by an additional 2.2 million barrels per day until the end of the first quarter. They have since agreed to gradually increase output by a combined 1 million barrels per day over April-June, including 411,000 barrel-per-day hikes in each of this and next month.

The OPEC+ delegates, who commented anonymously given the sensitivity of discussions, told CNBC that a further increase of as much as 411,000 barrels per day in July could be agreed this weekend.

Market attention has increasingly shifted away from the official unanimous quotas of OPEC+ — which the group left unchanged on Thursday — to the unwinding of the eight members' voluntary trims. Crude demand typically picks up during the summer, given higher consumption of jet fuel and gasoline for seasonal travel, along with increases in crude burn to produce electricity for air conditioning in several Middle Eastern countries.

This could lend support to oil prices which have struggled amid broader market uncertainty triggered by U.S. tariffs.

Ice Brent futures with July expiry were trading at $65.31 per barrel at 12:44 p.m. London time, up 0.63% from the Thursday close price. The front-month Nymex WTI contract was at $62.22 per barrel, higher by 0.61% from the previous day's settlement.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/opec-members-could-hike-july-oil-output-by-411000-barrels-per-day.html,Business

Spacex Starship rocket loses control during test flight over Africa,"SpaceX’s Starship rocket launched from Texas on Tuesday but lost control halfway through its flight, failing to meet several key testing objectives and posing new challenges for CEO Elon Musk’s Mars rocket program.

The 400-foot Starship system lifted off from SpaceX’s Starbase launch site, surpassing the altitude of two earlier test attempts that ended in explosions earlier this year. This ninth full test mission marked the first time the upper-stage spacecraft was launched on top of a previously flown booster, demonstrating reusability.

During descent, SpaceX lost contact with the 232-foot lower-stage booster, which crashed into the sea instead of making a planned controlled splashdown. Meanwhile, Starship entered suborbital space but began spinning uncontrollably about 30 minutes into the flight after SpaceX canceled plans to deploy eight mock Starlink satellites due to a mechanism failure.

SpaceX broadcaster Dan Huot said on a company livestream that the mission was not meeting many on-orbit objectives. Musk was scheduled to deliver an update at Starbase on the company’s space exploration plans but had not done so hours after the launch.

Musk posted on X that the rocket experienced a fuel leak in its primary tank, which led to the loss of control. He added that data from the launch would be reviewed and that the next three flights would be scheduled about every three to four weeks.

The recent setbacks come amid SpaceX’s efforts to build a multipurpose rocket capable of carrying large numbers of satellites, supporting lunar missions, and ferrying astronauts to Mars. The company uses a flight-testing approach that involves pushing spacecraft to failure to identify improvements through repeated tests.

Tuesday’s flight was intended to complete nearly a full orbit of Earth, with a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean to test new heat shield tiles and revised flaps designed for re-entry and descent. Instead, the rocket broke apart over southern Africa.

Federal regulators had approved the launch four days prior, following a mishap investigation that grounded Starship for nearly two months. Two earlier test flights this year ended in explosions shortly after liftoff, scattering debris over Caribbean islands and disrupting airline flights.

The Federal Aviation Administration expanded debris hazard zones for Tuesday’s launch. The previous failures occurred during early flight phases that SpaceX had cleared in earlier tests, marking a setback for Musk’s accelerated development schedule.

Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002, has indicated that he plans to refocus on his business ventures, including SpaceX, after recent political activities. The Starship rocket is expected to replace SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket in the company’s commercial launch business, which currently carries most of the world’s satellites to orbit.

NASA plans to use Starship for crewed lunar landings as part of its 2027 moon mission, though the program faces challenges amid Musk’s influence and U.S. policy shifts.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/28/spacex-starship-rocket-loses-control-during-test-flight-over-africa/,Business

The new iteration came to the market with a 1.5-liter turbo gasoline engine with either a 6-speed manual, a seven-speed DCT automatic and 169 horsepower, or a plug-in hybrid version with a 24.7 kWh battery for an electric-only range of 75 miles. Now, at home in UK, there are more choices across the popular MG HS SUV's range with new SE and Trophy versions plus the introduction of HS Hybrid+ models.

MG Motor UK introduces the HS Hybrid+ SE and HS Hybrid+ Trophy starting from £28,995 OTR and £31,495 OTR, respectively, both with a 7-year/80,000 miles MG warranty. The MG Hybrid+ powertrain includes a 1.5T gasoline engine with 105 kW and a 146-kW electric motor plus a 1.8 kWh battery pack. Combined power is 165 kW or 221 horsepower, and the MG HS Hybrid+ sprints to 62 mph in 7.9 seconds while also achieving 51.3 MPG (WLTP combined).

""The Hybrid+ will be a great addition to our best-selling MG HS family, blending performance and SUV practicality with a super-efficient hybrid powertrain that keeps running costs down. Just like our recently introduced MG3 and MG ZS Hybrid+ models, we're confident it will prove to be an extremely popular choice for both our existing and new customers alike,"" says David Allison, Head of Product and Pricing at MG Motor UK.

Over in the Land Down Under, MG Motor Australia also introduced a novelty to the MG HS range – the Super Hybrid, with first deliveries pegged for September. The technology is ""designed specifically for Australian conditions"" and combines the 1.5-liter turbo mill and electric motor with a generous 24.7 kWh battery pack for fuel efficiency of fewer than 5 liters per 100 km in real-world driving conditions.

The new MG HS Super Hybrid models will have Excite and Essence trim levels, starting from AUD 52,990 and 55,990, driveaway, respectively. Additionally, the company promises an NEDC range of 135 km for electric driving with a total range of up to 1,000 km. MG Australia's internal testing included driving from Sydney to Melbourne with a single tank and charge.

""I'm incredibly proud to introduce MG Super Hybrid to Australia. Since I came up with this idea, our engineering team has worked tirelessly to deliver this leading product. It is designed for Australian motorists, with the conditions we drive in Australia in mind. MG Super Hybrid will deliver the best of both worlds: smooth electric driving combined with an extended range of petrol-powered flexibility,"" explained Peter Ciao, MG Motor Australia's Chief Executive Officer.",https://www.autoevolution.com/news/mg-motor-launches-hybrid-at-home-in-uk-and-super-hybrid-in-australia-for-hs-compact-cuv-252116.html,Business

KP raises concerns over forced cut in local oil and gas production amid rising LNG imports from Qatar,"The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government has voiced serious concerns over the forced reduction of domestic oil and gas production, blaming the ongoing influx of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar is causing significant revenue losses to the province in the form of diminished royalties and windfall levies, according to a news report.

Local exploration and production companies, including Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and MOL, contribute royalties and levies that are now at risk due to reduced output from various KP hydrocarbon fields.

The issue has been raised with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. During a recent meeting, the KP’s special assistant on energy highlighted that the forced reduction not only results in production losses but also threatens the integrity of gas reservoirs, amplifying long-term damage.

The gas supply restrictions have also intensified circular debt challenges faced by exploration companies, as Pakistan relies more heavily on costly LNG imports from Qatar. Meanwhile, power producers have hesitated to procure LNG as per commitments, complicating the situation for Pakistan State Oil (PSO), a primary LNG importer.

Amid falling indigenous production, Attock Refinery Limited (ARL) announced the shutdown of its main crude distillation unit until June 1, which has a capacity of 32,400 barrels per day, citing critically low crude stocks. ARL attributed the shutdown partly to high-pressure issues faced by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), which led to forced curtailment of gas from local fields and disruptions in oil and gas supply.

Industry sources criticised the previous Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government for signing the LNG purchase agreement with Qatar hastily, without an adequate assessment of Pakistan’s gas demand. This move has burdened the energy sector with rising circular debt.

The private sector’s efforts to import LNG have been hindered by bureaucratic and political obstacles, leading to missed opportunities and higher LNG prices that now challenge import feasibility. Pakistan’s two LNG terminals are underutilised, with one operating at partial capacity due to mismanagement.

The KP government has urged the establishment of a mechanism to prevent such forced curtailments in the future, emphasising mutual benefits for both the province and the federal government. Both federal and provincial authorities acknowledged the gravity of the situation, agreeing to resolve the matter through consultations with all relevant stakeholders.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/29/kp-raises-concerns-over-forced-cut-in-local-oil-and-gas-production-amid-rising-lng-imports-from-qatar/,Business
Trading Day: Japan spreads long bond relief,"There will be more back-and-forth in Trump's tariff pronouncements in the weeks ahead, and there is a case to make that each positive turn will deliver diminishing returns for markets. The next big deadline is July 9, when Trump's pause on his reciprocal tariffs with the rest of the world also expires.

There were good reasons to feel bullish: President Trump extending his deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on European Union goods to July 9, relief at the long end of the Japanese Government Bond market, and a spike in U.S. consumer confidence.

Global liquidity returned to more normal levels on Tuesday as UK and U.S. markets re-opened after the long weekend, and investors mostly scooped up whatever they could get their hands on.

* Wall Street has its best day in two weeks, with the S&P500 snapping a four-day losing run to gain 2% and the Nasdaqrising 2.5%. * Every sector on the S&P 500 rises. Consumer cyclicals leadthe way, up 3%, as investors bet on stronger growth. * Japan's 30-year bond yield slides 16 bps, its biggestfall since August 5 last year, one of its largest ever. The40-year yield's 25 bps fall is a record. * The 30-year U.S. Treasury yield slumps 9 bps, its biggestfall since April 4. * The dollar index rises 0.5%, driven by the greenback's1% rise against the yen, its best day in two weeks.

Brussels seeks companies' US spending plans as Trumphails move toward talks

If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.

In my column today I look at how much the dollar may need to fall if the Trump administration is to succeed in making a significant dent in the U.S. trade deficit. More on that below, but first, a roundup of the main market moves.

A tariff reprieve from U.S. President Donald Trump , a surprise bounce in U.S. consumer confidence and a slide in government bond yields sparked a rally across most markets on Tuesday, particularly U.S. assets, with Wall Street, Treasuries and the dollar all outperforming.

Story Continues

Similarly, consumer confidence in the U.S. and elsewhere is liable to be volatile, difficult to predict amid such heightened uncertainty, and susceptible to the tariff headlines of the day.

That said, if Trump's tariffs deliver a one-off price shock and no lasting inflationary pressure beyond that, consumer confidence may continue to improve. Economists at Citi, for example, forecast year-end inflation of 3.2%, not too much higher than the current rate of around 2.5-2.7% and well below some of the gloomier forecasts of 4% or higher.

Perhaps the most interesting market moves of the day came from Japan, where ultra-long JGB yields clocked some of their steepest one-day falls after sources told Reuters the Ministry of Finance may consider trimming issuance of long-dated paper.

These yields had last week spiked to record highs on growing jitters about Tokyo's deteriorating public finances and an alarming drop off in investor demand. Tuesday's rally in JGBs spread to long-dated U.S. bonds, which have also come under heavy selling pressure on concerns about Washington's fiscal indiscipline and drawn weak demand at auction too.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley on Monday recommended going outright long on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds at 1.505%, which was the yield's high that day. But they remain more cautious on the long end, despite Tuesday's rebound.

A more ""lasting solution"" to the recent market turbulence, they argue, will require an increase in Bank of Japan purchases or less supply from the Ministry of Finance. Or both.

Looking ahead to Wednesday, the global session will kick off with an expected interest rate cut in New Zealand, span a 40-year bond auction in Japan and a five-year note sale in the United States, and wrap up with chipmaker Nvidia's quarterly earnings after the Wall Street close.

Historic dollar fall needed to eliminate US trade deficit

If the United States is to significantly reduce or, whisper it, eliminate its trade deficit, the dollar will probably have to weaken a lot. How much is unclear, though, as history shows large dollar declines are rare and have unpredictable consequences for trade.

Reducing the U.S. trade deficit is the key goal of Trump's economic agenda because he believes it reflects decades of other countries ""ripping off"" America to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars annually.

Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, published a paper in November titled ""A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System"" in which he argued that the dollar is ""persistently over-valued"" from a trade perspective. ""Sweeping tariffs and a shift away from strong dollar policy"" could fundamentally reshape the global trade and financial systems.

If a weaker exchange rate is the Trump administration's goal, it is on the right track, with the greenback down nearly 10% this year on the back of growing concerns over Washington's fiscal trajectory and policy credibility, as well as the end of ""U.S. exceptionalism"" and the ""safe haven"" status of Treasuries.

But it is good to remember that a 15% fall in the dollar during Trump's first term had no impact on the trade deficit, which remained between 2.5% and 3.0% of GDP until the pandemic. Making a dent in the U.S. deficit will therefore require a much bigger move.

WEIGHT OF HISTORY

Reducing the trade deficit will be a challenge, eliminating it without a recession, a historic feat. The United States has run a persistent deficit for the past half-century, as insatiable consumer demand has sucked in goods from around the world and voracious appetite for U.S. assets from overseas has kept capital flowing stateside.

The only exception was in the third quarter of 1980, when the U.S. posted a slender trade surplus of 0.2% of GDP, and trade with the rest of the world almost briefly balanced in 1982 and 1991-92.

But these periods all coincided with - or were the result of - sharp slowdowns in U.S. economic activity that ultimately ended in recession. As growth shrank, import demand slumped and the trade gap narrowed.

The dollar only played a significant role in one of them. In 1987, the trade gap was a then-record 3.1% of GDP. But it had almost disappeared by the early 1990s, largely because of the dollar's 50% devaluation from 1985-87, its biggest-ever depreciation.

That three-year decline was accelerated by the Plaza Accord in September 1985, a coordinated response between the world's economic powers to weaken the dollar following its parabolic rise in the first half of the 1980s.

But that does not mean large depreciations always coincide with reductions in the trade deficit.

The dollar's second-largest decline was a 40% fall between 2002 and mid-2008, just before Lehman Brothers collapsed. But the U.S. trade deficit actually widened throughout most of that period, peaking at a record 6% of GDP in 2005. While it had shrunk by more than three percentage points by 2009, that was due more to plunging imports during the Great Recession than the exchange rate.

These two episodes of deep, protracted dollar depreciation stand out because over the past 50 years, the dollar index has only had two other declines exceeding 20%, in 1977-78 and the early 1990s, and a few other slides of 15-20%. None of these had any discernible impact on the U.S. trade balance.

DEFICIT TO 'VANISH'?

The U.S. administration is correct that the dollar is historically strong today by several broad measures. Given that Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent seem intent on rebalancing global trade, pressure on the greenback looks unlikely to lift any time soon.

But how much would the dollar have to fall to whittle away the yawning trade deficit, which last year totaled $918 billion, or 3.1% of GDP?

Hedge fund manager Andreas Steno Larsen reckons a 20%-25% depreciation over the next two years would see the deficit ""vanish,"" while Deutsche Bank's Peter Hooper thinks a 20%-30% depreciation could be enough to ""eventually"" narrow the deficit by about 3% of GDP.

""This means that a significant reversal of the roughly 40% appreciation of the dollar in real (price-adjusted) terms against a broad set of currencies since 2010 could be sufficient to get the current deficit back to a zero balance,"" Hooper wrote last week.

History suggests this may be challenging without a severe economic slowdown. But that's a risk the administration seems prepared to accept.

What could move markets tomorrow?

* Australia CPI inflation (April) * New Zealand interest rate decision * Taiwan GDP (Q1, revised) * India industrial production (April) * Germany unemployment (April) * U.S. 5-year note auction * New York Fed President John Williams speaks at BOJ-hostedconference in Tokyo * Nvidia quarterly earnings after the closing bell

"China, India, Japan, Australia, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia Lead Significant Expansion of Air Connectivity Across Asia-Pacific and Middle East in 2024 : New Update You Need to Know","China, India, Japan, Australia, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia Lead Significant Expansion of Air Connectivity Across Asia-Pacific and Middle East in 2024 : New Update You Need to Know

In 2024, air connectivity across the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions has witnessed a remarkable expansion, driven primarily by the key contributions of China, India, Japan, Australia, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. This surge is fueled by the reopening of borders, growing international travel demand, and strategic investments in airport infrastructure and airline networks. These nations have played a pivotal role in restoring and enhancing flight routes both within the regions and to global destinations, reflecting their commitment to supporting economic growth, tourism revival, and stronger trade ties. Their leadership in expanding air connectivity underscores the dynamic recovery of the aviation industry and the increasing importance of seamless global travel in the post-pandemic world.

Now in its third edition, this comprehensive ranking was developed in collaboration with PwC and offers a detailed, passenger-centric evaluation of airports across Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. The analysis focuses on three main criteria: the breadth and frequency of flight networks, the economic significance of connected destinations, and the overall efficiency and quality of passenger connections.

In 2024, the Asia-Pacific region achieved a significant 13% rise in air connectivity, whereas the Middle East exceeded all forecasts with an impressive 28% growth. Combined, airports across both regions recorded an average connectivity increase of 14%, highlighting the resilience and dynamic recovery of the aviation sector following the pandemic.

Within Asia-Pacific, domestic regional connections have nearly bounced back to pre-COVID levels, trailing by a mere 0.2%. Intercontinental routes from the region also expanded by 4%. The Middle East demonstrated even stronger growth, exceeding pre-pandemic intra-regional connectivity by 18% and intercontinental links by 16%.

Key Insights from the 2024 Report:

Airports across Asia-Pacific and the Middle East experienced a collective 14% rise in average connectivity, signaling a robust recovery throughout the aviation sector.

The resurgence was largely propelled by China’s reopening and the expansion of its flight networks, which significantly contributed to the overall increase.

Approximately 80% of the top 300 airports restored their connectivity levels fully, with major hubs leading due to revived international air travel.

Domestic city pairs saw a slight decline of 1%, pointing to a strategic shift favoring international route development.

Cross-border international city pairs increased by an average of 17%, signaling a vigorous resurgence in global travel.

Intra-Asia-Pacific passenger journeys in 2024 are nearly at the levels recorded in 2019, while travel to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa has surpassed pre-pandemic volumes, largely thanks to major Gulf hubs.

Travel between Asia-Pacific and the Americas remains below 2019 levels.

The Middle East’s passenger traffic rebounded faster than Asia-Pacific’s, with journeys to Africa and Asia-Pacific exceeding 2019 figures; however, traffic to the Americas continues to lag.

Dubai International Airport maintained its position as the premier airport in terms of connectivity across both regions.

Other major airports, including Incheon, Singapore Changi, Shanghai Pudong, and Beijing Capital, showed improved rankings due to enhanced outbound travel and network adjustments.

The report highlights that robust air connectivity is crucial not just for passenger convenience but also as a backbone for global commerce and economic resilience, especially through the cargo capacity carried on passenger flights.

Sustaining this momentum will require ongoing investments in airport facilities and technological advancements. Given the current geopolitical and trade uncertainties, there is a clear need for governments to focus on liberalizing air services, simplifying visa regulations, and establishing transparent slot allocation processes. Furthermore, maintaining essential air links for remote and island communities remains a priority, as air travel often serves as their primary connection to the outside world.

Rise of Airport City Clusters

A new feature in this edition is the introduction of the Airport City Clusters Index, which examines metropolitan regions with multiple major airports. Urban clusters such as Shenzhen–Hong Kong–Macau, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Beijing lead this ranking by offering greater flight frequency and diverse routing options.

Clusters like Beijing and Shenzhen–Hong Kong–Macau have notably enhanced their connectivity by effectively utilizing secondary airports. Meanwhile, cities such as Seoul, Bangkok, and Taipei stand out for their exceptional per capita connectivity, delivering impressive accessibility relative to their population sizes.

Focus on Hub Connectivity

The updated ranking also introduces a Hub Connectivity Index that evaluates airports based on the effectiveness of their transfer operations. Dubai International Airport ranks highest, followed by Shanghai Pudong and Hamad International Airport, reinforcing their status as critical hubs in the global air transport network.

About the Air Connectivity Ranking

Developed with PwC, the ACI Asia-Pacific and Middle East Air Connectivity Ranking offers an all-encompassing analysis of how airports connect travelers to various destinations. It assesses connectivity through three sub-indices: Direct Connectivity, which measures nonstop flight availability and economic impact of destinations; Indirect Connectivity, which accounts for connecting flight options; and Hub Connectivity, which evaluates an airport’s efficiency as a transfer point.

In 2024, China, India, Japan, Australia, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia are driving a major surge in air connectivity across Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, fueled by border reopenings, growing travel demand, and strategic infrastructure investments. Their leadership is key to the region’s dynamic aviation recovery and expanding global networks.

This multifaceted approach provides stakeholders with a thorough, data-driven understanding of airport connectivity, aiding strategic decisions to enhance regional and global air travel networks.

ADNOC Drilling buys into SLB's Oman and Kuwait rig business,"Logos of ADNOC are seen at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan, April 4, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab

DUBAI, May 29 (Reuters) - ADNOC Drilling (ADNOCDRILL.AD) , opens new tab will acquire a 70% stake in oil services firm SLB's (SLB.N) , opens new tab onshore rig business in Oman and Kuwait for up to $112 million, creating a joint venture it seeks to double in the next year, its chief financial officer said on Thursday.

The acquisition, expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, will give ADNOC Drilling - a unit of Abu Dhabi state oil major ADNOC - access to eight operational onshore drilling rigs, six in Oman and two in Kuwait.

Sign up here.

""So we have things in the pipeline that will potentially at least double that existing, initial eight rigs footprint,"" ADNOC Drilling CFO Youssef Salem told Reuters.

ADNOC Drilling will pay $91 million for the stake, with another $21 million payout to SLB linked to business performance, Salem said.

The current oil price and macroeconomic environment ""put pressure on valuations and multiples globally ... and reduces the pool of potential buyers for such assets, generally, and hence presents a competitive advantage, especially for a cash buyer,"" he said.

The transaction will be financed by drawing from a $1 billion revolving loan that ADNOC Drilling has with a group of regional and international banks. The loan matures in the fourth quarter and will be refinanced before then, Salem said.

The deal will mark the first drilling operations outside the United Arab Emirates for the company, apart from a single rig in Jordan.

ADNOC Drilling's focus will be on growing its scale in Oman and Kuwait, through acquisitions as well as tenders, while also evaluating expansion into other markets, Salem said.

‘Uncertainty’ is the watchword among chief economists,"Uncertainty is the defining theme of the global economic environment, according to the World Economic Forum’s latest Chief Economists Outlook ; 82% consider it very high currently, and 56% anticipate easing over the next year.

The growth outlook is divided, with weak prospects in North America, resilience in Asia-Pacific, and cautious optimism in Europe.

Artificial intelligence is expected to drive growth, but 47% anticipate related net job losses.



In May 2025, uncertainty is the defining theme of the outlook for the global economy. Since the beginning of the year, a series of trade-policy shocks has darkened the outlook, and threatens to paralyze economic and commercial decision-making. 87% of respondents in the World Economic Forum’s latest survey of chief economists expect businesses to delay strategic decisions, which would exacerbate recession risks.

The Forum’s survey was conducted in the first half of April, when trade-related uncertainty was particularly high. It finds that the “unanimous view of respondents was that global economic prospects are set to weaken considerably this year, a significantly gloomier outlook compared to the previous survey in November 2024.”

Published three times a year, the Chief Economists Outlook surveys leading chief economists from across industries and international organizations. The latest edition investigates the drivers and impacts of currently exceptional levels of uncertainty, and discusses the compounding effect of an ongoing AI revolution.

“ “Policymakers and business leaders must respond to heightened uncertainty and trade tensions with greater coordination, strategic agility and investment in the growth potential of transformative technologies like artificial intelligence. These steps are essential for navigating today’s economic headwinds and securing long-term resilience and growth.” ” — Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director, World Economic Forum

Global uncertainty is seen as “very high” by 82% of the chief economists. While a narrow majority (56%) expect conditions to improve over the next year, 21% expect uncertainty in a year to be even higher. The report notes that “While the pausing of most planned tariffs has brought significant relief, the post-pause outlook remains uncertain, and the volatility of decision-making has triggered questions about the continuing reliability and predictability of economic policy in the US.”

In early April, at the peak of uncertainty, most chief economists (77%) were anticipating weak or very weak growth through 2025 in the US, alongside high inflation (79%) and a weakening dollar (76%).

By contrast, they were cautiously optimistic about Europe’s prospects for the first time in years, mainly because of expectations of fiscal expansion – notably in Germany. The outlook for China remains muted; the chief economists were divided over whether it will reach its target of 5% GDP growth this year. Optimism remains highest for South Asia, where 33% expect strong or very strong growth this year.

Nearly all the chief economists (97%) place trade policy among the areas of highest uncertainty, followed by monetary policy (49%), and fiscal policy (35%). “In addition to making economic policymaking more challenging in each of these areas, the recent surge in uncertainty also increases the risk of damaging policy coordination missteps both within and between countries,” the report concludes. This uncertainty is expected to weigh on key economic indicators, including trade volumes (70%), GDP growth (68%), and foreign direct investment (62%).

Chief economists cautioned that we're in for a long-term shift. Image: World Economic Forum

The latest Chief Economists Outlook reveals that a strong majority (79%) of surveyed economists view the current geo-economic developments as a significant structural shift for the global economy rather than a temporary disruption. This is a significant increase from 61% as of November 2024, and points to a global economy moving into a new phase of disruption and adaptation to new realities.

“ “You can no longer and should no longer rely on one end market. You need to go out and find new markets. And that creates excitement, that creates new trade deals. I think globalization, far from being dead, is evolving.” ” — Guy Miller, Zurich Insurance

Business as usual is not an option anymore. At the same time, making the right decisions in an environment of exceptional uncertainty has become increasingly difficult.

“The most likely response, highlighted by 100% of the chief economists surveyed, involves reorganizing sourcing and logistics to reduce exposure to tariffs or export controls over the next three years,” the report notes. A large majority of chief economists (87%) also expect that businesses will respond to uncertainty by delaying strategic decisions, increasing recession risks. The report concludes that “the complexity of the current environment means that businesses will need to balance proactive adaptation with the risk of overextending resources or delaying critical decisions.”

Companies are under pressure to operate under extraordinary uncertainty. Image: World Economic Forum

In addition to geopolitical and economic shifts, the extraordinary speed of the AI revolution is another source of short-term uncertainty – as well as longer-term structural shifts in the global economy. AI is poised to drive the next wave of economic transformation, unlocking significant growth potential but also introducing serious risks.

Although only 45% of chief economists expect AI to become commercially disruptive this year, a similar share (46%) expect AI to deliver a modest boost to global real GDP of between zero and five percentage points over the next decade, with a further 35% projecting gains of between five and 10 points. While the technology has the potential to nudge global growth up from its current sluggish trajectory, its broader impact on aggregate employment remains uncertain. 47% expect net job losses over the next decade, compared to just 19% who expect gains.

Summary

Companies India imposes new software, hardware testing rules for all CCTVs

Firms say they face disruption due to high scrutiny, slow approvals

India worried about Chinese spying via CCTVs, govt official says

Industry warns of impact amid soaring demand for security cameras

NEW DELHI, May 28 (Reuters) - Global makers of surveillance gear have clashed with Indian regulators in recent weeks over contentious new security rules that require manufacturers of CCTV cameras to submit hardware, software and source code for assessment in government labs, official documents and company emails show.

The security-testing policy has sparked industry warnings of supply disruptions and added to a string of disputes between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration and foreign companies over regulatory issues and what some perceive as protectionism.

Sign up here.

New Delhi's approach is driven in part by its alarm about China's sophisticated surveillance capabilities, according to a top Indian official involved in the policymaking. In 2021, Modi's then-junior IT minister told parliament that 1 million cameras in government institutions were from Chinese companies and there were vulnerabilities with video data transferred to servers abroad.

""There's always an espionage risk,"" Gulshan Rai, India's cybersecurity chief from 2015 to 2019, told Reuters. ""Anyone can operate and control internet-connected CCTV cameras sitting in an adverse location. They need to be robust and secure.""

Indian officials met on April 3 with executives of 17 foreign and domestic makers of surveillance gear, including Hanwha, Motorola, Bosch, Honeywell and Xiaomi, where many of the manufacturers said they weren't ready to meet the certification rules and lobbied unsuccessfully for a delay, according to the official minutes.

In rejecting the request, the government said India's policy ""addresses a genuine security issue"" and must be enforced, the minutes show.

India said in December the CCTV rules, which do not single out any country by name, aimed to ""enhance the quality and cybersecurity of surveillance systems in the country.""

This report is based on a Reuters review of dozens of documents, including records of meetings and emails between manufacturers and Indian IT ministry officials, and interviews with six people familiar with India's drive to scrutinize the technology. The interactions haven't been previously reported.

Insufficient testing capacity, drawn-out factory inspections and government scrutiny of sensitive source code were among key issues camera makers said had delayed approvals and risked disrupting unspecified infrastructure and commercial projects.

""Millions of dollars will be lost from the industry, sending tremors through the market,"" Ajay Dubey, Hanwha's director for South Asia, told India's IT ministry in an email on April 9.

The IT ministry and most of the companies identified by Reuters didn't respond to requests for comment about the discussions and the impact of the testing policy. The ministry told the executives on April 3 that it may consider accrediting more testing labs.

Millions of CCTV cameras have been installed across Indian cities, offices and residential complexes in recent years to enhance security monitoring. New Delhi has more than 250,000 cameras, according to official data, mostly mounted on poles in key locations.

The rapid take-up is set to bolster India's surveillance camera market to $7 billion by 2030, from $3.5 billion last year, Counterpoint Research analyst Varun Gupta told Reuters.

China's Hikvision and Dahua account for 30% of the market, while India's CP Plus has a 48% share, Gupta said, adding that some 80% of all CCTV components are from China.

Hanwha, Motorola Solutions and Britain's Norden Communication told officials by email in April that just a fraction of the industry's 6,000 camera models had approvals under the new rules.

CHINA CONCERN

The U.S. in 2022 banned sales of Hikvision and Dahua equipment, citing national security risks. Britain and Australia have also restricted China-made devices.

Likewise, with CCTV cameras, India ""has to ensure there are checks on what is used in these devices, what chips are going in,"" the senior Indian official told Reuters. ""China is part of the concern.""

China's state security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence work.

Reuters reported this month that unexplained communications equipment had been found in some Chinese solar power inverters by U.S. experts who examined the products.

Since 2020, when Indian and Chinese forces clashed at their border, India has banned dozens of Chinese-owned apps , including TikTok, on national security grounds. India also tightened foreign investment rules for countries with which it shares a land border.

The remote detonation of pagers in Lebanon last year, which Reuters reported was executed by Israeli operatives targeting Hezbollah, further galvanized Indian concerns about the potential abuse of tech devices and the need to quickly enforce testing of CCTV equipment, the senior Indian official said.

The camera-testing rules don't contain a clause about land borders.

But last month, China's Xiaomi said that when it applied for testing of CCTV devices, Indian officials told the company the assessment couldn't proceed because ""internal guidelines"" required Xiaomi to supply more registration details of two of its China-based contract manufacturers.

""The testing lab indicated that this requirement applies to applications originating from countries that share a land border with India,"" the company wrote in an April 24 email to the Indian agency that oversees lab testing.

Xiaomi didn't respond to Reuters queries, and the IT ministry didn't address questions about the company's account.

China's foreign ministry told Reuters it opposes the ""generalization of the concept of national security to smear and suppress Chinese companies,"" and hoped India would provide a non-discriminatory environment for Chinese firms.

LAB TESTING, FACTORY VISITS

While CCTV equipment supplied to India's government has had to undergo testing since June 2024, the widening of the rules to all devices has raised the stakes.

The public sector accounts for 27% of CCTV demand in India, and enterprise clients, industry, hospitality firms and homes the remaining 73%, according to Counterpoint.

The rules require CCTV cameras to have tamper-proof enclosures, strong malware detection and encryption.

Companies need to run software tools to test source code and provide reports to government labs, two camera industry executives said.

The rules allow labs to ask for source code if companies are using proprietary communication protocols in devices, rather than standard ones like Wi-Fi. They also enable Indian officials to visit device makers abroad and inspect facilities for cyber vulnerabilities.

The Indian unit of China's Infinova (002528.SZ) , opens new tab told IT ministry officials last month the requirements were creating challenges.

""Expectations such as source code sharing, retesting post firmware upgrades, and multiple factory audits significantly impact internal timelines,"" Infinova sales executive Sumeet Chanana said in an email on April 10. Infinova didn't respond to Reuters questions.

The same day, Sanjeev Gulati, India director for Taiwan-based Vivotek (3454.TW) , opens new tab , warned Indian officials that ""All ongoing projects will go on halt."" He told Reuters this month that Vivotek had submitted product applications and hoped ""to get clearance soon.""

The body that examines surveillance gear is India's Standardization Testing and Quality Certification Directorate, which comes under the IT ministry. The agency has 15 labs that can review 28 applications concurrently, according to data on its website that was removed after Reuters sent questions. Each application can include up to 10 models.

As of May 28, 342 applications for hundreds of models from various manufacturers were pending, official data showed. Of those, 237 were classified as new, with 142 lodged since the April 9 deadline.

Testing had been completed on 35 of those applications, including just one from a foreign company.

India's CP Plus told Reuters it had received clearance for its flagship cameras but several more models were awaiting certification.

Bosch said it too had submitted devices for testing, but asked that Indian authorities ""allow business continuity"" for those products until the process is completed.

When Reuters visited New Delhi's bustling Nehru Place electronics market last week, shelves were stacked with popular CCTV cameras from Hikvision, Dahua and CP Plus.

But Sagar Sharma said revenue at his CCTV retail shop had plunged about 50% this month from April because of the slow pace of government approvals for security cameras.

""It is not possible right now to cater to big orders,"" he said. ""We have to survive with the stock we have.""

"Elon Musk says he's back to sleeping at work, and Tesla investors are thrilled","This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The move: Tesla CEO Elon Musk is all about working at his companies again after his stint in government, and it's music to investors' ears.

Tesla shares are up 7% since last Friday, trading at about $362 a share. The stock, which plunged nearly 50% from its late-2024 peak earlier this year, is up 65% from its April low.

Why: Musk reaffirmed his commitment to his companies in a post on X over the weekend.

""Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,"" Musk said in a post on his social media platform. ""I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.""

What it means: The comments have bolstered investors' confidence in Tesla. Shareholders have raised concerns about Musk not spending enough time working at his car company in recent years, particularly after he took up a role in the DOGE office.

But sentiment has improved since Musk promised to step back from his gig in the White House starting in May.

Musk has been known to sleep in the office and has preached the virtues of working long hours in person over remote work.

In 2022, he spoke about sleeping on Tesla's factory floors when appearing at an investment conference in New York. After acquiring Twitter, which he later rebranded as X, Musk said he occasionally slept on the couches in Twitter's San Francisco HQ, and even turned some office spaces into bedrooms for workers.

Musk's reengagement with his company is coming at a critical time for Tesla. The stock nosedived more than 50% from its highs late last year through early April, thanks to declining sales, concerns about the impact of tariffs, and investor dissatisfaction with how much time Musk was spending away from the company.

The EV maker is getting ready to launch its robotaxi business this summer, and Wall Street is anticipating Tesla to soon roll out a more affordable vehicle, which Musk has teased for years.",https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-price-tsla-elon-musk-sleeping-at-work-rally-2025-5,Business
Saudi Arabia set to lower July oil prices for Asia,"Saudi Arabia is set to reduce its July crude oil prices for Asia to a six-month low, mirroring declines in benchmark prices due to an uptick in supply from OPEC+.

The anticipated drop for Arab Light crude could range from $0.40–0.50, setting the price at $0.90–$1 per barrel (bbl) lower than the previous month, according to a Reuters survey of four Asian refining sources.

This potential reduction would mark the lowest price point for Arab Light crude since January, as indicated by Reuters data.

Saudi crude official selling prices (OSPs) are typically announced around the fifth of each month and influence pricing for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil, affecting around nine million barrels per day (bpd) destined for Asia.

The survey also suggests that July OSPs for other Saudi grades such as Arab Extra Light, Arab Medium and Arab Heavy crude are expected to fall by $0.30-0.45/bbl from June.

The decline in oil prices follows OPEC+, which includes the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, agreeing to boost production by nearly one million barrels per day (1mbbl/d) across April, May and June.

In an upcoming meeting, eight OPEC+ countries may consider a further output increase of 411,000bpd for July, as per sources.

These supply hikes come amid global economic challenges including a tariff war initiated by the US.

Middle Eastern benchmarks have been pressured by the rising supplies, with the average cash Dubai premium to swaps at $1.21/bbl as of 27 May, a $0.45 decrease from April's average.

Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, bases its crude prices on customer recommendations and the past month's oil value changes, considering yields and product prices.

The PRA’s updated supervisory expectations for managing climate-related risks: what this means for banks and insurers,"For a long time, both the PRA and FCA have recognised that climate change is a potential material financial risk to regulated firms. On 30 April 2025, the PRA published a consultation paper (CP10/25) setting out proposed updates to its supervisory expectations regarding banks’ and insurers’ approaches to managing climate-related risks, together with a draft supervisory statement updating SS3/19.

The PRA’s view is that since SS3/19 was published in 2019, banks and insurers have taken concrete and positive steps to improve their climate risk management capabilities, but progress is uneven and more needs to be done to meet the PRA’s expectations. Firms have also asked the PRA to provide more clarity on its expectations.

As David Bailey, the PRA’s Executive Director for Prudential Policy, emphasised in a speech at the Climate Financial Risk Forum on 30 April 2025, these are expectations, not rules. Furthermore, they are enhancements to the expectations set out in SS3/19 rather than a change of direction in the PRA’s approach to climate risk. They consolidate existing guidance and reflect developments in international standards. Nevertheless, they are likely to impose additional burdens and compliance costs on firms, though these should be more limited for firms that have been keeping up to date with developments.

Climate-related risks

The consultation paper explains that climate-related risks affect banks and insurers through two main channels: physical risks and transition risks. For banks, both risk types can impact their lending and investment portfolios. For insurers, physical risk can damage their assets or properties, resulting in lower asset values or increased claims, and is particularly relevant to general insurers, while transition risk can manifest through lower insurance premiums from carbon-intensive sectors or repricing of carbon-intensive assets, with the biggest impact on life insurers.

The PRA notes that these risks are systemic; while both types of risks are foreseeable, they are also uncertain in both scale and timing. However, the magnitude and distribution of the future risks will be determined by the actions that banks and insurers take now, before it is too late.

Supervisory feedback on climate-related risk management

Following the publication of SS3/19, the PRA said in a Dear CEO letter that it expected firms to have embedded their approaches to managing climate-related financial risks by the end of 2021. It set out some examples of good practice as well as gaps between firms’ intentions and its expectations. It followed this up with subsequent Dear CEO letters in 2022 and 2024 in which it observed that firms were making progress, but there was still work to do. The PRA has also published Dear CFO letters with thematic findings on accounting capabilities for climate risks, which set out the PRA’s views on ways that firms can develop their capabilities to capture the impact of climate-related risks on balance sheets over time, consistent with SS3/19.

In the consultation paper, the PRA notes that most banks have still not established climate-related risk metrics or defined a climate-specific risk appetite. Although many banks have started trying to manage the reputational risk associated with financing carbon emissions, they are failing to adequately assess their exposure to other climate-related risks. Firms have yet to fully operationalise scenario analyses, and none is currently able to design scenarios that fit their business case. Where firms have started to do scenario analysis, they are usually qualitative or based on expert judgment, whereas a quantitative approach would be more effective.

In the insurance sector, the PRA says that while most insurers include some climate-related risks within their risk-appetite statement, their risk management processes are still at an early stage of development. Insurers are unable to measure and monitor climate exposures against their risk appetite, and those who see climate-related risk as a driver of existing risk rather than a standalone risk evidence little or no climate-related risk appetite statement or threshold. While most insurers run several climate scenarios, results are not being used in decision-making. The PRA has also found that some insurers have gaps in their capabilities, data and tools, which means that scenarios do not reflect the full range of risks to which they are exposed.

The PRA’s proposals

The consultation paper consolidates the guidance set out in the Dear CEO and Dear CFO letters noted above, as well as other guidance that the PRA has issued to date. It also reflects improvements in the understanding of climate-related risks as well as the development of international standards since 2019.

The PRA acknowledges that firms may need to take additional actions to comply with the updated expectations. However, it expects the framework to be applied proportionately. Firms will need to take the following two steps to determine how best to manage climate-related risks:

First, firms should identify the climate-related risks they are exposed to and assess how these risks could impact their business model over appropriate time horizons and under different climate scenarios. This process should be supported by relevant scenario analysis.

Second, firms should develop a risk management response that is proportionate to their vulnerability to climate-related risk. Firms with more material exposures will need to take greater action.

Firms should be prepared to evidence and explain how they reached the judgments underpinning the outcomes arising from these two steps.

In light of the more detailed expectations, the PRA is proposing to structure the revised supervisory statement into seven chapters, rather than the current four:

Governance: The PRA proposes to add detail and clarity to the existing expectations to help firms make further progress in establishing appropriate governance structures for climate-related risks. This includes new expectations to ensure that a firm’s strategy is consistent with its climate targets, as well as establishing the internal controls environment. The PRA also provides more detail on the corporate governance structures needed to manage climate-related risks.

Risk management: The PRA proposes to introduce clearer expectations regarding each element of the risk management framework and clarify how existing PRA policies related to risk management generally should be applied to climate-related risks. The PRA expects firms to use a structured approach to develop metrics and limits to monitor and manage these risks. The proposals also seek to ensure that the management body receives appropriate risk reporting.

Summary Weekly jobless claims increase 14,000 to 240,000

Continuing claims rise 26,000 to 1.919 million

Corporate profits fall $118.1 billion in first quarter

Economy contracts at 0.2% rate in Q1 by all measures

WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits increased more than expected last week and the unemployment rate appeared to have picked up in May, suggesting layoffs were rising as tariffs cloud the economic outlook.

The report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed a surge in applications in Michigan last week, the nation's motor vehicle assembly hub. The number of people collecting unemployment checks in mid-May was the largest in 3-1/2 years. The outlook for the economy is dimming with other data showing a sharp decline in corporate profits in the first quarter.

A U.S. trade court on Wednesday blocked most of Trump's tariffs from going into effect in a sweeping ruling that the president overstepped his authority. Economists said the ruling, while it offered some relief, had added another layer of uncertainty over the economy.

""This is a sign that cracks are starting to form in the economy and that the outlook is deteriorating,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. ""There is nothing great about today's jobless claims data and the jump in layoffs may be a harbinger of worse things to come.""

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 240,000 for the week ended May 24, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 230,000 claims for the latest week.

Initial jobless claims

Unadjusted claims increased 10,742 to 212,506 last week, lifted by a 3,329 jump in filings in Michigan. There were also notable increases in applications in Nebraska and California.

Despite the rise in claims, worker hoarding by employers following difficulties finding labor during and after the COVID-19 pandemic continues to underpin the jobs market.

Nonetheless, there has been an uptick in layoffs because of economic uncertainty as Trump 's aggressive trade policy makes it challenging for businesses to plan ahead.

A report from the Bank of America Institute noted a sharp rise in higher-income households receiving unemployment benefits between February and April compared to the same period last year. Its analysis of Bank of America deposit accounts also showed notable rises among lower-income as well as middle-income households in April from the same period a year ago.

Economists expect claims in June to break above their 205,000-243,000 range for this year, mostly driven by difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations, following a similar pattern in recent years.

Minutes of the Federal Reserve's May 6-7 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed while policymakers continued to view labor market conditions as broadly in balance, they ""assessed that there was a risk that the labor market would weaken in coming months.""

They noted that there was ""considerable uncertainty"" over the job market's outlook, adding ""outcomes would depend importantly on the evolution of trade policy as well as other government policies.""

The U.S. central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range since December as officials struggle to estimate the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have raised the prospect of higher inflation and slower economic growth this year.

U.S. stocks opened higher. The dollar eased against a basket of currencies after a brief rally. U.S. Treasury yields fell.

SWELLING UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS

The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.919 million during the week ending May 17, the claims report showed. The elevated so-called continuing claims reflect companies' hesitance to increase headcount because of the economic uncertainty.

Continuing jobless claims

Continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for May's unemployment rate. They increased between the April and May survey periods, suggesting an uptick in the unemployment rate this month. The jobless rate was at 4.2% in April.

Many people who have lost their jobs are experiencing long spells of unemployment. The median duration of unemployment jumped to 10.4 weeks in April from 9.8 weeks in March.

With profits under pressure, there is probably little incentive for businesses to boost hiring. Mass layoffs are, however, unlikely with a Conference Board survey of chief executive officers released on Thursday showing most captains of business anticipated no change in the size of their workforce over the next year even as about 83% said they expected a recession in the next 12-18 months.

Profits from current production with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments dropped $118.1 billion in the first quarter, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said in a separate report. Profits surged $204.7 billion in the October-December quarter.

Companies ranging from airlines and retailers to motor vehicle manufacturers have either withdrawn or refrained from giving financial guidance for 2025, citing the uncertainty caused by the on-again and off-again nature of some duties.

Businesses front-loaded imports and households engaged in pre-emptive buying of goods last quarter to avoid higher costs, making it difficult to get a clear picture of the economy.

The deluge of imports sent gross domestic product declining at a 0.2% annualized rate in the January-March quarter, the BEA said in its second estimate of GDP. The economy was initially estimated to have contracted at a 0.3% pace. It grew at a 2.4% rate in the fourth quarter.

A column chart titled ""US gross domestic product"" that tracks the metric over the last year.

Other alternative measures of growth, gross domestic income and gross domestic output also showed the economy contracting at a 0.2% pace in the first quarter.

Summary

Companies Syndicated loan market slowed due to volatility over tariffs

Private credit players offer flexible terms for loans vs banks

Lakeview Farms chose private credit over banks for its loan

Apollo, Blackstone partly funded Thoma Bravo deal -sources

NEW YORK, May 29 (Reuters) - Tariff uncertainty and market volatility have sent some companies looking for a flexible, more certain route to funding from private credit firms, resulting in the spurning of traditional lenders in some cases.

A number of companies have selected loans from private credit providers over traditional forms of credit since the beginning of April when back-and-forth policy over tariffs created market choppiness. Analysts and bankers forecast that private credit, a $2 trillion industry that has grown from $500 million a decade ago, benefited from the volatility.

Sign up here.

""When you have volatility, it becomes relatively harder for the banks to place new deals into the syndicated loan market,"" said Mike Koester, a former Goldman Sachs executive who co-founded 5C Investment Partners, a private credit investing firm.

""And that is when private credit takes more share because it already has the capital and it can lend directly where it is required.""

Recent examples have been Lakeview Farms, which sought to fund its $200 million buyout of yogurt-maker Noosa in April. Lakeview chose to obtain a loan from private credit firm Silver Point Capital because it offered more flexible financing than traditional lenders like banks via the syndicated loan process, two sources told Reuters. Citigroup (C.N) , opens new tab was initially leading the loan talks, one of the sources said.

Citi declined to comment. Lakeview did not respond to a Reuters query for comment.

""At the moment, private credit is very competitive,"" said Ted Swimmer, head of capital markets and advisory at Citizens Financial, which sometimes competes with private credit companies. It also lends to them and works with them on deals. ""We were structuring a couple of syndicated loans but we could not price those loans competitively given the market volatility and lost the deals to private credit bids.""

The total number of syndicated loans in the U.S. declined by 15% between January and May 21 versus the same period last year, according to Dealogic, as bankers said volatility in markets slowed public markets.

Direct lending transactions - which directly compete with the syndicated loan market and usually involve a handful of private credit funds - have fallen at a slower pace of 10% in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier, PitchBook's Leveraged Commentary & Data shows.

There has been an increase in direct lending credit deals in April and May, two sources at private credit firms and a banker said.

Private credit may be more expensive than traditional lending, but it offers more flexible terms for structuring a transaction, industry players say.

This can include flexible loan terms, repayment schedules, covenants, and collateral requirements, unlike more standardized underwriting models for banks.

The Lakeview deal, announced on April 8, came at a time when credit spreads for borrowers had widened sharply as financial markets tumbled in the wake of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcements.

""Volatility is often not the friend of the public financing markets,"" Brad Marshall, global head of private credit strategies at Blackstone Credit & Insurance, told Reuters.

""In many cases, it is very much a friend of the private markets because it is more reliable as you're taking a longer-term view.""

INDUSTRY GROWTH

The growth in private credit came after stricter regulations put in place after the 2007-09 financial crisis made it more expensive for banks to finance risky loans to debt-ridden companies.

Direct lenders, often nonbank entities like private equity firms and asset managers such as Apollo, Ares Management (ARES.N) , opens new tab and KKR (KKR.N) , opens new tab , are sometimes seen as a more viable financing option than traditional banks due to their ability to offer more flexible terms and leverage.

More borrowers are turning to private credit, which can provide greater certainty relative to the broadly syndicated markets, said Kort Schnabel, partner and co-head of U.S. Direct Lending at Ares.

""During volatile markets, the value of certainty increases,"" he said. Another key lender, Apollo, did not respond to a request for comment.

Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

""We believe that private credit will accumulate greater market share amidst the volatility,"" said Marc Pinto, Moody’s Ratings global head of private credit. ""They're a bit more agile.""

TOKYO, May 29 (Reuters) - Toyota (7203.T) , opens new tab said on Thursday its worldwide output and sales rose for a fourth consecutive month in April on strong demand for hybrid vehicles and rush buying in the United States over U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs.

The world's biggest automaker's global sales for April increased 10% year-on-year to 876,864 vehicles, with U.S. sales climbing just as much, fuelled by strong demand, including rush-buying over the tariffs, according to Toyota.

Hybrid vehicle sales made up about 44% of Toyota's total worldwide sales for the first four months of the year.

In April, the Japanese company's global vehicle production rose 8% year-on-year to 814,787 vehicles, lifted by higher production in Japan and markets in North America, South America and China.

The production and sales figures include its luxury Lexus brand.

Tech shares climb after strong Nvidia results despite warning over rise of Chinese rivals,"Technology shares climbed on Thursday, buoyed by strong results from Nvidia, despite the AI chip company’s boss issuing a warning about the rise of Chinese rivals.

The Stoxx Europe tech index rose by 0.8% on Thursday following Nvidia’s financial report, with the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML rallying by 2.4%.

In the US, futures for the tech-focused Nasdaq climbed 2%, and shares in Nvidia itself jumped 6% in pre-market trading.

The boost to tech and artificial intelligence stocks came hours after Nvidia beat Wall Street forecasts, with quarterly revenues jumping 69% to $44bn (£32.6bn). The company also said it expected deals in the Middle East to start to fill a gap left by the loss of Chinese business.

In April the US president, Donald Trump, said he was restricting AI chip exports to China, in effect barring Nvidia from selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese companies and blocking a major source of its revenue.

Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, warned that Chinese rivals were benefiting from the void left by US firms forced to abandon the market due to US trade restrictions. “The Chinese competitors have evolved,” Huang told Bloomberg Television. He added that Huawei, which had been blacklisted by the US government, had become “quite formidable”. “Like everybody else, they are doubling, quadrupling capabilities every year,” Huang said. “And the volume is increasing substantially.”

While the US government policy is meant to keep AI technologies out of the hands of Chinese actors, Huang said local companies are simply finding other options. “You cannot underestimate the importance of the China market,” Huang said. “This is the home of the world’s largest population of AI researchers.”

Nvidia said it expects to miss out on $8bn in revenue in the second quarter as a result of Trump’s trade restrictions.

Tech investors were also optimistic after a US trade court ruled against Trump’s sweeping tariffs regime, in a move that could ultimately block the president’s sweeping trade levies. But there is further uncertainty ahead, with the White House having already filed an appeal against the decision, issued by judges from the New York-based court of international trade.

Meanwhile, shares in Tesla, another leader in artificial intelligence technology, rose 2.6%, after the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, confirmed that he would formally leave his role in the Trump administration.

Musk has been leading the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) since January, which ruthlessly cut state spending across a number of public departments and agencies. He said in April he would be stepping back after seeing Tesla’s earnings plunge and failing to win a supreme court race in which he spent millions of dollars supporting a Republican candidate.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/29/tech-shares-climb-after-strong-nvidia-results-despite-warning-over-rise-of-chinese-rivals,Business
Fight to stop Tesla project in South Australia to continue after council approval,"An anonymous group of Adelaide activists will keep fighting to stop Elon Musk’s Tesla from setting up a battery factory in the suburbs.

Tesla has been targeted globally by protesters furious at Musk’s work with the Trump administration, and at his ideology which the billionaire often espouses through his social media platform, X.

This week that anger boiled over in the South Australian capital, half a world away from Washington DC.

About 95% of the nearly 1,000 submissions were opposed to a proposal to build a Tesla showroom and battery recycling and repurposing factory. Many expressed “anti-Tesla and anti-Elon Musk sentiment”.

For decency, the local council redacted the language in some submissions to describe Musk and Tesla.

“We should not support and put money in the pockets of a [redacted] who openly [redacted] salutes, is [redacted] human,” said one.

The world’s richest man has announced he will leave his role in the department of government efficiency, which has slashed jobs and funding for US government agencies with often chaotic and devastating effects. He is pivoting back to his businesses, including Tesla, amid slumping sales.

Meanwhile in Adelaide, the Marion city council overrode community objections and approved the factory project to proceed to the next stage, which will need state government approval. The council said the project would bring in 100 jobs and millions of dollars to the community.

But the protest movement “Trees not Teslas” is determined to fight on.

While conservation groups and others were protesting against the Tesla project because of the need to remove trees on the land where the plant would be built, Trees not Teslas also fired people up over Musk himself.

“Neon” from Trees not Teslas did not want to use his real name, in part for fear of reprisals and in part because the group considers itself a collective.

He said the traction the group got was “wild”, with their website getting thousands of views, but he acknowledged it was impossible to work out how much influence they ultimately had.

Neon said the fight will continue, as the state government considers whether to approve the council’s proposal to revoke the site’s status as community land.

“We just move that further up. We have to. We move that into actions for the state government,” Neon said.

“We spread more awareness. We try to get more people involved. It now becomes not just a council issue but a fundamental state issue.”

He said they started the campaign primarily to protect the trees on the site. “… our main focus was the trees … we’re looking to preserve green spaces,” he said.

“We’re very pro-electric vehicle and pro-green energy.

“But the industry that destroys green spaces is … green in name only.”

The council argued that the space had not been publicly accessible since 2016 because of contamination. Neon said trees can help remediate the land.

He also echoed comments made by the councillor Sarah Lascombe, who voted against the proposal, that the factory would only recycle or repurpose Tesla batteries, when most people use other brands.

While the discussion has centred around electric vehicle batteries, it is possible the site could also recycle and repurpose Powerwall batteries.

Guardian Australia has contacted Tesla for comment.

Neon said the council voting eight to three to seek state government approval despite the community objections made the public consultation process seem like a box-ticking exercise.

The mayor, Kris Hanna, said the project would bring jobs and an income stream into the community, and that Tesla would just set up elsewhere, if not in Marion. Tesla, Hanna said, had pledged to retain most significant trees and replace more trees than it was required to.

Neon said the established trees would be replaced with saplings, removing many of their benefits.

The state premier, Peter Malinauskas, said earlier this week that major industrial developments were welcome in the state and that while he “violently” disagreed with Musk’s politics, they were “his prerogative”.

A state government spokesperson said the government welcomed investment and job creation in SA and would consider the proposal.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/30/fight-to-stop-musk-tesla-project-adelaide-australia-ntwnfb,Business

A cheap and easy potential solution for lowering carbon emissions in maritime shipping,"Adopting new digital systems to help oceangoing container ships get in line to offload their cargo at busy ports appears to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 16-24%, according to researchers at UC Santa Barbara. Not only would this relatively simple intervention reduce emissions, but the technology to implement these measures already exists and is cheap.

“Arguably the most impactful thing we can do to slow climate change is to directly cut CO 2 emissions,” said Rachel Rhodes, a project scientist at the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory (BOSL) at UCSB, and lead author of a paper that appears in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin. “This has scientists looking at all sectors for places to trim.”

One promising candidate for CO 2 reduction is the maritime shipping industry, which contributes about 3% of the world’s total greenhouse gases — on par with emissions from aviation — an amount that is forecasted to grow as globalization increases. Typically, these vessels race across the ocean and then line up and idle at ports as they wait to be unloaded.

“Many ports worldwide still use the century-old ‘first come, first-served’ system for ship berthing, that reminds me of when you pull a ticket from those red ‘take a number’ machines when you visit the Department of Motor Vehicles,” said Douglas McCauley, a UCSB marine ecologist and director of the BOSL. In normal times at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, this system typically results in a backlog of 0-4 container vessels waiting to be unloaded. During disruptions, such as the delays brought by the COVID pandemic, the inefficiency can increase to around 100 container vessels just idling near the port.

During the pandemic, marine industry stakeholders came together to quickly design and implement a new electronic queueing system primarily to prevent such congestion. Herein lies the potential low-hanging fruit.

“Instead of using the old approach, container ships get a spot in line based on when they left their previous port,” said Rhodes. “Think of it like making a reservation at a popular restaurant before you leave home, rather than racing across town, hoping to beat others to the door.” With their place in line secure, vessels delivering cargo to Los Angeles/Long Beach don’t have to rush during their trans-Pacific voyage. In theory, these slower ships would burn less fuel and create fewer emissions.",https://news.ucsb.edu/2025/021895/cheap-and-easy-potential-solution-lowering-carbon-emissions-maritime-shipping,Business

New IAEA Project to Enhance Water Forecasting,"Unlike conventional hydrological models, isotope-enabled models can simulate and track how different forms of water move and change throughout the water cycle. As a result, isotope-enabled hydrological models are more robust than conventional models as they use precipitation data to simulate both surface and baseflows as well as stream or groundwater isotopes. But isotope-enabled models suffer from a lack of available data. The models typically require several years of continuous data for precipitation, as the primary water input source, but despite ongoing precipitation collection efforts, records are not always continuous.

New developments in isotope-enabled climate models have shown potential for improved weather forecasts and the simulation of precipitation isotope inputs for hydrological modelling. But some elements of the data outputs are not as robust as they could be, and the higher data requirements of isotope-enabled models mean they have not yet been used in forecasting systems. By combining freely available existing weather forecasts and climate predictions with isotope-enabled hydrological and climate models could provide a means of further reducing forecasting uncertainty. This will help member countries generate more robust models and adaptation strategies to address the impact of extreme weather events like floods and droughts.",https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/new-iaea-project-to-enhance-water-forecasting,Business
"Fed's Goolsbee: if tariffs are avoided, policy rate can come down","Austan Goolsbee, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, speaks to the Economic Club of New York in New York City, U.S., April 10, 2025.

May 29 (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee on Thursday said he believes that if big tariffs could be avoided, either through trade deals or otherwise, the central bank could likely cut interest rates, given the underlying strength of the economy and the direction of inflation.

Goolsbee did not comment directly on a ruling Wednesday by a US trade court that blocked many of the tariffs put on by the Trump administration, including the aggressive ""Liberation Day"" levies from April 2. Before that date, Goolsbee said, the labor market was stable and inflation was heading towards the Fed's 2% goal, conditions that would allow the Fed to bring the policy rate down to its long-term settling point, well below the current 4.25%-4.5% rate.

Water treatment projects among winners of £42m round of funding from regulator,"PILOT projects to improve water treatment were among the biggest winners in the latest round of a funding competition led by regulator Ofwat.

The regulator announced the 16 winners of its fifth Water Breakthrough Challenge last week, allocating a total of £42m (US$56.7m) to company proposals to improve water systems in England and Wales.

The biggest winner was a project led by Severn Trent Water that won £9.8m to trial converting sludge extracted during wastewater treatment into feedstocks for biofuels. Other partners on the project include researchers from Durham University and consultants at Jacobs and Hybrid Gasification.

A similar project led by United Utilities won £5.1m to generate biogas from the breakdown of organic matter during wastewater treatment. United Utilities says that the biogas would then fuel power generation for the treatment process. The project will also involve researchers from Imperial College London and Cranfield University as well as consultants from Jacobs.

Other funding allocations for treatment-related projects include £2m to Northumbrian Water that will use industrial waste heat to drive forward osmosis; £1.9m for Severn Trent to develop microwave-based technology for PFAS removal from drinking water; and £1.4m to a joint project between United Utilities, Northumbrian Water and Anglian Water for rapid gene sequencing to identify specific microbes in wastewater treatment.

The Water Breakthrough Challenge is part of the regulator’s “innovation fund”, launched in 2020 with the promise to invest £600m by 2030 in pilot projects that could help improve all aspects of water infrastructure in England and Wales. Each winning project is required to top up Ofwat’s grant with an additional investment of at least 10%.

While the fund is intended to support improvements across both England and Wales, all 16 winning projects in the latest round were led by water companies serving English regions only.

Ofwat CEO David Black said: “Water underpins our society and economy, and the water sector faces a range of challenges requiring urgent solutions.

“The Ofwat Innovation Fund was established five years ago to incentivise the water sector to collaborate with partners across industry, charities, and academia to accelerate the pace of transformation and create lasting benefits for customers and the environment.

“The level of ambition of this year’s winners is remarkable. We are supporting these projects to prove their impact so that they can be scaled, not only here in England and Wales, but exported around the world as a driver economic growth.”

Trouble on the Thames

Ten of the 16 water companies operating in England and Wales are involved in projects that won Ofwat funding. This includes the beleaguered Thames Water, which is leading a £2m project to improve the efficiency of sand-based water filtration.

Thames, the UK’s biggest water company serving around a quarter of the country’s population, was issued a fine by Ofwat of £122.7m – the biggest in the regulator’s history – this week, for discharging raw sewage “routinely” and for making “undeserved” payouts to shareholders, including a £131.3m dividend last March.

Meanwhile, Southern Water and South East Water both won no Ofwat funding. Southern, owned by a consortium of investment funds including JP Morgan and UBS banks, were previous record holders for the largest ever Environment Agency fine, ordered in 2021 to pay the regulator £90m for discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea.

The other companies not included in winning projects were non-profit Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water and local water-only companies SES Water and Portsmouth Water. Mid-Wales-serving Hafren Dyfrdwy did not win any funding, although its parent Severn Trent was involved in four winning projects.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/news/water-treatment-projects-among-winners-of-42m-round-of-funding-from-regulator/,Business
New Insights into Bladder Cancer Treatment Could Help Improve Immunotherapies,"More than three decades ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) as the first immunotherapy against cancer. And it is still used today to treat early-stage bladder cancer.

Now, a team of researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) is expanding the understanding of how the treatment works — an understanding that could help improve the effectiveness of immunotherapies more broadly.

Dr. Michael Glickman

BCG is a weakened strain of the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis, which is used worldwide as a vaccine against childhood tuberculosis. In the treatment bladder cancer, BCG is used in higher concentrations, and the assumption has long been that it works primarily by infecting local cancer cells thereby drawing the attention of the patient’s immune cells to come and attack the tumor — though exactly how it works hasn’t been entirely clear. Scientists weren’t sure the extent to which the immune response that eliminates the cancer is directed against the bacteria versus the tumor.

“It's an example of a therapy that was proven to be clinically effective before we fully understood all the underlying mechanisms,” said physician-scientist Dr. Michael Glickman, acting director of the Marie-Josée Kravis Center for Cancer Immunobiology at MSK and a professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.

Dr. Steven Josefowicz

In a new study, published May 29 in Cancer Cell, Dr. Glickman and his colleagues showed BCG doesn’t just work locally in the bladder, but reprograms and amplifies cells in the bone marrow that give rise to a class of immune cells called myeloid cells — boosting the immune system’s ability to fight cancer more generally.

“BCG therapy has been one of the most successful immunotherapies for cancer,” added Dr. Steven Josefowicz, an associate professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-senior author of the study, along with Dr. Glickman. “And now it’s clear it improves the innate immune system’s ability to fight cancer.”

The “innate” immune system offers rapid, general defenses against new threats, whereas the “adaptive” immune system prepares responses tailored to threats it has previously encountered.

The research combined a sophisticated analysis of blood samples from bladder cancer patients who had been treated with BCG with studies in mouse models of bladder cancer.

Dr. Andrew Daman

The study was led by co-first authors Dr. Andrew Daman, a postdoctoral researcher in the Josefowicz Lab, and Dr. Anthony Antonelli, a postdoc in the Glickman Lab — who initially conceived of and initiated the project as graduate students in the Weill Cornell Medicine Graduate School of Medical Sciences — as well as Dr. Gil Redelman-Sidi, an infectious disease specialist at MSK and member of the Glickman Lab.

Studying BCG’s Effects Outside of the Bladder

Scientists have known that BCG, which is injected into the bladder through a catheter, acts locally as an immunotherapy by improving the ability of T cells to eliminate cancer cells. But exactly how this was accomplished wasn’t entirely clear.

“Medicine’s long understanding has been that in order to work as a treatment, BCG has to be in direct contact with the tumor site,” Dr. Daman said. “And you can introduce high concentrations of BCG into the bladder in a way that you can’t with other types of cancer, and which doesn’t require pumping it throughout the whole body, risking toxic side effects.”

The new study maps BCG’s broader effects outside the bladder.

Previous research had shown that when given as a vaccine, BCG bacteria raise the body’s general defenses against a variety of other infections, including viruses. A recent clinical trial, for example, found the BCG vaccine helped protect nursing home residents against viral respiratory infections.

Dr. Anthony Antonelli

“So, the question was whether this broader, nonspecific protection that gets stimulated by BCG in the context of infections extends to cancer as well,” Dr. Antonelli said. “The scientific understanding had been that BCG was basically confined to the bladder, which is where it was having its effect. But that turns out not to be the full story.”

New Insights Into BCG’s Anti-Cancer Effects

The team showed that when BCG was administered to mice in their bladders, the bacteria traveled to their bone marrow — and could actually be cultured directly from it.

And it is in the bone marrow, where new immune cells get made, that the bacteria influence the entire body — priming the innate immune system to react to new threats (just as it did for the nursing home residents given BCG vaccinations).

Shifting their attention from mice to bladder cancer patients treated with BCG, the researchers used Progenitor Input Enrichment single cell sequencing (PIE-seq) — a specialized analytical method developed by the Josefowicz Lab — which deeply studies rare circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from a simple blood draw rather than from a bone marrow sample, the way these cells are typically studied. This approach enabled the researchers to understand how BCG treatment affects stem cells, the early development of immune cells, and the mature myeloid cells that they become.

By comparing gene activity before and after BCG treatment, researchers discovered important changes. The study showed that BCG treatment alters the programming of stem cells and early-stage blood cells in the bone marrow. As a result, new immune cells that develop from these reprogrammed cells become better at fighting tumors.

Dr. Gil Redelman-Sidi

“These findings show that this training of the innate immune system that happens with the BCG vaccine also happens in the context of bladder administration of BCG to treat cancer,” Dr. Redelman-Sidi said.

The study was made possible by the ongoing collection of blood samples from BCG-treated bladder cancer patients by MSK urologic surgeon Dr. Eugene Pietzak, who was a co-author of the study. The research also included patients from McGill University.

Combining BCG With Checkpoint Inhibitors

Additionally, the scientists demonstrated in mice that when BCG was combined with another type of immunotherapy called checkpoint inhibitor therapy, it was better at shrinking tumors and extending life than either treatment alone.

Checkpoint inhibitors work by releasing the “brake” on T cells, allowing the body to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. These T cells, in turn, take instruction from the myeloid cells that the paper shows BCG stimulates, creating a synergy between the two approaches.

“So, this has broad implications for immunotherapy more generally,” Dr. Josefowicz said. “We now know that this reprogramming of immune cells that happens in the bone marrow that enhances innate immunity responses can be a strategy to enhance the effects of existing immunotherapies.”

Next steps for the research could explore new ways to stimulate this reprogramming, as well as studying whether introducing BCG into the bladder could boost the effectiveness of immunotherapy against other types of cancer.

“Of course, right now that’s quite speculative,” Dr. Glickman noted.

"Poland cuts household gas prices, raising chances of lower interest rates","WARSAW, May 29 (Reuters) - Poland's energy market regulator has cut the gas prices that wholesaler PGNiG Obrot Detaliczny charges to households and vulnerable users including hospitals and schools by 14.8%, increasing the chance of more interest rate cuts.

Gas distribution fees remain unchanged, which will result in average gas bills falling by between 8.1% and 11% depending on the volume of consumption, the regulator, URE, said on Thursday.

Gas prices for households are set by the regulator and have a major impact on inflation. Uncertainty over energy prices has been the main factor behind central bank's reluctance to cut interest rates faster.

As a result of the cut in gas prices, inflation may fall close to 2.5%, the mid-point of the central bank's target range, in July, and the central bank may cut rates further, ING economists said on X following the announcement.

""Our current scenario assuming 75 basis points of cuts by the end of the year and to 3.75% in 2026 is the minimum scenario,"" they said. The rate is currently 5.25%.

"Tariff turmoil clouds European investment banks' advisory, underwriting outlook","Tariff-induced volatility is expected to dampen second-quarter advisory and underwriting revenue at most of Europe's largest investment banks.

Barclays PLC, BNP Paribas SA, Société Générale SA, HSBC Holdings PLC and UBS Group AG will post weaker revenue in the segment for the second quarter compared to the previous three-month period, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha, a part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Deutsche Bank AG is the only one among the continent's six leading players forecast to book a revenue increase, thanks to stronger debt origination, which accounted for over 60% of its advisory and underwriting activities in the first quarter.

Uncertainty related to US tariffs and their impact on markets, monetary policy and economic growth has dimmed the prospects for a recovery in dealmaking and IPO activity this year. Equity underwriting and advisory estimates have been trending downward since the beginning of 2025, Visible Alpha analysts said in a May 9 note.

""The outlook has become more difficult for senior leaders to predict, likely putting deals and transactions on hold,"" the analysts said.

Debt underwriting, on the other hand, has been relatively steady, which could be a sign of underlying stability in market conditions and borrowers' creditworthiness, according to the analysts.

Soon after the tariff announcements in early April, analyst consensus estimates for advisory and equity underwriting fees at the largest five US investment banks — Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley — were also downgraded, Visible Alpha data compiled by Market Intelligence shows. In contrast, debt underwriting projections were upgraded.

Banks hopeful

In the first quarter, advisory and underwriting revenue increased across most major European and US investment banks compared to a year ago, data compiled by Market Intelligence shows.

Based on filings of banks that report revenue by business separately, advisory and debt underwriting largely increased year over year, while equity underwriting revenue fell at most banks.

Deutsche Bank and UBS, which booked the largest year-over-year declines, are both hopeful of an improvement later in the year.

""While the market environment weighed on our [investment] banking results across products and regions, and despite growing economic uncertainty, our pipeline continues to build,"" UBS CFO Todd Tuckner said during the group's first-quarter earnings call on April 30.

UBS was dragged down by a drop in underwriting revenue, largely driven by weaker leverage finance business. Equity underwriting was also weaker, but the bank is focused on boosting its pipeline, which should ""yield meaningful returns over the medium term,"" Tuckner said.

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing also spoke of a ""robust pipeline"" in the group's advisory and origination (O&A) business during its latest earnings call, projecting ""healthy numbers"" for the second and third quarter.

""We see some delayed deals, but no deal is canceled,"" Sewing said.

Deutsche Bank's first-quarter O&A revenue decline was due to a weaker debt underwriting result related to ""a loss on the partial sale and markdown of a specific loan"" in the group's leveraged finance business, CFO James von Moltke said.

Advisory slowdown

Compared to the previous quarter, overall revenue at most banks was lower in the first three months of 2025, primarily due to weaker advisory. Bank of America, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS all posted quarter-over-quarter revenue drops in that line of business, the data shows.

Earlier hopes for a dealmaking boom were quashed by ""the reality of tariff-driven uncertainty, still-elevated interest rates and choppy equity markets,"" JP Morgan said in its 2025 midyear outlook report. Public market activity, notably the IPO space, has been very quiet, and projections for M&A activity growth have been cut in recent months, the bank said.

While there were some green shoots with global M&A activity rising 17% year over year in the first quarter, ""the prospect of prolonged uncertainty has created a cloudier outlook on the pace for dealmaking, at least over the near term,"" JP Morgan said.",https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/5/tariff-turmoil-clouds-european-investment-banks-advisory-underwriting-outlook-89540431,Business

SEC Roundtable on Tokenization: Technology Meets Regulation in the Evolution of Capital Markets,"LawFlash SEC Roundtable on Tokenization: Technology Meets Regulation in the Evolution of Capital Markets May 29, 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission recently convened a public roundtable, Tokenization – Moving Assets Onchain: Where TradFi and DeFi Meet, the fourth in a five-part series hosted by its Crypto Task Force. The May 12 roundtable included representatives from traditional financial institutions, exchanges, asset managers, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and legal and policy experts to examine the current state of asset tokenization and identify potential regulatory, technological, and operational implications of transitioning traditional financial assets onto blockchain-based platforms.

The Tokenization Roundtable is the fourth roundtable in the series Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity. The roundtables reflect the Staff’s continued interest in understanding how crypto asset technologies interact with existing securities laws and signal growing momentum toward formal rulemaking and interpretive guidance in this area.

The panelists broadly agreed that tokenization has the potential to transform capital markets while also underscoring the need for regulatory clarity, technical standards, and appropriate safeguards to ensure market integrity and investor protection.

FRAMING TOKENIZATION: A TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFT, NOT A NEW ASSET CLASS

Across the discussion, a consistent theme emerged: tokenization is best understood as a technology-enabled process, not a new type of asset. At its core, tokenization refers to placing real-world financial instruments (such as equities, bonds, or fund interests) onto a blockchain, enabling programmable ownership and related transaction features.

Some compared this transformation to the evolution from certificated shares to electronic records, with the leap to tokenization offering the prospect of additional features such as the ability to incorporate automated compliance, real-time settlement, and improved transparency and inclusion for investors.

CHAIRMAN ATKINS’ KEYNOTE ADDRESS

SEC Chairman Paul Atkins gave the keynote address, highlighting the energy behind moving from traditional “off-chain” databases to blockchain-based “on-chain” ledger systems. Chairman Atkins stated that migration to on-chain securities has the potential to remodel aspects of the securities market, enabling new ways of issuing, trading, owning, and using securities, such as using smart contracts for transparent dividend distribution or enhancing capital formation by transforming illiquid assets into liquid investment opportunities. He noted this technology holds promise for novel use cases not currently contemplated by the SEC’s legacy rules.

Chairman Atkins stated his objective is to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that consists of clear rules for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to deter illegal activity. He outlined the SEC’s goals and the challenges it faces with respect to three areas of focus for crypto asset policy:

1. Issuance

The SEC intends to establish clear and sensible guidelines for distributions of crypto assets that qualify as securities or are subject to an investment contract. Challenges currently exist with satisfying disclosure requirements and determining if a crypto asset is a security. Chairman Atkins criticized past approaches, described as “head in the sand” and “regulation through enforcement,” which did not adapt disclosure requirements for this new technology.

The SEC is now pursuing a new course, with Staff recently issuing statements on disclosure obligations and clarifying that certain distributions and assets do not implicate federal securities laws. However, existing registration exemptions and safe harbors may not be fit for purpose, making SEC action—beyond Staff pronouncements—vital and necessary. The Staff is considering whether additional guidance, exemptions, and safe harbors are needed to create pathways for crypto asset issuances in the United States.

2. Custody

The SEC supports providing registrants with greater optionality in determining how to custody crypto assets. The recent rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 is viewed as removing a significant impediment to the custody of crypto assets, however, further clarity is needed on which types of custodians qualify as “qualified custodians” and on reasonable exceptions for common crypto practices.

Updates to custody rules may be necessary to allow advisers and funds to engage in self-custody under certain circumstances. The “special purpose broker-dealer” framework may need to be repealed and replaced with a more rational regime, and clarity is needed on applying customer protection and net capital rules to crypto custody by broker-dealers.

3. Trading

Chairman Atkins favors allowing registrants to trade a broader variety of products, responding to market demand. This could include enabling “super apps” or “pairs trading” between securities and non-securities. Staff have been asked to explore modernizing the Alternative Trading System regulatory regime and whether guidance or rulemaking is needed for listing and trading crypto assets on national securities exchanges.

In addition to outlining the three areas of focus for the SEC’s regulation of crypto assets going forward, Chairman Atkins proposed exploring whether conditional exemptive relief would be appropriate for registrants and nonregistrants bringing new products and services to market that may not currently be compatible with existing rules. Chairman Atkins stated the goal is to coordinate the SEC’s efforts with the administration and the US Congress to make the United States the global leader of crypto asset markets.

COMMISSIONERS DISCUSS TOKENIZATION: PRIMARY BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES

Before the panel discussions began, the SEC commissioners provided insight into challenges and objectives they believe the Staff and the panelists should take into consideration when discussing the regulation and facilitation of tokenization.

SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw expressed concerns and potential shortcomings of tokenization and its ability to increase market efficiency. She expressed significant doubts about the ability of tokenization to speed up settlement due to issues with scaling, and also suggested that the delay created by the current T+1 settlement cycle is a feature and not a bug, providing for more stable markets in times of stress.

She explained that the current system facilitates netting, which drastically reduces the volume requiring final settlement, which is key to handling high trading volumes, market stability, and facilitating liquidity. She called for extreme regulatory caution and reiterated the importance of protecting traditional markets, noting that it is estimated that less than 5% of US households are involved in crypto and therefore any changes to financial market regulations must not be detrimental to the TradFi markets that most Americans depend on.

SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda noted that the new technologies related to tokenization could benefit investors by enhancing liquidity for otherwise relatively illiquid assets, reducing delays associated with intermediation, and decreasing transactional costs. Tokenization also has the potential to simplify or streamline certain compliance functions through smart contracts for on-chain assets.

These potential improvements are tied to key characteristics of blockchain technology such as its transparent ledger and decentralized nature. Commissioner Uyeda stated that when considering the implications of new technologies the Commission should focus on designing a framework that includes critical safeguards rather than trying to address every possible investment permutation and scenario.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce listed the potential benefits that tokenization may have on securities markets, including increased operational efficiency, transactional transparency, liquidity, and accessibility; faster settlement (potentially near-instant and simultaneous on the same network); and greater investor opportunity. Tokenized securities can be used as collateral and a means of settlement for other crypto assets on-chain. Commissioner Peirce expressed the need for legal clarity for tokenization to reach its full potential.

She noted several issues that create uncertainty, including whether a crypto network can serve as the master securityholder file for Exchange Act transfer agent rules, confusion regarding a broker-dealer’s ability to custody tokenized traditional securities due to the special purpose broker-dealer statement, and a proposed Advisers Act custody rule amendment that could preclude tokenized traditional securities on public, permissionless networks from an exception to the qualified custodian requirement. She concluded that, absent a compelling factual and legal reason, the SEC should treat tokenized securities the same as traditionally issued securities.

THE EVOLUTION OF FINANCE: CAPITAL MARKETS 2.0

The first panel of the Tokenization Roundtable featured a diverse panel of experts from leading financial institutions from the crypto asset industry. The discussion addressed terminology used by the crypto industry, exploring opportunities and challenges presented by current regulatory infrastructure and existing law, and offered practical advice from the industry to the SEC on how to best move forward.

Key Discussions

Opportunities in Tokenization and Blockchain: Panelists discussed the potential of tokenization to enhance shareholder communication, improve proxy and dividend distributions, and increase operational efficiencies. Tokenization was generally described as a way to de-risk markets by shortening settlement cycles and present a pathway toward 24/7 global capital markets.

Regulatory and Infrastructure Challenges: The panel highlighted the desire for a regulatory sandbox to encourage innovation and stressed the importance of regulatory interoperability among different tokenization platforms. They emphasized the need for a clear crypto asset taxonomy and, accordingly, to adjust rules and regulations to fit the evolving financial landscape.

Investor Protections and Compliance: Improved investor protections and compliance capabilities were examined, and panelists discussed how to ensure that only eligible investors could engage with tokenized securities. The role of smart contracts in automating compliance and reducing costs was also highlighted by the panel.

Evolution of Financial Markets: The panelists reflected on the evolution of financial markets from paper to digital and the role of fintech in providing trading and market surveillance capabilities. They discussed how tokenization could ease congestion within the traditional market system and improve collateral management.

Future of Capital Markets: The discussion included the potential for tokenized securities to democratize access to investing and the role of digital assets in providing real-time market efficiencies. The panelists explored the idea of tokenized stable value yield funds and their benefits for institutional investors.

Practical Advice for the SEC

Regulatory Framework: The panelists advised the SEC to consider a regulatory framework that supports innovation while remaining focused on investor protection. They suggested using exemptive and no-action relief to address market-driven issues and emphasized the importance of a common regulatory framework to facilitate capital formation.

Intermediary Evolution: The panel discussed the role of intermediaries in the evolving financial landscape, with a focus on how intermediaries would need to adapt to these new technologies. The panelists highlighted the importance of choice in intermediary interactions and the potential for automated market making without intermediaries.

Regulatory Innovation Programs: The panel again discussed the use of regulatory sandboxes to test new technologies and better inform legislation, and emphasized the need for a practical sandbox environment that focuses on how test runs can directly inform regulatory rules.

The panel concluded with a call for the traditional financial industry to embrace new technologies and for the SEC to adopt regulatory frameworks that support innovation while maintaining investor trust and market acceptance. The panelists stressed the importance of not allowing outdated regulations to hinder the progress of new players in the financial markets.

THE FUTURE OF TOKENIZATION

The second panel of the Tokenization Roundtable, The Future of Tokenization, showcased a multidisciplinary panel of experts, including academics, legal scholars, digital asset platform leaders, and investors. The discussion explored the evolving landscape of tokenization, examining future use cases and potential regulatory considerations for the SEC as it navigates the evolving digital asset space.

Identified Benefits: Efficiency, Inclusion, and Market Modernization

The panelists identified several key benefits that tokenization could bring to capital markets, centered around operational efficiency, broader market access, and structural innovation:

Operational Efficiency and Streamlined Settlement: Tokenized assets can utilize smart contracts to automate a wide range of functions, including corporate actions (e.g., dividend distributions), compliance monitoring, and settlement processes. This automation has the potential to significantly reduce costs, enhance accuracy, and expedite settlement.

Financial Inclusion: Tokenization can lower barriers to entry for investors by enabling 24/7 access to markets, which can broaden investor participation, and reducing reliance on traditional financial intermediaries. These features may enhance access to investment opportunities, particularly for retail investors.

Increased Transparency and Auditability: By recording asset ownership and transaction history on immutable public ledgers, tokenization offers significantly enhanced auditability and transparency. This infrastructure may also reduce the potential for insider misuse and manipulation, and streamline oversight functions for regulators and auditors.

Regulatory Considerations and Challenges

While the technological promise of tokenization was widely acknowledged, the panelists also highlighted several regulatory and legal uncertainties that need to be addressed to foster broader adoption:

Interoperability and Market Fragmentation: Panelists expressed concern over the risks of liquidity fragmentation across blockchains and protocols. The lack of standardized protocols across different blockchain platforms can hinder seamless asset transfers.

Custody and Control: Clarity is needed around the regulatory treatment of custodianship for tokenized assets. Key questions remain as to whether these assets can be held directly by investors or must be maintained by qualified custodians, and how existing securities laws apply in a tokenized context.

Smart Contract Risks: While smart contracts can encode legal and compliance obligations into self-executing code, concerns were raised about their rigidity; specifically, panelists noted challenges in modifying or terminating flawed or outdated contract logic, particularly in volatile or fast-changing market conditions.

The panel concluded with diverging perspectives on how the SEC should navigate the complexities of tokenization and blockchain regulation. Some panelists suggested convening a meeting of experts from various fields to collaborate and address these challenges, while others advocated for the SEC to establish its own set of guiding principles.

The discussion also highlighted the difficulties the SEC faces in attempting to regulate technologies and entities that currently fall outside its existing framework as well as certain technological issues that remain unresolved by mathematicians, such as the interoperability of blockchain systems. These challenges underscore the need for a flexible and thoughtful approach to regulation that balances innovation with market integrity.

NEXT STEPS AND CONSIDERATIONS

The Tokenization Roundtable reflects the SEC’s ongoing efforts to engage with industry stakeholders and explore the integration of emerging technologies into the regulatory landscape. As tokenization continues to evolve, market participants should monitor regulator developments and assess the implications for their operations and compliance obligations.

Gaza civil defence says 44 killed in Israel attacks Thursday,"GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli attacks killed 44 people on Thursday, including 23 in a strike on a home in the centre of the Palestinian territory.

“Forty-four people have been killed in Israeli raids on the Gaza Strip,” civil defence official Mohammad al-Mughayyir told AFP.

“Twenty-three people were killed, others injured and several (are) missing following an Israeli strike on the Qreinawi family’s home east of Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.”

Mughayyir also reported “two people killed and several injured by Israeli forces’ gunfire this morning near the American aid centre in the Morag axis, southern Gaza Strip.”

When asked by AFP about the strike in Al-Bureij and the gunfire near the aid centre, the Israeli military said it was looking into them.

The centre, run by a US-backed organisation, is part of a new plan for distributing aid in Gaza that Israel says is meant to keep supplies out of the hands of Hamas, but which has drawn criticism from the United Nations and the European Union.

AFP footage from Al-Bureij showed Palestinians searching through the rubble of a destroyed building.

Israeli strikes on school housing displaced and on market kill 48 in Gaza

In a statement, the military said it had struck “dozens of terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip” over the past day.

“Among the targets struck were terrorists, military structures, observation and sniper posts that posed a threat to IDF troops in the area, tunnels and additional terrorist infrastructure sites,” it added.

Earlier this month, Israel stepped up its offensive in Gaza, triggered by an attack by Palestinian group Hamas on October 7, 2023.

The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of some 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.

Out of 251 hostages seized during the October 7 attack, 57 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.

Mediators continue to push for a ceasefire that remains elusive.

The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Thursday at least 3,986 people had been killed in the territory since Israel ended a two-month ceasefire on March 18, taking the war’s overall toll to 54,249, mostly civilians.",https://www.brecorder.com/news/40365284,World
"S&P 500 rises on the back of Nvidia's gain, but overall rally is muted because of trade policy confusion: Live updates","Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on May 27, 2025 in New York City.

The S&P 500 ticked higher on Thursday as Nvidia shares staged a post-earnings rally. But gains were restricted as investors wondered what would come next after a federal court knocked down President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs.

The broad index climbed 0.3% after trading as high as 0.9% up at session highs. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%, also well off its highest intraday gain of 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sat near flat, weighed down by a slide of more than 7% in Salesforce following earnings.

The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled on Wednesday night that Trump overstepped his authority when he imposed his ""reciprocal"" tariffs. The court ordered that the challenged tariff orders be vacated.

Trump's changing approach toward trade policy, as well as inflation fears fueled by the prospect of the tariffs, roiled markets last month. Some companies have also highlighted the levies and dialed back their forecasts, pointing to uncertainty around trade policy and the impact on the consumer.

For now, the judges' decision appears to have allayed some investors' worries. However, this development can also raise concerns that U.S. trade negotiations with foreign countries could be drawn out into later in the year than previously anticipated.

""The tariff drama isn't over,"" Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge wrote in a note. ""Trump has other legal avenues to pursue an aggressive tariff agenda, and investors expect he will utilize them.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html,World

Technology impact: Gates Cambridge at 25,"Gates Cambridge Scholars have been having an impact in multiple areas of new technology, from tackling misinformation to biotech, green tech and more.

We cannot just rely on the developers to build something that is ethical and of benefit to all of humanity. Developers are experts in their field, but we need to include way more people in the process and to build a more AI-literate society which understands the risks and limitations of AI as well as its possibilities. Hannah Claus

Technology is embedded in every inch of our lives these days, but the increasing domination of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, including ChatGPT, raise many questions about fairness, about oversight, about the potential for abuse and about what makes us human in the digital age.

Gates Cambridge Scholars are active in every area of new technology and the debates it throws up – from academic research on how it works and what its implications are to its application in many different fields including security, business innovation, health and climate change activity to how we mitigate against misinformation and abuse.

Here we look at some of the Gates Cambridge Scholars who are making an impact in the technology sphere.

Research

Many scholars are involved in research which pushes the boundaries of how technology works and how it can be more accessible to all.

Richard Diehl’s research looks at how to change the way AI learns so that it is more human-like and not just learning through the inputting and processing of a mountain of data, so that it moves from a big data model to a smaller, smarter model based on meta learning. His end goal is to be able to teach AI to learn languages where there is not a lot of textual or spoken data rather than being biased in favour of languages like English. To date, Richard [2021] has created an AI framework, Pico, which demystifies how language models learn by training and analysing models across different scales. The focus on smarter, smaller AI is a huge issue, given concerns about AI’s environmental footprint.

Pradipta Biswas [2006] is also doing innovative research to improve human machine interaction, particularly for those with disabilities. At Cambridge, for instance, he explored visual and auditory perception, rapid aiming movement and problem-solving strategies in the context of human machine interaction. He also invented new algorithms, for instance, for use in eye gaze technology. Among the technologies he has patented is an eye gaze and gesture controlled interactive Head Up Display.

Since returning to India, he has built on his work on eye tracking technology working with the Indian air force. He has also led a project to design a virtual reality cockpit for India’s maiden human space flight mission and was one of five researchers in India selected to undertake research study on human machine interaction at the International Space Station during the Axiom 4 mission. He has also led the first of its kind toy hackathon to help children with severe disabilities to communicate through eye-controlled interfaces. Pradipta, now an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, was also Vice Chair of the International Telecommunication Union [ITU], the oldest UN agency, founded in 1865, to facilitate international connectivity in communications networks.

Several scholars are doing PhDs in the relatively new field of Digital Humanities, bridging the gap between technology and the arts, addressing some of the ethical questions that the digital age throws up and ensuring humans are at the centre of debates about technological innovation. They include incoming scholar Eryk Salvaggio [2025] who has worked for decades in the area of arts and technology. His interest was ignited back in the 1990s when he discovered the net.art movement and became involved in experimental online art and writing. His PhD will produce frameworks that examine assumptions about the use of generative AI in policy, pedagogy and design. He says: “I am interested in what this technology is capable of, what we want to say yes to and how we use the humanities lens to understand what patterns and what new things it may be creating. I am trying to figure out how we approach this newness, how we use it for the benefit of human problems so we can be proactive and not overtaken by it.”

Similarly, Alex Mentzel’s work explores the intersection of human and digital worlds with the aim of avoiding the potential negative connotations and risks that we might not foresee, such as discriminatory systems of surveillance and gender and racial bias, consequences that will be amplified in cross-reality environments. As a spin-off from this Alex [2022] has created a public-facing performance research project, the Faust Shop, which investigates the Faustian bargains we make with technology in a mixed reality pop-up experience.

Tristan Dot [2022] studies the millions of images circulated every day through global networks which are automatically analysed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Increasingly, the same AI models are used in art history to develop inventive digital methods to study large-scale datasets outside the Western canon. Tristan’s work is attempting to determine the place of computational formalism in the historiography of formalism in order to better understand AI-encoded digital images. He says: “I am convinced that art history will help us determine the issues of power, domination and invisibilisation at stake behind the circulation of digital images nowadays.”

Meanwhile, current Scholar Hannah Claus [2024] is interested in the development of responsible and inclusive AI systems, ensuring that language technologies are accessible, fair and culturally sensitive across diverse communities worldwide.

She says there is a need to reflect the vast richness of humanity in AI and to include information from as many different cultural and human perspectives as possible. “We cannot just rely on the developers to build something that is ethical and of benefit to all of humanity,” she says. “Developers are experts in their field, but we need to include way more people in the process and to build a more AI-literate society which understands the risks and limitations of AI as well as its possibilities.”

Security

Other scholars are more involved in how technology is being used in today’s work, for instance, in the field of security.

Christopher Kirchhoff is co-author with Raj M Shah of Unit X: How the Pentagon and Silicon Valley Are Transforming the Future of War. The two men know more about Unit X than most as they co-founded it in 2016. Kirchhoff [2001] had already served as a strategist in President Obama‘s National Security Council and as the civilian assistant to General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when he was appointed by the Secretary of Defense to create and launch the Pentagon’s Silicon Valley Office. There he led 67 civilian and uniformed personnel overseeing over 100 projects piloting advanced commercial technology, from flying cars to microsatellites, in military missions. The unit tested the innovative technology which was used in the air operations software that prevented ISIS from committing genocide as well as space-based Synthetic-aperture radar imaging used to detect North Korean and Russian missile launches.

Christopher’s book paints a picture of the role of innovation and technology in geopolitical power and details some of the innovations that came out of the unit. These range from flying cars that can land like helicopters and artificial intelligence-powered drones that can fly into buildings and map their interiors to microsatellites that can see through clouds and monitor rogue missile sites.

General David Petraeus, former Director of the CIA, called it “an illuminating, behind-the-scenes examination of the numerous, critical, and sometimes competing efforts inside the Pentagon to change the way it does business. An exceedingly important book!”

Joe Bonneau [2008] is a cryptography expert and co-author of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies, a textbook on cryptocurrencies, which was runner-up for the 2017 PROSE Award in Computing and Information Sciences from the Association of American Publishers. Joe is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department of the Courant Institute at New York University. His research focuses on applied cryptography and security engineering, in particular, human authentication, secure messaging tools, blockchains and decentralised systems, and public randomness protocols.

Business innovation

Other scholars have used their technology knowledge in the business field.

Tim Kotin [2012] is currently Director of Data Analytics at AmaliTech, an IT service company, where he leads the strategic development and execution of the company’s Data Analytics and Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities. AmaliTech aims to empower IT talent from Ghana, Rwanda, and other African countries, while expanding its impact across Europe and other key markets. It also has a focus onCorporate Social Responsibility and Tim is looking at how its data and AI solutions can serve non-profits and local organisations in Africa, contributing to social impact and sustainable development.

Tim, who did an MPhil in Engineering for Sustainable Development, has spent much of his career working with or founding start-ups in the IT sector and describes himself as being “passionate about overcoming challenges of global scale and relevance through cutting-edge technologies, effective policy and innovative business models”.

Talia Gershon [2008] is a materials scientist by training and started working at IBM Research in 2012. After 4.5 years of developing next-generation solar cell materials, she became inspired to learn about quantum computing. She passionately believes that anyone can get started learning quantum and her online tutorial, the Beginner’s Guide to the QX, has got over 8,000 likes on Youtube. She now leads the hybrid cloud infrastructure research team at IBM Research, a team of world-class research scientists and engineers “with the mission of inventing the future of cloud computing”. The team works on everything from systems innovation, software innovation, linux and AI to DevOps/CICD which seeks to streamline and accelerate the software development lifecycle. The team recently launched IBM Research’s first AI-optimised, cloud-native supercomputer.

Mohammad Ghassemi [2010] is also leading the way in tech entrepreneurship. He combines an academic career in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University with being Founding Partner of Ghamut, which works with organisations including Thomson Reuters and the Gates Foundation to improve their strategic use of data and technology.

Mohammad, who did his MPhil in Information Engineering at Cambridge, worked on a number of smart medical devices after graduating. He is driven by a desire to use AI for the common good. For instance, during his PhD at MIT, he set up MIT Connect, an organisation which matched up graduate students for friendship rather than romantic reasons.

Another Scholar who is pushing the boundaries in technology research from a business perspective is Alex Davies [2010]. He is Lead of AI for Maths at Google DeepMind, the British–American artificial intelligence research laboratory. AI for Maths’ work on how machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems was featured on the front cover of Nature magazine. He has previously worked on making phone batteries more efficient, based on studying user habits to determine what apps they use, when and delegating power accordingly. Before DeepMind Alex worked at Google on planning, implementing and scaling machine learning solutions.

From green tech to health and biotech

Scholars have also been active in using technology for sustainable futures. For instance, Impact Prize winner Uche Ogechukwu [2024] co-founded Greenage Technologies which aims to harness renewable energy to combat energy poverty and environmental degradation in Africa. Since it was founded the company has put solar energy solutions in the homes of thousands of people, hospitals and schools in Nigeria. Uche, who is doing an MPhil in Technology Policy, says: “I am passionate about sustainable development in Africa’s energy sector. For that reason, I co-founded Greenage Technologies to combat energy poverty. With a background in technology from the private sector, I’m eager to explore technology’s policy aspects and collaborate with the Gates Cambridge community to drive positive change.”

Josh Weygant [2023] is among a number of Scholars who are working in the field of biotechnology. His research focuses on 3D bioprinting of human organs, a subject that is very personal to him since he lost half of his large intestine at the age of one. In the next decades it is hoped that 3D bioprinting will be able to extract a person’s living cells and use them to print a functional organ that is adapted to their body. In the shorter term, Josh is working on 3D bioprinting that can develop better treatments for common medical ailments because it allows scientists to create mini organs outside the body which behave as they would do inside it. Currently, treatments are tested in environments that do not represent what is going on in the human body.

Several scholars work in the field of health tech. They include Alexandra Grigore [2012] and Toby Norman [2011], Co-Founders of Simprints, the world’s first open-source biometric ID platform with privacy at its core. The company has now reached over three million people across 17 countries and anticipates that impact will increase tenfold in the next years. In the 10 years since it started, Simprints has worked with partners including the International Committee of the Red Cross on safe digital ID cryptography and with Gavi on breakthrough biometric algorithms to ensure children receive vital vaccines. The impact of Simprints’ work can be seen, for example, in a 38% increase in maternal health visits in Bangladesh and a 62% boost in accurate HIV tracing in Malawi.

On the other side of the coin, current Scholar Christine Carpenter [2024] is interested in ensuring technology is not used to restrict women’s freedom. Her PhD centres on the industry known as FemTech (short for “Female Technology”) and data privacy protection law in the larger context of digital surveillance. She is interested in the risk individuals who use fertility and period-tracking apps run in terms of having their data potentially subpoenaed and used in court to show they have had an abortion.

Misinformation/ethics

A big issue in the field of technology is whether science is racing ahead without the potential social and other implications of what it can do being taken into account. With Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton, referred to as the Godfather of AI, warning about the potential dangers of the technology he pioneered, there is a lot of concern about the power of technology for bad, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

A big area of interest is misinformation and bias and many Scholars are tackling this in their work. For instance, Melisa Basol [2018] who, as a PhD Scholar, worked with Professor Sander van der Linden on a ‘psychological vaccine’ against misinformation. She now heads Pulse, an innovation lab which crafts “evidence-based strategies that ensure resilient and responsible technological innovation across society”. It integrates psychological insights with technology to develop human-centred innovation which anticipates future challenges.

Jonathan Ong [2007], Associate Professor of Global Digital Media at the University of Massachusetts – Amherst, looks at the issue of misinformation from the viewpoint of global media ethics, digital politics and the anthropology of humanitarianism. In his disinformation studies research, he uses ethnography to understand the social identities, work arrangements and moral justifications of “paid trolls” and political public relations strategists. His “disinformation whistleblowers podcast” Catch Me If You Can, was ranked in Top 5% Most Followed Podcasts globally by Spotify in 2022.

Meanwhile, Andrew Gruen [2008] runs planning and special initiatives functions at the Mozilla Foundation in addition to managing the organisation’s policy, advocacy and campaigns work. The Foundation develops technology and data to support better human-centred technology futures. Andrew, who runs his own consultancy, is also a senior fellow at the Future of Privacy Forum, which is working on creating more regulatory clarity on the best uses of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to enable more data sharing and more/better quality analytics, while also providing the people represented by that data with better guarantees around their own rights.

Molly Crockett [2006], a cognitive scientist at Princeton University who studies human morality, altruism and decision-making, is also interested in issues around ethics and morality. Research in her lab investigates how people learn and make decisions in social situations, for instance, how people decide whether to help or harm, punish or forgive, trust or condemn. Recently, the lab has focused more on moral cognition in the digital age and across different types of social relationships, including how these themes connect with the psychology of the self and identity. She recently wrote an op-ed about the way some researchers are staging “competitions” in which AI technology appears to outperform humans in human areas such as empathy. She says the competitions are rigged against humans because they don’t ask machines to perform human tasks. She states: “It’s more accurate to say that they ask humans to behave in machine-like ways as they perform lifeless simulacra of human tasks.”

Other scholars who are researching in the area of ethics and technology include Kerry McInerney [2017] who leads a popular podcast, The Good Robot, and is co-author of The Good Robot: Why technology needs feminism which asks questions such as what is good technology, is it possible and how can feminism help us work towards it?

She is interested in ensuring we take a balanced view towards AI. “There’s so much hype and mystique around AI,” she says. “I am trying to make sure that we talk about AI in ways that are accurate, measured and not overhyping AI’s capabilities.”

Israeli strikes destroy last plane at airport run by Houthis,"SANAA: Israeli air strikes blew up the last remaining plane at Yemen’s Houthi-held international airport, Israel and a Yemeni official said on Wednesday, weeks after an earlier attack inflicted major damage.

An air raid involving multiple strikes hit the Yemenia Airways plane and the runway at Sanaa airport, the Houthis’ Al-Masirah TV channel posted on X, decrying Israeli aggression.

Thick black smoke was seen billowing from a stricken plane on the tarmac, in a video posted on X by Sanaa airport director Khaled al-Shaief who said it was Yemenia’s last operational aircraft.

The airport had only resumed limited commercial services on May 17, according to Houthi authorities, after it was closed by a heavy Israeli attack that destroyed six planes 11 days earlier.

The Houthis, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians, have been firing on Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza conflict, prompting reprisal strikes from Israel as well as the United States and Britain.

Israel’s Defence Minis­ter Israel Katz said fighter jets targeted Houthi “terror targets” at the airport, a day after the group fired two projectiles at Israel. “Air Force jets have just struck terror targets of the Houthi terrorist organisation at the airport in Sanaa and destroyed the last aircraft remaining,” he said in a statement.

An Israeli military statement said aircraft there “were used by the Houthi organisation for the transfer of militants who advanced attacks against the state of Israel”.

According to a statement from Yemenia, the plane was about to be boarded by pilgrims bound for the annual Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.

‘Fragile situation’

The Houthis began their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in Nov 2023, weeks after the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict, prompting British and US military strikes beginning in January 2024.

Earlier this month, the United States agreed a ceasefire with the Huthis, ending weeks of intense American strikes on rebel-held areas.

However, the Houthis have continued to fire frequent projectiles at Israel, including strikes targeting Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv. Earlier this month, Israel threatened to target the Houthi leadership.

United Nations special envoy Hans Grundberg warned in a statement that clashes between the Houthis and Israel are “exacerbating an already very fragile situation for Yemen and the region”. The Houthis had earlier paused their attacks during a two-month ceasefire in Gaza that collapsed in March.

The Houthis have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 in a conflict that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and triggered a major humanitarian crisis in Yemen, although fighting has decreased significantly since a UN-negotiated six-month truce in 2022.

That year the airport, closed for six years during the war, reopened to commercial flights and has offered services to and from Amman in Jordan.

Doing economic policy in disrupted times,"Three leading economic thinkers spoke about how to do economic policy in today's disrupted world at a panel event last night

Three leading thinkers involved in the cut and thrust of policy-making took part in a panel event at Bill Gates Sr House last night to discuss doing policy in an age when policy processes are subject to major disruption.

The speakers were Gates Cambridge Scholar Todd Tucker [2012], director of industrial policy and trade at the Roosevelt Institute, Shachi Amdekar, who leads international security policy in the UK Cabinet Office, and Tim Sahay, co-director of the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University.

The event, hosted by Gates Cambridge Provost Eilis Ferran and in partnership with the Centre of Development Studies at the University of Cambridge, began with each of the speakers outlining their own career paths into the policy world.

The headline of the panel event, Doing economic policy in anti-policy times, was debated and how things have changed with the advent of the Trump government in particular. There was acknowledgement of some of the flaws of the previous policy world based on liberal norms and rules as well as the ‘organised hypocrisy’ when these are broken on occasion. However, speakers said that it is hard to know what the rules are now as the usual forms of reference have been eroded. “That anchor point has been lost,” said one speaker, acknowledging that a host of social and political issues had contributed to this. Others spoke of ‘technocratic exhaustion’, a disconnect with the working class and a failure to address growing inequality.

Speakers said policy now tends to be more reactive, intuitive and transactional and encompasses a broader set of stakeholders. Communications is more important, for instance, and it is vital that policymakers develop a compelling narrative – often based on case studies – to explain an evidence basis for policy.

The speakers also discussed the growing hostility towards critical policy ideas which makes people afraid to engage in debate. Yet, they said there is room for new ideas and the space from new idea to application is generally much shorter. One speaker spoke about the opportunities in the new world for different ways of doing policy, including more multidisciplinary approaches which have been a feature of the last years.",https://www.gatescambridge.org/about/news/doing-economic-policy-in-disrupted-times/,World
Pakistan reaffirms commitment to bolstering UN peacekeeping mission: PM Shehbaz,"Listen to article

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reaffirmed Pakistan’s enduring commitment to United Nations peacekeeping missions on Thursday, urging the international community to adapt UN operations to meet evolving global challenges.

In a message on the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, He highlighted that more than 235,000 Pakistani troops have served in 48 UN missions over the last seven decades.

A total of 181 Pakistani peacekeepers have lost their lives in the line of duty.

“This day provides an appropriate opportunity to assess the challenges faced by UN peacekeeping forces, such as rising unilateralism, financial constraints, increasing threats to the safety and security of UN peacekeepers, misinformation campaigns targeting UN peace operations, and the impacts of emerging technologies,” He said.

The prime minister called for increased international efforts to support the safety and operational effectiveness of peacekeeping forces worldwide.

Premier Shehbaz also urged stronger backing for the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), which monitors the ceasefire along the Line of Control in the disputed territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

He further said that recent developments in South Asia reinforced the urgency of resolving the Kashmir issue in line with UN Security Council resolutions and the will of the Kashmiri people.

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar echoed the PM's sentiments, noting that UN peacekeeping remains one of the most reliable and cost-effective means to preserve global peace.

"US, India share desire to maintain regional stability and peace","As political tensions in South Asia have simmered down, the US and India reaffirmed their “shared desire to maintain regional stability and peace,” according to a statement by the US State Department.

The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.

On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.

At the height of the conflict, US President Donald Trump warned Pakistan and India of “not doing any trade” if they did not stop fighting.

A date prior, Deputy Secretary Christopher Landau met with Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in Washington, the US State Department said. It noted that Landau “reaffirmed the close partnership between the US and India, a key component of US foreign policy for the 21st century.

“He underscored the importance of fair and reciprocal market access to fostering economic growth and prosperity in both countries,” the statement said.

It added that Landau also emphasised the importance of enhanced cooperation on migration and counternarcotics.

“The Deputy Secretary and the Foreign Secretary also reaffirmed their shared desire to maintain regional stability and peace.”

In a post on X early on Thursday, Landau spoke of his meeting with Misri, saying the US-India relationship is at a “historic zenith and represents a key partnership in the 21st Century.

“We discussed the importance of expanding fair and reciprocal trade, combatting illegal immigration, and expanding counternarcotics cooperation,” he said.

Earlier this month, Trump said that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods while expressing his dissatisfaction with Apple’s plans to invest in India.

New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9 on tariff hikes for major trading partners.

The US is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling some $129 billion in 2024. The trade balance is currently in favour of India, which runs a $45.7bn surplus with the US.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1914082/us-india-share-desire-to-maintain-regional-stability-and-peace,World
Saudi Arabia frees Iran cleric it detained ahead of hajj: Iran media,"TEHRAN: Saudi authorities have released a well-known Iranian religious figure they detained ahead of the annual hajj pilgrimage to the Muslim holy places, Iranian media reported on Thursday.

“Gholamreza Ghasemian has been released and is on his way to Iran after follow-up by Iranian officials,” the ISNA news agency reported.

Iran said it had held consular meetings with the cleric since his arrest on Monday after a video circulated online showing him criticising the Saudi government.

His comments were an allusion to the social reforms implemented in recent years by the kingdom’s de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Riyadh did not confirm Ghasemian’s arrest, but Tehran had expressed concern about the implications for a thaw in relations between the countries since a 2023 rapprochement deal brokered by Beijing.

“Iran in no uncertain terms condemns any attempt to harm Muslim unity, particularly in the spiritual atmosphere of the hajj,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on X late Tuesday.

“We are determined to not allow anyone to sabotage relations with our brotherly neighbours, including the progressive path of Iran and Saudi Arabia.”",https://arynews.tv/saudi-arabia-frees-iran-cleric-detained-ahead-hajj-iran-media/,World

RSF asks International Criminal Court to allow Gazan journalists to participate in its ongoing proceedings,"After filing four complaints with the ICC concerning war crimes committed against journalists in Gaza since October 2023, RSF is resolutely continuing its efforts to bring the issue before international justice. The NGO has submitted several victim participation forms to the ICC so that Gazan journalists can participate in the legal process as recognised victims, not just witnesses.

If granted this status, these journalists would be able to present before the ICC the direct and personal harm they suffered at the hands of Israeli forces in Gaza. Being officially recognised as victims is a first step toward justice, truth, and reparations — and it is an essential step toward protecting press freedom and journalistic integrity in conflict zones.

Since October 2023, Israeli armed forces have killed nearly 200 journalists in Gaza, at least 44 of whom were targeted because of their work, according to RSF data. Not only are foreign journalists barred from entering the blockaded Palestinian territory, but local reporters have watched their homes and newsrooms be destroyed by Israeli airstrikes and have been constantly displaced amidst a devastating humanitarian crisis.",https://rsf.org/en/rsf-asks-international-criminal-court-allow-gazan-journalists-participate-its-ongoing-proceedings,World
Israel claims killing Hamas chief in Gaza strike,"Listen to article

Israel claimed on Wednesday a strike on a hospital in southern Gaza earlier this month killed Mohammad Sinwar, Hamas' Gaza chief and the younger brother of the Palestinian group's deceased leader Yahya Sinwar.

Mohammad Sinwar had been the target of an Israeli strike on the southern Gaza hospital on May 21 and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was likely that he was dead. Hamas has yet to confirm Sinwar's death.

Netanyahu announced that Sinwar had been ""eliminated"" in an address to the Israeli parliament as he listed off names of other Hamas officials that Israel had killed over the past 20 months, including Sinwar's brother Yahya.

""In the last two days we have been in a dramatic turn towards a complete defeat of Hamas,"" he said, adding that Israel was also ""taking control of food distribution"", a reference to a new aid distribution system in Gaza managed by a US-backed group.

Israeli military has intensified its genocide campaign in Gaza after breaking a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in March. The war erupted on October 7, 2023 when Hamas-led fighters killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel and took More than 250 hostages.

Israel's war of Gaza has decimated the coastal territory, killing more than 53,000, according to health officials in Gaza, and displaced over 2 million Palestinians. Gazan health officials have said most of those killed have been civilians – children and women.

Israel says it has killed tens of thousands of Palestinian fighters but has not provided any evidence to support those claims. Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir on May 26 said Hamas had lost many assets, including its command and control centre.

Sinwar was elevated to the top ranks of the Palestinian group last year after Israel killed his brother Yahya in combat. Yahya Sinwar masterminded the October 2023 attack was later named the overall leader of the group after Israel killed his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh in Iran.",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2548373/israel-claims-killing-hamas-chief-in-gaza-strike,World

In the more than two months since Israeli forces resumed military operations in Gaza -- breaking the ceasefire -- international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization said the humanitarian crisis has worsened in the strip.

The resumption of hostilities followed a blockade on all humanitarian aid, which has caused widespread malnutrition and famine-like conditions, according to food security experts at the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative.

As aid finally re-enters Gaza, the Israeli government has claimed Hamas is stealing aid meant for civilians, which Hamas disputes.

Meanwhile, strikes by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) -- in an attempt to target Hamas and to pressure the militant group to release the remaining 58 hostages -- have resulted in the accidental deaths of paramedics and humanitarian workers.

ABC News takes a look at key dates and developments since the temporary ceasefire ended.

Elon Musk announces exit from US government role after breaking with Trump on tax bill,"Elon Musk has announced on social media that he is leaving his role in the Trump administration, a departure the White House confirmed was in process on Wednesday evening.

“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” the billionaire wrote on X, his social media platform.

“The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” he said, referring to his “department of government efficiency.”

A White House official told Reuters it was accurate Musk is leaving the administration and his “off-boarding will begin tonight.”

The departure of a man who once appointed himself Trump’s “first buddy” was quick and unceremonious. Musk did not have a formal conversation with Trump before announcing he was leaving the administration, according to a source with knowledge of the matter, who added that his exit was decided “at a senior staff level”.

Musk, the world’s richest person, has defended his role as an unelected official who was granted unprecedented authority by Trump to dismantle parts of the US government. His 130-day mandate as a special government employee in the Trump administration was set to expire about 30 May.

Both Musk and the administration has said DOGE’s efforts to restructure and shrink the federal government will continue.

Musk has been signalling his departure from Washington, and his commitment to return his business ventures, all week. He sharply criticised Trump’s spending plan, and expressed frustration with the response to the efforts of his signature “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

He criticised the president’s marquee tax bill, calling it too expensive and a measure that would undermine his work to make the government more “efficient”.

“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,” Musk told the Washington Post on Tuesday. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”

He also told the Post that Doge had been turned into a “whipping boy” that was criticised for anything that went wrong in the Trump White House.

Musk had butted heads in private with some cabinet-level officials, and publicly attacked White House trade adviser Peter Navarro as a “moron” for dismissing Musk’s push for “zero tariffs” between the US and Europe.

Musk had also recently expressed frustration to White House officials over a deal between Abu Dhabi and OpenAI, the Sam Altman-led rival to Musk’s own AI company, the New York Times reported. Musk had previously tried to derail the deal unless his company was included in it, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The billionaire’s recent “disillusionment” with politics was also influenced by the failure of his Wisconsin judicial candidate, despite Musk spending $25m on the race, the New York Times reported.

Trump and Doge have managed to cut nearly 12%, or 260,000, of the 2.3 million-strong federal civilian workforce largely through threats of firings, buyouts and early retirement offers, a Reuters review of agency departures found.

Musk’s political activities have drawn protests and some investors have called for Musk to leave his work as Trump’s adviser and manage Tesla more closely.

Having spent nearly $300m to back Trump’s presidential campaign and other Republicans last year, he said earlier this month he would substantially cut his political spending. “I think I’ve done enough,” Musk said at an economic forum in Qatar.

While Musk had told Trump’s advisers this year that he would give $100m to groups controlled by the president’s team before the 2026 midterms, the New York Times reported, the money had not yet come in as of this week.

IUCN at the Glaciers’ Preservation Conference,"In the context of accelerating climate impacts and escalating water insecurity, the High-Level International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation, hosted by the Government of Tajikistan with the support of the United Nations and international partners, takes on urgent significance. The conference is a flagship event of the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation, declared by the UN General Assembly, and aims to raise awareness, foster international cooperation, and advance coordinated responses to glacier retreat.

IUCN welcomes Tajikistan’s leadership in elevating glacier preservation on the international agenda and brings to the conference a strong call for action grounded in science, legal innovation, and inclusive governance. As glaciers recede at unprecedented rates, threatening ecosystems, freshwater supplies, and regional stability, IUCN urges accelerated efforts to integrate glacier protection into national adaptation strategies, international legal frameworks, and cross-border cooperation platforms.

Key messages

Glaciers are critical ecosystems, freshwater reservoirs, and climate regulators that sustain biodiversity and underpin the resilience of entire regions. They should be recognised and protected not only as resources, but as shared natural heritage with ecological, cultural, and geopolitical value.

IUCN calls for stronger legal and institutional frameworks to safeguard glaciers, many of which lie in transboundary basins, through integration into national laws, enhanced monitoring systems, and cross-border governance mechanisms.

Glaciers are disappearing, and with them, vital sources of life and peace. Protecting them is not only a climate imperative, but a moral one.

Activists turn Paris fountain red to denounce Gaza 'bloodbath',"Israel has stepped up a renewed in Gaza, drawing international condemnation

Activists from Oxfam and Amnesty International poured dye into the Fontaine des Innocents in the heart of the French capital, while others held placards saying ""Cease fire"" and ""Gaza: stop the bloodbath"".

""This operation aims to denounce France's slow response to an absolute humanitarian emergency facing the people of Gaza today,"" the activists, which included the French branch of Greenpeace, said in a joint statement.

""France cannot limit itself to mere verbal condemnations,"" said former minister Cecile Duflot, executive director of Oxfam France.

Clemence Lagouardat, who helped coordinate Oxfam's humanitarian response in Gaza, denounced the Israeli blockade of the besieged territory.

""The people in Gaza need everything, it's a matter of survival,"" she told AFP.

The October 7, 2023 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official data.

Militants also abducted 251 people, of whom 57 are still being held in Gaza, including 34 declared dead by the Israeli army.

The Israeli offensive launched in retaliation has killed at least 53,977 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run health ministry, which is considered reliable by the UN.

Israel has now stepped up a renewed campaign to destroy Hamas, drawing international condemnation as aid trickles in following a blockade since early March that has sparked severe food and medical shortages.

""There is a genocide going on and political inaction is becoming a kind of complicity in this genocide,"" said Jean-Francois Julliard, head of Greenpeace France.

""We call on (President) Emmanuel Macron to act with courage, clarity and determination to put an end to this bloodshed.""

The activists urged states ""with influence over Israel"" to press for an immediate and lasting ceasefire, an arms embargo on Israel, the revision of a cooperation agreement between the EU and Israel and other measures.

Slovakia approves sale of brown bear meat to public,"Slovakia approves sale of brown bear meat to public

However, Slovakia's government is forging ahead with the plan and this week announced that meat from culled bears would be sold to the public to prevent waste.

The state-authorised slaughter has been criticised by conservationists and opposition politicians, including in the European Parliament. The brown bear is listed as a ""near threatened"" species in the EU by the World Conservation Union.

Last month, the cabinet authorised a plan to shoot about a quarter of the country's 1,300 brown bears in response to some recent fatal encounters.

The meat of brown bears, a protected species in the EU, could soon be available to eat in Slovakia after the populist government approved plans for sale.

From next week, organisations under the environment ministry can offer the meat for sale, provided all legal and hygiene conditions are met.

State Minister Filip Kuffa said it was wasteful that the animals had previously been sent to carcass disposal facilities.

""We will release every shot animal that meets certain conditions for consumption. Why? Because bear meat is edible,"" he said.

Bears have become a political issue in Slovakia after a rising number of encounters with humans, including fatal attacks.

Slovakia ranks second in Europe, behind Romania which is estimated to have about 13,000 brown bears, for the number of attacks.

The country reported a total of 54 bear attacks from 2000-2020. The average number of attacks has also risen to 10 per year, rough figures suggest.

In April, a man was mauled to death while walking in a forest in Central Slovakia.

Shortly after, Prime Minister Robert Fico announced the cull, saying: ""We can't live in a country where people are afraid to go into the woods.""

He said his government would shoot up to 350 brown bears - a figure equivalent to the species' entire population in Spain.

His government argues that a bear overpopulation problem has led to the attacks.

However environmental groups and critics say the focus should be on prevention.

Michal Wiezik, an ecologist and MEP for the opposition party Progressive Slovakia, told the BBC last month the government's plan was ""absurd"" and it had already failed to limit the number of attacks ""by the unprecedented culling of this protected species.""

Wiezik argued that thousands of encounters a year passed without incident and he hoped the European Commission would intervene.

Miroslava Abelova of Greenpeace Slovakia called the culling plan ""completely reckless,"" accusing the government of ignoring conservation laws and scientific advice.

Brown bears are strictly protected under EU directives, and may only be killed in exceptional cases - such as threats to public safety - when no other alternatives exist.

Bear meat is not commonly eaten in Europe and is considered a delicacy only in a few regions, such as parts of Eastern Europe and the Nordic countries.

In most EU member states, strict hunting rules and the protected status of the bears mean the meat is rarely available. When it is, it is usually from controlled culls or licensed hunting and not commonly found in restaurants or shops.

Where bear meat is consumed, health officials warn of the risk of Trichinella - a parasite that can cause serious illness in humans.

The European Union Food Safety regulation requires all bear meat to be tested for Trichinella larvae before it can be sold and the US' Centre for Disease Control Prevention stipulates an internally cooked temperature of at least 70 degrees centigrade to kill the parasite. Freezing, smoking or drying the meat does not make it safe.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkpy3x3ndo,World

Spain’s Sánchez pressures von der Leyen over Israel’s ‘illegal invasion’ of Gaza,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has urged Ursula von der Leyen to do more to halt Israel's ""illegal invasion"" of Gaza, a day after the European Commission president described Israel's expanded war as ""abhorrent"".

“One year after recognising Palestine as a state, the pain in Gaza is unbearable,"" Sánchez posted on X shortly before his Wednesday in Brussels with von der Leyen. “Spain will continue to raise its voice, stronger than ever, to put an end to the massacre that the world is witnessing today,” he added.

During the meeting, Sánchez shared with von der Leyen his “extreme concern” at the “humanitarian catastrophe” civilians are currently suffering in Gaza, according to a Spanish government press release.

The Spanish leader reiterated the importance of increasing international pressure – via sanctions and an arms embargo – to push Israel to stop its “illegal invasion,” the press release reads.

The meeting comes amid a growing shift in tone among Europe's traditionally strongest supporters of Israel. On Tuesday, von der Leyen accused Israel of using “disproportionate” force against Palestinian civilians and called its expanded war against Hamas in Gaza “abhorrent.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday that Israel's actions in Gaza can ""no longer be justified.""

Spain, meanwhile, has urged the EU to fully suspend the EU's association agreement with Israel. A majority of EU foreign ministers expressed support last week for launching a review of the agreement, which governs trade relations between the bloc and its 31st-largest trading partner.

After Spain’s recognition of Palestinian statehood in 2024, Sánchez has increased diplomatic pressure to force Israel to “comply with international law.” Spanish diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv remain virtually non-existent, and Sánchez has sought Arab League support for two planned proposals on the war for the UN in September.

In the Spanish parliament earlier this month, Sánchez referred to Israel as a ""genocidal state.""

Writers including Zadie Smith sign open letter calling for Gaza ceasefire,"Writers denounce Israel's 'genocidal' actions in Gaza and call for ceasefire

1 day ago Share Save Paul Glynn BBC News Share Save

Getty Images Zadie Smith is known for popular novels including White Teeth and On Beauty

Writers including Zadie Smith, Ian McEwan and Russell T Davies have put their names to an open letter - signed by more than 400 authors and organisations - calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The letter, also signed by Jeanette Winterson, Irvine Welsh, Kate Mosse and Elif Shafak, describes Israel's military campaign in the territory as ""genocidal"". The writers urge people to join them in ""ending our collective silence and inaction in the face of horror"". Israel says it is working to destroy the Palestinian armed group Hamas and get back hostages they have taken. It has strongly denied allegations of genocide, claims which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice.

Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,056 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,901 over the past 10 weeks, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Half a million people face starvation in the coming months, according to an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). Responding to the accusation of genocide made by rights group Amnesty International in December, Israel's foreign ministry described the group's 295-page report as ""entirely false and based on lies"", while the Israeli military said the claims were ""entirely baseless and fail to account for the operational realities"" it faces.

The authors' letter is entitled Writers Demand Immediate Gaza Ceasefire and organised by writers Horatio Clare, Kapka Kassabova and Monique Roffey. It notes that Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, as well as independent experts appointed by the United Nations human rights council, have, it says, ""clearly identified genocide or acts of genocide in Gaza, enacted by the Israel Defence Force and directed by the government of Israel"". The authors call for the ""immediate unrestricted distribution of food and medical aid in Gaza by the UN"", and a ceasefire ""which guarantees safety and justice for all Palestinians, the release of all Israeli hostages, and the release of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners arbitrarily held in Israeli jails"". Sanctions should be imposed, the letter argues, if the Israeli government does not take action. While taking this stand, the authors also used the letter to ""assert without reservation our absolute opposition to and loathing of antisemitism, of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli prejudice"". The letter continues: ""We reject and abhor attacks, hate and violence – in writing, speech and action – against Palestinian, Israeli, and Jewish people in all and any form. We stand in solidarity with the resistance of Palestinian, Jewish, and Israeli people to the genocidal policies of the current Israeli government.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qgpve3qzgo,World

Israel earlier rejected a report in the New York Times that Netanyahu has been threatening to disrupt talks on a nuclear deal between the United States and Iran by striking Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities.

Citing officials briefed on the situation, the newspaper said Israeli officials were concerned that Trump was so eager to reach a deal with Iran that he would allow Tehran to keep its nuclear enrichment facilities, a red line for Israel.

Israel was particularly concerned about the possibility of any interim deal that would allow Iran to maintain its nuclear facilities for months or even years while a final agreement was reached, the paper reported.

U.S. officials were concerned Israel could decide to strike Iran with little warning and said U.S. intelligence estimated that Israel could mount an attack on Iran in as little as seven hours, the paper reported.

Netanyahu's office issued a statement in response to the article which said simply: ""Fake news.""

The New York Times said it stood by the report.

""The New York Times reporting on this matter is thorough and based on discussions with people directly familiar with the matter. We remain confident in what we published,"" a spokesperson said in an email.

The paper said Netanyahu's minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, and David Barnea, head of the foreign intelligence agency Mossad, met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Rome on Friday.

The two then travelled to Washington for a meeting on Monday with CIA director John Ratcliffe, before Dermer met Witkoff again on Tuesday.

One of the main sticking points in the talks between U.S. and Iranian officials has been U.S. insistence that Iran give up its nuclear enrichment facilities, a demand Iran rejects.

On Monday, U.S. Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said she had a ""very candid conversation"" with Netanyahu on the negotiations with Iran.

She said she told the Israeli prime minister that Trump had asked her to convey ""how important it is that we stay united and let this process play out.""

Trump bypassed Israel on his trip to the Middle East this month and has made policy announcements that have shaken Israel's assumptions about its relations with the U.S.

Netanyahu has dismissed speculation about a falling out with the U.S. administration, while Trump has also brushed off any suggestion of a break.

"""Aid must not be weaponized,"" warns Gaza Humanitarian Country Team amid mounting crisis","Statement by the Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory – on Gaza

East Jerusalem and Gaza city, 28 May 2025

Six hundred days on, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is at its darkest point yet. As relentless, deadly bombardment and mass displacement intensify, families are being starved and denied the basic means of survival. Meanwhile, the conditions for us to deliver aid safely and at scale are absent.

After almost 80 days of total blockade by Israeli authorities on any supplies, a trickle has entered. But what made it through falls far short of people’s massive needs. Over the past days, we’ve submitted 900 truckloads for Israeli approval. About 800 were cleared and just over 500 could be offloaded on the Israeli side of Kerem Shalom. We have been able to collect only about 200 on the Palestinian side of the crossing due to insecurity and restricted access.

While letting us bring in some nutrition and medical supplies, as well as flour, Israeli authorities have banned most other items, including fuel, cooking gas, shelter and hygiene products. They also imposed the condition that we could only deliver flour to bakeries and not directly to families. This required people to face large crowds to collect bread from a limited number of bakeries daily. Over the weekend, bakeries that were once supported with humanitarian supplies have shut down due to growing insecurity from large desperate crowds. Food needs to be distributed in multiple forms, and at multiple sites across all Gaza governorates. This is the only way to restore order and prevent mass starvation.

Israel has clear obligations under international humanitarian law. It must treat civilians humanely, with respect for their inherent dignity. It must facilitate the aid that is needed. And it must refrain from forcible transfer. We need predictable and at-scale aid to flow through multiple crossings all the way to communities, as we have done in the past. We need unimpeded access. And we need all humanitarian partners, including UNRWA, to be enabled to provide supplies and, critically, services. Supplies on their own do not amount to an effective humanitarian response. it is essential to ensure the uninterrupted delivery of services across Gaza.

Israeli authorities have undermined the capacity of our teams to deliver genuine, principled humanitarian assistance that would reach the most vulnerable groups. A new militarized distribution system has just been launched. As we have stated, it does not align with humanitarian principles, it puts people at risk, and it will not meet people’s needs, or dignity, across Gaza.

We continue delivering aid where possible, working as a united humanitarian community of UN agencies and non-governmental organizations. Our principles are non-negotiable. We will not participate in any scheme that undermines neutrality, impartiality, or independence. Aid must not be weaponized. We echo the Secretary-General’s calls: a permanent ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and full humanitarian access.

We are ready to save lives. Let us work. The window to prevent famine is closing fast.

Foreign students wary of US as Trump presses ‘dehumanising’ campaign,"US President Donald Trump’s expanding crackdown on elite universities is prompting some international students to abandon applications to campuses in the United States and spreading stress and anxiety among those already enrolled.

The president has upended the country’s reputation among foreign students, who number around one million, as he presses a campaign against US universities he sees as obstructing his “Make America Great Again” populist agenda.

He has blocked Harvard from hosting international scholars in a manoeuvre being challenged legally, targeted non-citizen campus activists for deportation, and most recently, suspended student visa processing across the board.

Harvard applied mathematics and economics student Abdullah Shahid Sial, 20, said the Trump administration’s campaign against US universities which the president accused of being hotbeds of liberal bias and anti-Semitism, had been “dehumanising”.

“It’s really unfortunate that this is the case for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds who came here without any family, and in most cases, haven’t been to the US before,” said Sial, who is from Pakistan and hopes to be able to return to Harvard next academic year.

Sial said he advised acquaintances to have backup plans if US colleges became inaccessible, and that a friend applied to Harvard’s law school, as well as Columbia’s, and two less reputable British institutions, ultimately opting to go to the UK.

“He definitely liked Harvard way more [but] he doesn’t want this amount of uncertainty surrounding his education,” Sial said.

Karl Molden, a Harvard government and classics student from Austria, said Trump’s move to block the university hosting and enrolling foreign students meant he was unsure if he would be able to return after summer vacation.

‘In the dark’

While that decision — affecting some 27 per cent of the overall Harvard population — was paused by a judge pending a hearing Thursday, the move still threw student plans into chaos.

“I kind of figured I would be in the target group of Trump. I’m personally right in the middle of it, so an option for me would be to study abroad … I have applied to study at Oxford because of all the ‘action’ taken by Trump,” said Molden, 21. “It’s just really hard.”

Harvard academics say they have already started to feel the impact of Trump’s vendetta against the school, in feedback from colleagues based outside the United States.

“I’ve already heard this from professors in other countries who say ‘we encourage our best students to go to the United States’,” Harvard professor Ryan Enos told AFP at a noisy rally against Trump’s policies Tuesday, adding “we wonder if we can tell them that anymore.”

The halt to visa processing revealed this week is reportedly to allow for more stringent screening of applicants’ social media and protest activity.

“International students already represent the most tracked and vetted category of nonimmigrants in the United States. It is a poor use of taxpayer dollars,” said the NAFSA Association of International Educators non-profit.

Trump, meanwhile, continued his assault on Harvard, saying university leaders have “got to behave themselves”.

“Harvard is treating our country with great disrespect, and all they’re doing is getting in deeper and deeper,” he said on Wednesday in the White House.

One Spanish student of politics and statistics, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, told AFP she would not be deterred from pursuing her planned year abroad at Columbia University.

“It’s scary, because we think to ourselves that all our activity on social networks could be monitored, for example, if we like pro-Palestinian posts or anti-Trump posts. All of that could see us denied a visa,” she said.

Students due to return to Harvard after the summer break are in limbo pending a ruling on Harvard’s exclusion from the foreign student system.

“I’m completely in the dark,” said 20-year-old Alfred Williamson, a Welsh-Danish physics and government student in his second year at Harvard. “As for my other options, and like all other international students, I’m just clinging on to the hope that Harvard will win this battle against the White House.”

Sial, the Harvard student from Pakistan, said foreign students like him were “made to fight this battle which no one signed up for.” “It’s really unfortunate that it’s come down to that. “",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913897,World
Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia to begin on June 4,"Officials say more than one million Muslim pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in the country.

Saudi Arabia has announced that the annual Hajj pilgrimage will begin on June 4 after observatories confirmed the sighting of the crescent moon.

The announcement was made on Tuesday by the kingdom’s Supreme Court in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.

At a news conference on Monday, Saudi Hajj Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah said more than one million pilgrims from around the world had already arrived in the country.

The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken at least once by all Muslims who are able to.

The pilgrimage occurs annually between the eighth and 13th days of Dhul-Hijjah, the 12th and final month on the Islamic lunar calendar.

Worshippers take part in four days of ceremonies with the high point coming on the second day with mass outdoor prayers on Mount Arafat, the hill where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his last sermon.

Around the world, many Muslims choose to fast on this day.

Many pilgrims also visit the city of Medina, home to the Prophet Muhammad’s tomb and the second holiest site in Islam. While not an official part of the Hajj, visiting Medina remains a significant spiritual experience for many Muslims.

This year, the day of Arafat will fall on June 5, followed by Eid al-Adha on June 6, according to Saudi authorities.

Last year, 1.8 million people took part in the pilgrimage, according to official figures.

During the 2024 Hajj, temperatures soared to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit), and more than 1,300 pilgrims died, raising concerns about the growing risks of extreme heat during the Saudi summer.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/27/hajj-pilgrimage-in-saudi-arabia-to-begin-on-june-4,World
Foreign students seek to quit Harvard amid Trump crackdown,"WASHINGTON: Harvard University has been flooded with requests from foreign students to transfer to other institutions as US President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to ban it from hosting international scholars, a staff member said Wednesday.

“Too many international students to count have inquired about the possibility of transferring to another institution,” Maureen Martin, director of immigration services, wrote in a court filing.

Trump has upended the United States’ reputation among foreign students, who number around one million, as he presses a campaign against US universities he sees as obstructing his “Make America Great Again” populist agenda.

He has blocked Harvard from hosting international scholars in a maneuver being challenged legally, targeted non-citizen campus activists for deportation, and most recently suspended student visa processing across the board.

The president’s crackdown has prompted “profound fear, concern, and confusion” among students and staff at the elite university, which has been “inundated with questions from current international students and scholars about their status and options”, Martin wrote.

More than 27 percent of Harvard’s enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data.

“Many international students and scholars are reporting significant emotional distress that is affecting their mental health and making it difficult to focus on their studies,” Martin wrote in the filing.

Some were afraid to attend their graduation ceremonies this week or had canceled travel plans for fear of being refused re-entry into the United States, she added.

She said that a handful of domestic students at Harvard had also “expressed serious interest” in transferring elsewhere because they did not want to attend a university with no international students.

A judge last week suspended the government’s move to block Harvard from enrolling and hosting foreign students after the Ivy League school sued, calling the action unconstitutional.

A hearing into the case was scheduled for Thursday.

At least 10 foreign students or scholars at Harvard had their visa applications refused immediately after the block on foreign students was announced, including students whose visa applications had already been approved, Martin wrote.

“My current understanding is that the visa applications that were refused or revoked following the Revocation Notice have not yet been approved or reinstated,” despite a judge suspending the move, she said.",https://www.brecorder.com/news/40365293,World
"Exclusive: Iran may pause enrichment for US nod on nuclear rights, release of frozen funds, Iranian sources say","An Iranian newspaper with a cover photo of Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, is seen in Tehran, Iran, April 12, 2025.

Summary Could halt uranium enrichment for a year if US meets certain terms, Iranian official sources say

Terms include recognising Tehran's right to enrich for civilian purposes, releasing frozen Iranian oil revenues

Initial 'political understanding' could lead to broader nuclear accord, sources say

Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if no deal emerges from nuclear negotiations

DUBAI, May 28 (Reuters) - Iran may pause uranium enrichment if the U.S. releases frozen Iranian funds and recognises Tehran's right to refine uranium for civilian use under a ""political deal"" that could lead to a broader nuclear accord, two Iranian official sources said.

The sources, close to the negotiating team, said on Wednesday a ""political understanding with the United States could be reached soon"" if Washington accepted Tehran's conditions. One of the sources said the matter ""has not been discussed yet"" during the talks with the United States.

Sign up here.

The sources told Reuters that under this arrangement, Tehran would halt uranium enrichment for a year, ship part of its highly enriched stock abroad or convert it into fuel plates for civilian nuclear purposes.

A temporary pause to enrichment would be a way to overcome an impasse over clashing red lines after five rounds of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme.

U.S. officials have repeatedly said that any new nuclear deal with Iran - to replace a failed 2015 accord between Tehran and six world powers - must include a commitment to scrap enrichment, viewed as a potential pathway to developing nuclear bombs.

The Islamic Republic has repeatedly denied such intentions, saying it wants nuclear energy only for civilian purposes, and has publicly rejected Washington's demand to scrap enrichment as an attack on its national sovereignty.

In Washington, a U.S. official told Reuters the proposal aired by the Iranian sources had not been brought to the negotiating table to date. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this article.

Iran's semi-official Fars news agency said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei denied Reuters report and said ""enrichment in Iran is a non-negotiable principle.""

The Iranian sources said Tehran would not agree to dismantling of its nuclear programme or infrastructure or sealing of its nuclear installations as demanded by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.

Instead, they said, Trump must publicly recognise Iran's sovereign right to enrichment as a member of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and authorise a release of Iranian oil revenues frozen by sanctions, including $6 billion in Qatar.

Iran has not yet been able to access the $6 billion parked in a Qatar bank that was unfrozen under a U.S.-Iranian prisoner swap in 2023, during U.S. President Joe Biden's administration.

""Tehran wants its funds to be transferred to Iran with no conditions or limitations. If that means lifting some sanctions, then it should be done too,"" the second source said.

The sources said the political agreement would give the current nuclear diplomacy a greater chance to yield results by providing more time to hammer out a consensus on hard-to-bridge issues needed for a permanent treaty.

""The idea is not to reach an interim deal, it would (rather) be a political agreement to show both sides are seeking to defuse tensions,"" said the second Iranian source.

Western diplomats are sceptical of chances for U.S.-Iranian reconciliation on enrichment. They warn that a temporary political agreement would face resistance from European powers unless Iran displayed a serious commitment to scaling back its nuclear activity with verification by the U.N. nuclear watchdog.

Even if gaps over enrichment narrow, lifting sanctions quickly would remain difficult. The U.S. favours phasing out nuclear-related sanctions while Iran demands immediate removal of all U.S.-imposed curbs that impair its oil-based economy.

Asked whether critical U.S. sanctions, reimposed since 2018 when Trump withdrew Washington from the 2015 pact, could be rescinded during an enrichment pause, the first source said: ""There have been discussions over how to lift the sanctions during the five rounds of talks.""

Dozens of Iranian institutions vital to Iran's economy, including its central bank and national oil company, have been sanctioned since 2018 for, according to Washington, ""supporting terrorism or weapons proliferation"".

Iran's clerical establishment is grappling with mounting crises - energy and water shortages, a plunge in the value of its currency, losses among regional militia proxies in wars with Israel, and growing fears of an Israeli strike on its nuclear sites - all exacerbated by Trump's hardline stance.

Trump's revival of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran since he re-entered the White House in January has included tightened sanctions and threats to bomb Iran if current negotiations yield no deal.

Iranian officials told Reuters last week that Tehran's leadership ""has no better option"" than a new deal to avert economic chaos at home that could jeopardise clerical rule.

Nationwide protests over social repression and economic hardship in recent years met with harsh crackdowns but exposed the Islamic Republic's vulnerability to public discontent and drew more Western sanctions over human rights violations.

Mount Everest’s Record-Setting Sherpa Sees a Future of Snowless Mountains and Fewer Guides,"Kami Rita Sherpa, a renowned Nepali mountain guide, completed his 31st climb of Mount Everest on Tuesday, breaking his own record for the most successful trips to the mountain’s peak.

For more than 30 years, Mr. Rita, 55, has helped climbers from all over the world reach the top of the mountain. The New York Times spoke to him about his long career on Wednesday in Kathmandu, hours after his record-breaking climb.

He spoke about the recent surge in luxury expeditions, the use of xenon gas for climbs and how climate change is radically altering the future of the mountain. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Congratulations on your 31st climb. How are you feeling?

I’m proud of this achievement. As a guide, I fulfilled the long-cherished dreams of climbers to stand atop the world’s highest point. I’m happy that I fulfilled their dreams this year as well.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/europe/mount-everest-xenon-sherpa-climate-change.html,World
Member of UK Jewish body resigns over failure to call out Israel on Gaza,"An elected representative on the UK’s largest Jewish body has resigned, saying it had “failed to act morally and failed to represent the increasing diversity of opinion within the British Jewish community” amid growing horror at Israel’s renewed assault on Gaza.

Daniel Grossman, one of 36 elected members of the Board of Deputies facing disciplinary proceedings over their criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza, told a meeting called by the board last weekend that he had “no confidence in the leadership”.

Grossman, 21, a final-year student at Bristol University, was one of three dozen deputies who signed an open letter last month that said “Israel’s soul is being ripped out” by the war in Gaza and that their “Jewish values compel us to stand up and to speak out”.

In response, the board, which consists of more than 300 deputies, opened a disciplinary procedure against all 36 and suspended two deputies. The board’s efforts to shut down debate over the Israeli government’s actions has prompted criticism and discomfort among a significant and growing proportion of British Jews.

Grossman told the Guardian: “It’s very simple: they are refusing to explicitly and publicly condemn Israel’s genocidal assault in Gaza and to criticise the [Israeli] government for abandoning the hostages, who have been in captivity for far too long.

“Increasing numbers of people are recognising that Israel’s actions in Gaza cannot be justified as purely self-defence. They seemingly want to declare a perpetual war against Palestinian civilians with the goal of ethnically cleansing them from the Gaza Strip.”

View image in fullscreen Daniel Grossman: ‘The diversity of opinion in the Jewish community is becoming increasingly clear.’

Grossman said that the past 19 months since Hamas’s horrific attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 had “definitely been a journey for me”. He grew up in a mainstream Jewish community, with strong emotional and familial connections with Israel, but it had become “increasingly clear that the way the Israeli government is acting is not acceptable by any measure”.

The response to his resignation had been more supportive than he expected, he said. “More people were sympathetic than I expected, and it has genuinely astonished me. Lots of these people may not feel able to speak out themselves, they might find it difficult with friends or family. But people have reached out to me.

“A huge shift is happening. The diversity of opinion in the Jewish community is becoming increasingly clear,” Grossman said, yet the board had tried to “stifle dissent”.

Although younger Jews were more open to criticising the actions of the Israeli government, there was not a clear generational divide, he said. “My 89-year-old grandmother, who was a refugee during the Holocaust, said I had done the right thing and she is proud of me for speaking up.”

Grossman said he was on the political left among British Jews, but added: “This issue is touching people across the political spectrum. A lot of people are waking up.”

A spokesperson for the Board of Deputies said: “Daniel’s term as a deputy was due to end in a few weeks with him having been replaced by another representative from the Union of Jewish Students. We wish him well with his future endeavours.”

Its investigation into the 36 signatories to the open letter is expected to conclude in the next few weeks.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/28/member-of-uk-jewish-board-of-deputies-resigns-over-failure-to-call-out-israel-on-gaza,World
