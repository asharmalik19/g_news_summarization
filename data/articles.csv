"Over 184 Million Passwords From Apple, Microsoft, Google, Others Leaked In Massive Data Breach","In yet another huge data breach, a massive number of account credentials such as logins and passwords to email and bank accounts have been exposed online. Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler has in a report disclosed that he found a huge internet database of over 184 million unique account credentials.

Fowler discovered a file containing usernames, passwords, emails, and URLs for numerous apps and websites, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and others. Not just that, credentials for government portals, health platforms, and bank and financial accounts were also included in the database.

The most dangerous bit was that there was no encryption on the file.

"Oppo A3 Price Dropped in Pakistan; Save Up to Rs 3,000 on 6/128GB Variant","Usama Rasool May 27, 2025

The Chinese phone maker has quietly given a price cut to one of its entry-level devices in Pakistan. Oppo A3 (6/128GB) is now offering users a discount of up to Rs 3,000, making the phone a more attractive option in the competitive budget segment.





The Oppo A3 was previously available at Rs 43,000, but with the official price cut, you can now purchase it for Rs. 39,999 across Pakistani stores. This should raise the phone’s value proposition in the market, putting it back in the spotlight. Here’s a brief overview of all its specifications.

Oppo Latest Budget Model Price in Pakistan 2025

This device has a Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip inside, which provides the Oppo A3 with 4G connectivity and decent processing speeds. It’s capable enough to glide through your daily workloads without breaking a sweat, and 6 GB RAM should be plenty for light multitasking.





There’s a 6.67” IPS screen on the front of Oppo latest budge model that serves you a standard 720p resolution and a 1000 nits brightness level. One of its better qualities is a 90Hz refresh rate for fluid animations and visuals. This phone also has a 180Hz touch response rate and reinforced Panda Glass.

The handsets launched in the budget market usually cut some corners to achieve lower prices. Oppo A3 is laced with compromises in the camera department. There’s only a 5 MP camera on the front, which is usually considered subpar within this price range.





We get two other sensors on the back: one is a 50 MP primary, and the other is an unspecified assistive lens with an LED flash on the side. There is a fingerprint reader beneath the volume key, and the phone powers everything up using a 5100mAh battery under the hood.

New Realme 4G Mobile 2025 Price in Pakistan

Its chassis is made of die-cast aluminum with a plastic back and glass front. It’s rated IP64 for dust and splash resistance, which is pretty decent for a phone at this price. Note 60’s display has reinforced glass that makes it safe from scratches and fall damage.





Speaking of displays, the new Realme 4G mobile carries a massive 6.74” IPS LCD with a waterdrop notch. There’s only a 5MP front camera, so you might need to get comfortable with low-res selfies. A 560 nits typical brightness with 720p resolution is modest, but we do find its 90Hz refresh rate commendable.

It is presented with two camera lenses on the back, but there’s only one usable sensor here with a 32MP resolution, which can do 1080p 30FPS videos. The other lens is only for decorative purposes. This model is 7.8mm thin, a quality that isn’t easy to come by on an entry-level device.





You get a massive 5000mAh cell inside this phone, providing a decent one-day backup. The only caveat is the slow 10W charging. It might need more than two hours to refill. The Note 60 carries a weak Unisoc T612 processor, running a system with Android 14 x Realme UI 5 out of the box.

Xiaomi Just Took Aim at Apple and Tesla -- And It's Not Backing,"Xiaomi (XIACY, Financial) just fired a shot at two of the world's most valuable companies — and it wasn't subtle. At a splashy product launch in China, CEO Lei Jun unveiled the 15S Pro smartphone, priced at just 5,499 yuan ($764), making it eligible for a government subsidy. That's well below the iPhone 16 Pro's 7,999 yuan starting point — a critical price edge in a country where the 6,000 yuan threshold unlocks discounts for consumers. More importantly, Lei claimed Xiaomi's homegrown chip, the Xring O1, beats Apple's (AAPL, Financial) A18 Pro in key areas like thermal performance during gaming. It took four years and $1.87 billion to develop — and it's already in mass production using the same 3nm process that powers Apple's flagship.

But phones are just the warm-up act. Xiaomi's real ambition might be on four wheels. After undercutting Tesla (TSLA, Financial) last year with its SU7 sedan — priced $4,000 lower than the Model 3 — the company is now preparing to launch the YU7 SUV in July. Lei didn't reveal pricing, but he did drop a few details: the YU7 will feature chips from Qualcomm and Nvidia, advanced driver assist, and up to 835 km of range. Still, the road hasn't been smooth. A fatal SU7 crash triggered tighter ad rules on driver-assist features. Despite that, Xiaomi delivered 28,000 vehicles in April and shows no signs of slowing down.

Investors will get their next read on May 27, when Xiaomi reports Q1 results. Last year, it posted record revenue and profit, with nearly 42% of sales coming from overseas markets. The stock is already up over 50% year-to-date — and with Lei pledging 200 billion yuan in R&D through 2031, the market may be starting to realize: this isn't just a phone company anymore. Xiaomi wants to play in every arena Apple and Tesla dominate — and it's bringing its own chips, cars, and pricing power to the fight.",https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2889911/xiaomi-just-took-aim-at-apple-and-tesla-and-its-not-backing-down,Technology
"Xiaomi Poco F7 Clears NBTC & SDPPI Certifications, Points to Broader Asian Launch","Usama Rasool May 28, 2025

Xiaomi Poco F7 is inching closer to its global debut. Following earlier FCC clearance, the phone has now passed certifications in both Thailand and Indonesia. These are clear signs that its launch is just around the corner. Here’s what we know so far.





The company has yet to announce the official launch date for the global Poco F7. We recently found this device on Thailand’s regulatory site called the “NBTC,” and now the same model has surfaced on the Indonesian SDPPI database as well.

Xiaomi Poco New Model 2025 Price in Pakistan

After getting certifications from both of these regulators, it’s only a matter of days before Poco F7 debuts in the global market. Xiaomi Poco F7 can be identified with the model code “25053PC47G” on both certifications. The letter ”G” hints at the phone’s global trajectory.





NBTC confirms that the Xiaomi Poco new model has 5G antenna bands, and it supports NR (New Radio) connections. Sadly, the regulator’s documentation lacks the specifics regarding the Poco F7. You can also find this device on the SDPPI database, again, with limited information.

Apart from these two certifiers, we’ve found Poco F7 (Global) on Singapore’s IMDA, Europe’s EEC, and USA’s FCC databases, pointing out several regions where the phone is supposed to launch in the upcoming days. If the rumors are to be believed, you might find a familiar device rebranded as Poco F7 in the global markets.





Poco F7 might show up on the global stage as a name-swapped Redmi Turbo 4 Pro with a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chip, 12GB or 16GB RAM, and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. Xiaomi often passes on the Redmi Turbo models to the global markets as rebranded Poco devices, and this handset is no different.





Redmi Turbo 4 Pro claims to have an HDR brightness of 3200 nits. It carries an AMOLED 6.83” screen with 1.5k resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. There is also a massive 7550mAh battery inside this new device, which you can recharge at 90W.

"Katz Stealer Malware Targets Major Web Browsers, Crypto Wallets","A newly identified malware-as-a-service (MaaS) threat, known as Katz Stealer, is actively targeting users of popular web browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Mozilla Firefox. The aim: to steal sensitive data such as login credentials, cookies, session tokens, and cryptocurrency wallet information. The malware has been observed exploiting vulnerabilities in over 78 Chromium and Gecko-based browsers, making it a significant concern for both individual users and organizations.







Katz Stealer Infection Chain and Evasion Techniques

Katz Stealer uses a multi-stage infection method that starts with the delivery of extensively obfuscated JavaScript code hidden inside GZIP files. When executed, this code runs a base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads a.NET-based loader payload. This loader injects the stealer into legal processes using techniques such as process hollowing, allowing it to run undetected.

To avoid discovery, Katz Stealer employs extensive evasion measures such as geofencing to prohibit execution in specific zones, virtual machine detection via BIOS queries and system uptime checks, and sandbox evasion by evaluating screen resolution. It also exploits trusted Windows tools such as cmstp.exe to circumvent User Account Control (UAC), granting elevated capabilities without warning users.

Data Exfiltration Capabilities

Once active, Katz Stealer establishes a persistent connection to its command and control (C2) server, downloading further payloads and injecting them into browser processes to harvest sensitive data. Notably, it can bypass Chrome’s app-bound encryption by extracting decryption keys from Local State files, saving them as plaintext for exfiltration.







Beyond browsers, the malware targets a wide range of applications and platforms, including:

Cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Exodus)

Communication platforms like Discord and Telegram

Email clients such as Outlook and Windows Live Mail

Gaming platforms like Steam

VPN setups, FTP clients, and Ngrok tokens

Its ability to extract data from such a diverse set of applications underscores the malware’s versatility and the breadth of its threat.",https://www.techjuice.pk/katz-stealer-malware-targets-major-web-browsers-crypto-wallets/,Technology

Users are reporting bootlooping after the latest Samsung Galaxy A56 update,"According to some Samsung Community posts, the latest software update for the Galaxy A56 is causing some bootloop issues. The update itself isn't big and brings some minor improvements to the software experience, with the most notable one being the ability to launch Gemini by a long press of the power button.

In any case, after installing the update, some users are reporting bootloops, essentially bricking their phones. The bad news is that Samsung has yet to acknowledge the issue, but the good news is that the workaround is very easy. You just have to power off the phone, remove the SIM card and start up the phone again. Once the OS boots, insert the SIM card.

Interestingly enough, the update reached the Galaxy A26 and A36, but no such issues have been reported.

Leak reveals details of Galaxy A57's Exynos chipset,"Leak reveals details of Galaxy A57's Exynos chipset The Galaxy A57 will be powered by the Exynos 1680 processor according to a leak. (Image source: Samsung) The Galaxy A57 isn't expected to arrive until 2026. Nevertheless, details of the phone, specifically its processor, have surfaced revealing its GPU. Habeeb Onawole, 🇪🇸 🇵🇹 ... 🇮🇹 🇳🇱 🇫🇷 🇵🇱 🇷🇺 🇭🇺 🇨🇳 🇸🇪

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types Samsung's Galaxy A56 is just a couple of months old but news of its successor which should launch as the Galaxy A57, has already begun to surface. Not expected to arrive until 2026, a report about the processor that will power the next-gen Galaxy A smartphone has appeared online. Like the Galaxy A56 (available on Amazon for $409.99), the Galaxy A57 will launch with a new processor called the Exynos 1680 according to GalaxyClub. The source says the new processor, which has the model number ''S5E8865'' and the codename ''Terra'', is already being tested.

There are not a lot of confirmed details yet, so there's a bit of speculation such as the processor having an Xclipse GPU. The Exynos 1680 is expected to have an Xclipse 550 GPU which should be more powerful than the Xclipse 540 GPU of the Exynos 1580 processor that powers the Galaxy A56. With respect to the CPU, there are no details yet. However, we won't be surprised if Samsung opts for the Cortex-A720 and Cortex-A520 again just as it did with the Exynos 1580. Although, we can expect a higher clock speed and or cluster arrangement. The Exynos 1580 has a tri-cluster made up of a 1x Cortex-A720 clocked at 2.9GHz, 3x Cortex-A720 clocked at 2.6GHz, and 4x Cortex-A520 clocked at 1.9GHz. The Exynos 1580 was a big step up from the Galaxy A55's Exynos 1480 processor but it remains to be seen if the Exynos 1680 will continue that trend or be a minor upgrade over its predecessor.

"Mistral Releases Devstral, an Open-Source LLM for Software Engineering Agents","Mistral AI announced the release of Devstral, a new open-source large language model developed in collaboration with All Hands AI. Devstral is aimed at improving the automation of software engineering workflows, particularly in complex coding environments that require reasoning across multiple files and components. Unlike models optimized for isolated tasks such as code completion or function generation, Devstral is designed to tackle real-world programming problems by leveraging code agent frameworks and operating across entire repositories.

Devstral is part of a new class of agentic language models, which are designed not just to generate code, but to take contextual actions based on specific tasks. This agentic structure allows the model to perform iterative modifications across multiple files, conduct explorations of the codebase, and propose bug fixes or new features with minimal human intervention. These capabilities are aligned with the demands of modern software engineering, where understanding project structure and dependencies is as important as writing syntactically correct code.

According to Mistral's internal evaluations, Devstral achieves a performance score of 46.8% on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark composed of 500 manually screened GitHub issues. This score places it ahead of previously published open-source models, surpassing them by over six percentage points. The benchmark tests not only whether models can generate valid code but whether that code actually resolves a documented issue in a real project. When compared on the same OpenHands framework, Devstral outperforms significantly larger models such as Deepseek-V3-0324, which has 671 billion parameters, and Qwen3 232B-A22B, highlighting the model’s efficiency.

Devstral was fine-tuned from the Mistral Small 3.1 base model. Before training, the vision encoder was removed, resulting in a fully text-based model optimized for code understanding and generation. It supports a long context window of up to 128,000 tokens, allowing it to ingest large codebases or extended conversations in a single pass. With a parameter size of 24 billion, Devstral is also relatively lightweight and accessible for developers and researchers. The model can run locally on a consumer-grade GPU such as the NVIDIA RTX 4090, or on Apple Silicon devices with 32GB of RAM. This lowers the barrier to entry for teams or individuals working in constrained environments or handling sensitive codebases.

Mistral has made Devstral available under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, which allows both commercial and non-commercial use, as well as modifications and redistribution. The model can be downloaded through various platforms including Hugging Face, LM Studio, Ollama, and Kaggle. It is also accessible via Mistral’s own API under the identifier devstral-small-2505.

Community feedback reflects a mix of excitement and critical evaluation. Product Builder, Nayak Satya commented:

Another promising enhancement from Mistral. This company is silently building some great additions for AI space. Europe is not far behind in AI when Mistral stands tall. Meantime can it be added inside VS studio or any modern IDE'S folks?

On Reddit’s r/LocalLLaMA, users praised Devstral’s performance, user Coding9 posted:

It works in Cline with a simple task. I can't believe it. Was never able to get another local one to work. I will try some more tasks that are more difficult soon!

Although Devstral is released as a research preview, its deployment marks a step forward in the practical application of LLMs to real-world software engineering. Mistral has indicated that a larger version of the model is already in development, with more advanced capabilities expected in upcoming releases. The company is inviting feedback from the developer community to further refine the model and its integration into software tooling ecosystems.",https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/05/mistral-devstral-agentic/,Technology
Nintendo to hold another Direct around Switch 2 launch: report,"Nintendo is reportedly planning to hold a Direct live stream around the launch of the Switch 2 gaming console on June 5.

Journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe, who has previously shared credible details about Nintendo’s plans, made the claim during a live stream with a foreign media outlet.

According to Lippe, the company is likely to hold another Direct around the launch of the Switch 2 gaming console on June 5.

The Kyoto-based company has held a Nintendo Direct every year since the format was started in 2012.

The events are generally aimed at new announcements across multiple titles, while there have been Directs, which focused on single titles such as Smash Bros. Ultimate or Pokémon.

There have not been any official statements from the company on the claim about its rumoured Direct.

Android 16’s “Live Updates” Gets Real-Time Spotlight on One UI 8,"Android 16 is on the horizon, and Google has already offered a sneak peek into one of its standout features, “Live Updates.”







Announced during the developer keynote at Google I/O 2025, this new system enables users to view real-time updates from supported apps directly on their lock screen, Always On Display (AOD), notification panel, and status bar, without unlocking their devices.

This feature aims to redefine how users stay updated on live tasks, like food deliveries or ride progress, in the most seamless and accessible way possible.

Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra Leads the Demo

As part of the early showcase, Samsung was front and center. A demo running Android 16 integrated with One UI 8.0 on the Galaxy S25 Ultra highlighted the Live Updates system in action. A snapshot from the event showed the progress of an Uber Eats order displayed on the bottom of the lock screen, giving users real-time tracking from order placement to delivery completion, all without needing to unlock the phone or open the app.







The Now Bar, featured prominently in the demo, serves as the visual space where these updates live and evolve as events progress. Users can even interact directly with the update, such as calling, messaging, or tipping the delivery driver, all from the lock screen.

Early Rollout and App Support

While the initial focus is on food delivery, ride-hailing, and navigation apps, Google has hinted that broader app support may follow. App developers could gain access to an API allowing them to plug into this live experience.

Google also noted that this feature would be part of the core Android 16 system, with manufacturers like Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Vivo expected to customize their own Live Update experiences.

The innovation doesn’t stop at smartphones. Google announced that it will roll out Live Updates on smartwatches next year, expanding the interactive ecosystem beyond handheld devices.

Alongside this feature, Android 16 is also placing heavy emphasis on user privacy improvements. Meanwhile, One UI 8.0 beta testing for Samsung users is expected to begin shortly, giving Galaxy S25 Ultra owners an early experience of what Android 16 truly feels like.

With Android 16 and the integration of “Live Updates,” everyday smartphone interactions are becoming more intuitive, immersive, and responsive. The wait won’t be long, and if you’re a Samsung user, you’re likely first in line.",https://www.techjuice.pk/android-16s-live-updates-gets-real-time-spotlight-on-one-ui-8/,Technology
NASA scientists told 'get back to the office'. Space exploration lab calls time on remote working,"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has called time on remote working, telling its employees they will be required to return to the office full time.

Return to the lab

""We are likely facing a very tough budget environment — this is a time to have all hands on deck and to do everything we can to ensure the best possible future for the Lab,"" JPL said in an email to colleagues.

""We weighed this decision carefully. As we return, we will focus on cultivating relationship-building, mentoring, spontaneous interactions, and real-time problem-solving — all of which drive our most innovative work and will prepare us to meet the demands of today’s dynamic environment.""

The email sent to JPL employees also laid out the timeframe for the full return to the office, stating that those who don't return to full-time office work will lose their jobs.

""General telework employees will have until Monday, August 25 (2025), to fully return to their assigned work location, and remote telework employees — both in and outside of California — will have until Monday, October 27.

""Note that for those who can, we encourage returning to fully onsite work sooner than the required dates. Although rare exceptions are possible, employees who do not return by their required date will be considered to have resigned.""

The email said that exceptions to fully-onsite work may be made, but that they will be ""extremely rare"".

"With iOS 19 on the way, Apple looks toward mobile gaming","With Apple’s flagship Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event a few weeks away, the company is signaling that it’s paying attention to the opportunity of mobile gaming.

Apple already has a subscription-based Arcade product for iOS, which gives users access to various mobile games, including cult-classic indie games like Stardew Valley. But per a Digital Trends report, the company is taking things a step further by acquiring its first game studio, RAC7, which makes the hit Apple Arcade game Sneaky Sasquatch.

Apple joins some other seemingly unlikely suspects in their investment in mobile gaming — Netflix, for example, acquired several gaming studios after launching Netflix Games in 2021, which makes cloud mobile gaming available to Netflix subscribers.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg confirmed a 9to5Mac report that Apple is developing a dedicated gaming app for iOS 19. The app will reportedly replace the Game Center app and integrate with Apple Arcade to host features like gaming leaderboards, recommendations, challenges, and social features. The new app could also integrate into iMessage or FaceTime to facilitate remote multiplayer gaming.

Apple’s additional investment in mobile gaming comes at a time when cloud gaming — which allows users to stream games to their devices without downloading massive files — is on the rise. Microsoft has been a leader in this shift with its Xbox Cloud Gaming offerings.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/with-ios-19-on-the-way-apple-looks-toward-mobile-gaming/,Technology
"Opera teases Neon, its first agentic browser - join the waitlist to try it","Opera / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET

Opera has announced that it will release one of the first agentic browsers. Called Neon, this browser will serve two purposes: use AI to automatically perform tasks for users, and serve as an AI playground for future development.

Also: Opera's Android browser just got a major tab management upgrade

The purpose of an agentic browser is to use AI agents to understand user intent, automate complex tasks, and act on behalf of the user. Agentic browsers move from being a passive tool to access information to an active digital assistant.

Not the first Neon

This isn't the first time Opera has released a browser called Neon. Nearly a decade ago, the company released a concept browser that was intended to serve as an experimental platform for testing new ideas and user interface innovations.

Also: The best secure browsers for privacy: Expert tested

This time around it's all about AI, and Opera Neon will be able to work with you or for you to help you get things done.

The announcement by Opera comes on the heels of Google's I/O, where they announced Shopping Mode for Chrome, which uses AI to tie into a user's searches. Opera Neon will go farther than that.

According to Henrik Lexow, senior AI product director at Opera, during the Opera Neon press briefing:

""We're at a point where AI can fundamentally change the way we use the internet and perform all sorts of tasks in the browser. Opera Neon brings this to our users' fingertips. We see it as a collaborative platform to shape the next chapter of agentic browsing together with our community.""

New AI agent

Like the current iteration of Opera, Neon will include a standard AI tool that allows users to chat, search the web, get answers, and access most of the functions found in traditional AI tools. Along with that, there'll be the new AI agent (which was previously showcased as ""Browser Operator""), which allows users to automate routine web tasks, such as filling out forms, making hotel reservations, and shopping.

Also: Arc reinvented browsing for the better - and that was apparently the problem

Another very interesting aspect of Opera Neon is the employment of AI agents that function in a virtual machine -- hosted in the cloud. Those agents can continue working for a user even after they've gone offline. For example, you can ask the browser to create a game. Opera Neon will research, design, and build it even after you've stepped away. With this powerful tool, users can even ask the AI agents to simultaneously make multiple requests, so Opera Neon is a true agentic multitasking tool in web browser form.

Release date

No release date has been announced, but you can sign up for a wait list to be informed as soon as Opera Neon is available.

The war on links escalates with Firefox's experimental AI previews,"Mozilla's Firefox has joined Chrome, Edge and other browsers in offering AI-powered overviews, but this time with a twist. The latest version lets you use a keyboard shortcut to open a pop-up that previews a link's contents when you hover over it from any web page. It's a new way that AI is being integrated into browsers that may help users but hurt publishers.

To try the new feature you need the latest Firefox release channel version 139.0. Within the settings under ""Firefox Labs,"" simply turn on Link Previews. ""After enabling, use the Alt+Shift keyboard shortcut when hovering over a link to see the previews in action,"" Mozilla writes.

Once turned on, you can hover your mouse over a link on any webpage and a vertical window will pop up showing an image on top, the publisher's link and a quick summary. Below that are AI-generated ""key points"" that provide further information. Mozilla previously said that it uses the SmolLM2-360M language model from Hugging Face, on-device with Reader's View content to ensure privacy.

"Lung, Diaphragm Protective Ventilation Strategy Cuts Kids' Wean Time","Key Takeaways Using a lung and diaphragm protective ventilation strategy guided by a computerized decision support tool during the acute phase of ventilation shortened the duration of weaning, a pediatric phase II trial showed.

Ventilation with the REDvent computerized decision support tool plus esophageal manometry appeared to raise the rate of first spontaneous breathing trial success and shorten overall ventilation duration.

The trial was underpowered for hard clinical endpoints.

Using a lung and diaphragm protective ventilation strategy guided by a computerized decision support (CDS) tool during the acute phase of ventilation shortened the duration of weaning, a pediatric phase II trial showed.

The intervention increased the proportion of children who passed their standardized spontaneous breathing trial or were extubated on the day of that first try to 55% compared with 39% with usual care (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.01-2.77, P=0.045), Robinder Khemani, MD, MsCI, of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and colleagues reported in NEJM Evidence.

Along with this success for the primary endpoint, ventilation with the REDvent CDS tool plus esophageal manometry appeared to raise the rate of first spontaneous breathing trial success and shorten overall ventilation duration, although these secondary endpoints were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

""These key markers highlight the potential for REDvent, or other similar programs, to facilitate a more efficient liberation from mechanical ventilation,"" according to an accompanying editorial.

""It seems reasonable to speculate that CDS could function as a tool to constantly remind clinicians to avoid over-support and keep weaning toward extubation,"" with ""promise for improving outcomes,"" added editorialists Yu Inata, MD, PhD, of Texas Children's Hospital North Austin Campus, and Muneyuki Takeuchi, MD, PhD, of the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center in Osaka, Japan.

The trial showed similar clinical outcomes between groups but was underpowered for ventilator-free days and hard outcomes. ""The ultimate clinical impact should be evaluated in larger phase III trials,"" the researchers noted.

Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) guidelines recommend limiting plateau pressure, avoiding supraphysiological tidal volume, and following the ARDS Network parameters for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). However, this isn't often followed in clinical practice.

Too much respiratory effort can injure both the lung and the diaphragm, whereas too much ventilator support with unduly high PEEP can lead to diaphragm atrophy, which in turn prolongs mechanical ventilation and can increase mortality, Khemani and colleagues noted.

They aimed to provide recommendations that clinicians could integrate with their expertise during the acute period when weaning decisions are being made.

The phase II trial randomly assigned the ventilation strategy for 248 children at a single center who had ARDS from October 2017 through March 2024.

A second point of randomization to either REDvent or usual care at the weaning phases of ventilation for children who failed their first spontaneous breathing trial didn't show any difference in outcome, ""underscoring the importance of early diaphragm-protective intervention,"" the editorialists wrote.

REDvent -- Real-Time Effort Driven Ventilator Management -- involved respiratory therapists adjusting ventilator settings every 4 hours based on the patient's pressure rate product as a measure of breathing effort derived from esophageal manometry. The CDS tool also generated oxygenation recommendations aligned with the ARDS Network low-PEEP/fraction of inspired oxygen table and lung-protective inspiratory pressure limits while maintaining the pressure rate product within a diaphragm-protective range, the editorialists noted.

The intervention cut median time from intubation to passing the spontaneous breathing trial by nearly 1 day (3.83 vs 4.75 days) and duration of ventilation among survivors by 14 hours (5.0 vs 5.6 days).

""These key markers highlight the potential for REDvent, or other similar programs, to facilitate a more efficient liberation from mechanical ventilation,"" Inata and Takeuchi wrote.

""Notably, the benefit of the REDvent intervention may have been greater in patients with milder ARDS, that is, patients with an oxygenation index (OI) lower than 8 (the OI range is dynamic, with a healthy lung at about 2 to 3 and, in patients with severe [pediatric ARDS], 16 or greater) than in those with OI greater than or equal to 8, although a subgroup analysis found no interaction between OI and REDvent use on the outcome of time to passing the [spontaneous breathing trial],"" they added.

""This suggests that excessive ventilator support, particularly in those with milder disease, may delay weaning,"" the editorialists wrote.

Because the trial used a bundle of interventions, it wasn't possible to separate out the impact of REDvent's algorithm-driven recommendations as being superior to the average clinician's decision-making rather than just being due to the labor-intensive adjustments or some other factor.

""[D]eveloping a closed-loop system with autonomous ventilator adjustment could potentially enhance the applicability of these algorithms by reducing staff workloads,"" the editorialists noted. ""Such advancements, if they could be reduced to safe and effective practice, could enable lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation with minimal human intervention, even when expert personnel are not available.""

Fake Bitdefender Site Spreads Trio of Malware Tools,"A spoofed Bitdefender website has been used in a malicious campaign to distribute VenomRAT and two other malware tools, giving attackers deep access to victims’ systems.

The fake site, titled DOWNLOAD FOR WINDOWS, mimics Bitdefender’s legitimate antivirus download page but redirects visitors to malicious files hosted on Bitbucket and Amazon S3.

The downloaded package contains an executable named StoreInstaller.exe, which initiates the infection process. Researchers found this file bundled with code from three separate malware families: VenomRAT, StormKitty and SilentTrinity.

Modular Malware for Maximum Exploitation

According to DomainTools, who uncovered the campaign, it demonstrates a layered approach to compromise with each tool playing a distinct role:

VenomRAT ensures remote and persistent access

StormKitty gathers credentials and crypto wallet data

SilentTrinity facilitates stealthy exfiltration and long-term control

Together, these components allow attackers to move swiftly while remaining hidden.

The use of SilentTrinity and StormKitty, both open-source frameworks, suggests the attackers are targeting users not just for immediate gain but for prolonged exploitation or resale of access.

VenomRAT has roots in the Quasar RAT project and supports keylogging, credential theft and remote command execution (RCE).

The malware samples tied to this campaign share consistent configurations, particularly the reuse of command-and-control (C2) IPs like 67.217.228[.]160:4449 and 157.20.182[.]72:4449.

Analysts traced additional VenomRAT samples and IPs through matching RDP configurations, revealing further infrastructure likely managed by the same threat actor.

Fake Login Pages Pose Additional Risks

In addition to the spoofed antivirus site, researchers identified related phishing domains impersonating banks and IT services. These include:

idram-secure[.]live, spoofing Armenian IDBank

royalbanksecure[.]online, mimicking Royal Bank of Canada

dataops-tracxn[.]com, posing as a Microsoft login portal

The infrastructure behind these domains overlaps in timing and setup, reinforcing the assessment of a coordinated, financially motivated campaign.

Growing Use of Open-Source Malware

The attackers’ reliance on open-source tools shows how accessible cybercrime has become. By repurposing existing frameworks, they can quickly assemble flexible, effective malware kits. While this can help defenders recognize patterns, it also increases the speed and scale of potential attacks.

DomainTools researchers emphasize vigilance and encourage users to verify download sources, avoid entering credentials on untrusted sites and remain cautious with email links or attachments.",https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/fake-bitdefender-site-spreads/,Technology
Google’s AI-Powered Smart Home ‘Automation Creation Tool’ is Almost Here,"Google’s I/O developer conference was last week and the big takeaway for those who didn’t tune in was: AI. AI in search, AI in videos, AI in near everything. That also means, AI in the home, and Google had a bit to dish on how Gemini is going to be incorporated into its smart home offerings as well.

Last year, Google opened its Home APIs to developers looking to create bespoke integrations with Google Home, and that netted some interesting applications from both ADT and Eve, as well as Hisense in more recent times.

Related News: Hisense Integrates Google APIs into Its Smart Home ConnectLife App

Giving a peak behind the scenes, Google has also announced that new integrations with popular smart home companies such as Yale, Cync and First Alert are on the horizon.

At Google I/O 2025, however, the company stated that it will be directly incorporating its Gemini AI into its Home APIs soon, thereby “bringing the best of Google’s AI” directly to homeowners.

Gemini Home AI Fast Becoming a Reality

Back in November 2024, Google showcased a limited application of Gemini’s potential to become an automation creation tool by opening it up to select Nest Aware Plus subscribers.

Using ‘Help Me Create,’ users could request bespoke automations for their Nest systems via voice, and the system would create an automation based off their request.

Now, that capability is expanding across the home platform, though it’s not yet ready for full deployment, according to Google.

By incorporating the Gemini AI into its Home platform, Google is aiming to make it simple for homeowners to build their own custom automations, without the need of any programming knowledge.

The idea is not too dissimilar from what smart home company Nice is doing with its own AI voice assistant. Released last year on its NiceOS 8.9 update, the company has stated the goal of using AI in its systems is to simplify automation for the homeowner.

According to Nice, it views the simplification of automation creation as a boon to integrators, minimizing service calls to fine-tune existing automations and also minimizing the programming knowledge required to design bespoke smart home systems on its platform.

Integrated into Google Home, Gemini will reportedly analyze home devices and usage patterns to then offer automations it can develop for the homeowner. Additionally, Gemini, much like in the initial Nest debut, users can converse with Gemini to create their own automations based off personal requests.

Google has also stated that Gemini’s integration into the Home platform will allow for more contextual automations as well, such as forgoing turning on the sprinklers if it happened to have rained the day prior.

Simpler Smart Home Automations a Goal Across Both Pro and DIY Channels

While still new in the grand scheme of things, the professional smart home channel has still had at least some exposure to this type of automation development.

Nice’s voice assistant has been available to CE pros for roughly seven months at this point, while Josh.ai, ever the pioneer when it comes to AI control, has been leveraging contextual AI models in its control system since 2023.

Where Google differs from Nice and Josh, however, is in its core audience, as while Google does interact with the professional space from time to time, the Home platform remains largely popular within the DIY segment of the smart home market.

Gemini’s integration into Google Home will also expand access to the platform across a wide variety of devices such as connected smart speakers, smart displays and Google TV, turning some of the most widely-used electronics in the home into control interfaces for the Google Home platform.

Though this could be viewed as a ‘catching up’ to professional capabilities in Google’s corner, the progress being made here also highlights how powerful AI is at democratizing technology, taking these exceptionally powerful features, once reserved for higher-end systems, and lowering the barrier of entry and cost for the average homeowner.

Though to the extent to which Gemini will be able to match the capabilities of these more sophisticated systems is yet to be seen. For those looking to toy with the new APIs themselves, Google is opening the doors to anyone who wants to sign up to its Developer Newsletter.",https://www.cepro.com/news/gemini-ai-powered-automation-creation-tool-coming-to-google-smart-home-api/618844/,Technology

Auracast[3], a broadcast audio technology based on Bluetooth LE Audio[4], will support effortless audio connection via QR code scanning and sharing, allowing multiple Auracast devices[5] – like Galaxy Buds3 and hearing aids – to join a shared audio stream without the hassle of a complex manual setup. Additionally, customer support at repair centers will be faster and more convenient, thanks to QR and NFC-enabled support[6] accessible right in Samsung Account. You can now register with QR and NFC without having to write any registration form, reducing wait times and simplifying service requests.

Reminder app will be your travel supporter with more convenient and intuitive features. If you are planning a travel to New York with your family, you can manage all your reminders in one place as soon as you open the app with UX that is easy-looking even for first-time users. You can also share the reminder list filled with to-dos during your trip with your family and friends just by pressing a button. When your hands are full of shopping bags, you can use your voice to add reminders on the go as it is voice enabled.

Sharing memories with family and friends will also be easier than ever with enhanced Quick Share[7]. A single tap of the Quick Share button on the Quick Settings panel will let you instantly send and receive files

Logic Pro gets big updates for Mac and iPad – Apple Must,"Music makers rejoice as a major Logic Pro update for Mac and iPad brings new features, tools, and more.

That the iPhone maker is also a major publisher of industry standard creative software is frequently forgotten, but its creative apps help drive the creative industry. That’s why today’s significant Logic Pro update matters so much. It brings an enhanced Stem Splitter and new features like Flashback Capture to improve music production.

New landmark features include:

Stem Splitter, which offers even greater audio fidelity, and can separate guitar and piano into stems.

Flashback Capture lets you retrieve and restore inspiring performances they may have forgotten to record.

New sound packs like Dancefloor Rush.

What’s with Stem Splitter?

The updated Stem Splitter (available for M-series devices) extracts greater detail from old recordings and demos, and now offers added support for guitar and piano stems. Producers can easily select common stem variations, such as acapella, instrumental, or instrumental with vocals using presets and a new submix feature makes it easy for users to export just the parts of audio they want — for example, removing vocals to create an instrumental track, or pulling out the drums and bass for a custom remix.

Flashback Capture

This is interesting. Apple says Flashback Capture allows artists to recover unforgettable performances, even if they forgot to hit record (I don’t know how that’s possible yet, either). Users can quickly restore MIDI and audio performances using a key command or a custom control bar button. By enabling Cycle mode, musicians can improvise multiple takes, and Flashback Capture will automatically organize each pass into a take folder.

New Sound Packs

Dancefloor Rush features expertly crafted drum-and-bass sounds with over 400 dynamic loops, punchy drum kits, and a custom Live Loops grid.

Magnetic Imperfections brings an original texture that captures the raw, unpolished essence of analog tape.

Tosin Abasi showcases progressive metal guitar with boutique amps, unique effects, distinctive picking techniques, and the artist’s signature riffs.

Learn MIDI Comes to iPad

Learn MIDI is now available on iPad, allowing users to get hands-on control by easily assigning their favorite knobs, faders, and buttons on MIDI devices to control plug-ins, instruments, and other automatable parameters within Logic Pro.

New Mac tools

Notepad now features support for Apple’s Writing Tools.

Users can manage large projects with the new search and select feature.

Logic Pro for Mac 11.2 is available May 28 as a free update for existing users and for $199.99 (U.S.) for new users on the Mac App Store. Logic Pro for iPad 2.2 is available May 28 as a free update for existing users, and available on the App Store for $4.99 (U.S.) per month or $49 (U.S.) per year, with a one-month free trial.

Understanding Gaps in OS Data for Melanoma Adjuvant Therapy,"This transcript has been edited for clarity.

Welcome back, everybody. My name is Teresa Amaral, and it's a real pleasure to have you here for this melanoma series on Medscape. We have talked in the last two episodes about the current status of adjuvant therapy and its benefit in patients with stage III melanoma, and in the last episode we discussed the absence of overall survival (OS) benefit.

You may question why it is important to have this discussion in terms of the absence of OS benefit or the absence of data on the OS benefit. This absence of data might have three consequences, and I'm going to go through them with you.

The first one is associated with reimbursement. The fact that we will need to wait until 2028, most likely, to evaluate the OS benefit from adjuvant therapy compared to placebo in stage III might lead to some discussions in terms of the reimbursement and might lead some agencies to consider whether they would like to continue reimbursing this therapy or not in this setting.

Second, in some countries, the absence of OS data is leading to discussions on whether they will fund this therapy or not until there is clear proof that there is an OS benefit.

The third point is related to the fact that we don't knowthe patient's individual benefit. We also know that, depending on the stage, we might need to treat more patients to actually have one patient to prevent a recurrence.

For example, we know that in patients in stage IIB, we will have to treat between five and nine patients in stage IIB to prevent a recurrence. In patients with stage IIC, we need to treat between four and seven patients to prevent a recurrence.

All of these cost-effectiveness analyses are being done by the healthcare agencies, and this obviously needs to be taken into consideration when we are discussing these types of therapiesthat have a benefit in terms of relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival but lack data in terms of OS benefit.

Another point is that, despite the fact that all the guidelines have been supporting the use of this therapy in stage III and stage IV — namely the ESMO guidelines and the ASCO guidelines— there is some uncertainty in terms of the OS benefit. This may lead to some difficult discussions and a lack of clear direction in terms of whatpatients should do when they need to make a decision on receiving adjuvant therapy or not.

The patients and their treating physicians may struggle with treatment choices due to this uncertainty and the fact that they don't know if there will be a long-term survival impact for this particular patient or not.

Here, we come to the first discussion that we had a couple of sessions before, which is the absence of prognostic and predictive biomarkers in this setting. Besides that, we really don't know the impact of these adjuvant treatments in terms of long-term benefitwhen we talk about OS, which might lead to reduced use of these therapies in stage III and stage II. This decline in terms of use of these adjuvant therapies has already been seen in some countries, like in Denmark.",https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/navigating-adjuvant-therapy-decisions-melanoma-amid-gaps-2025a1000cbq,Technology
Solitonic superfluorescence paves way for high-temperature quantum materials,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

A study in Nature describes both the mechanism and the material conditions necessary for superfluorescence at room temperature. The work could serve as a blueprint for designing materials that allow exotic quantum states—such as superconductivity, superfluidity or superfluorescence—at high temperatures, paving the way for applications such as quantum computers that don't require extremely low temperatures to operate.

The international team that did the work was led by North Carolina State University and included researchers from Duke University, Boston University and the Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

""In this work, we show both experimental and theoretical reasons behind macroscopic quantum coherence at high temperature,"" says Kenan Gundogdu, professor of physics at NC State and corresponding author of the study.

""In other words, we can finally explain how and why some materials will work better than others in applications that require exotic quantum states at ambient temperatures.""

Picture a school of fish swimming in unison or the synchronized flashing of fireflies—examples of collective behavior in nature. When similar collective behavior happens in the quantum world—a phenomenon known as macroscopic quantum phase transition—it leads to exotic processes such as superconductivity, superfluidity, or superfluorescence.

In all these processes, a group of quantum particles forms a macroscopically coherent system that acts like a giant quantum particle.

However, quantum phase transitions normally require super-cold, or cryogenic, conditions to occur. This is because higher temperatures create thermal ""noise"" that disrupts the synchronization and prevents the phase transition.

In a previous study, Gundogdu and colleagues determined that the atomic structure of some hybrid perovskites protected the groups of quantum particles from the thermal noise long enough for the phase transition to occur.

In these materials, large polarons—groups of atoms bound to electrons—formed, insulating light-emitting dipoles from thermal interference and allowing superfluorescence.

In the new study, the researchers found out how the insulating effect works. When they used a laser to excite the electrons within the hybrid perovskite they studied, they saw large groups of polarons coming together. This grouping is called a soliton.

""Picture the atomic lattice as a fine cloth stretched between two points,"" Gundogdu says. ""If you place solid balls—which represent excitons—on the cloth, each ball deforms the cloth locally. To get an exotic state like superfluorescence, you need all the excitons, or balls, to form a coherent group and interact with the lattice as a unit, but at high temperatures thermal noise prevents this.

""The ball and its local deformation together form a polaron,"" Gundogdu continues.

""When these polarons transition from a random distribution to an ordered formation in the lattice, they make a soliton, or coherent unit. The soliton formation process dampens the thermal disturbances, which otherwise impede quantum effects.""

""A soliton only forms when there is enough density of polarons excited in the material,"" says Mustafa Türe, NC State Ph.D. student and co-first author of the paper.

""Our theory shows that if the density of polarons is low, the system has only free incoherent polarons, whereas beyond a threshold density, polarons evolve into solitons.""

""In our experiments we directly measured the evolution of a group of polarons from an incoherent uncorrelated phase to an ordered phase,"" adds Melike Biliroglu, postdoctoral researcher at NC State and co-first author of the work.

""This is one of the first direct observations of macroscopic quantum state formation.""

To confirm that the soliton formation suppresses the detrimental effects of temperature, the group worked with Volker Blum, the Rooney Family Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke, to calculate the lattice oscillations responsible for thermal interference.

They also collaborated with Vasily Temnov, professor of physics at CNRS and Ecole Polytechnique, to simulate the recombination dynamics of the soliton in the presence of thermal noise. Their work confirmed the experimental results and verified the intrinsic coherence of the soliton.

The work represents a leap forward in understanding both how and why certain hybrid perovskites are able to exhibit exotic quantum states.

""Prior to this work it wasn't clear if there was a mechanism behind high temperature quantum effects in these materials,"" says Franky So, co-author of the paper and the Walter and Ida Freeman Distinguished Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at NC State.

""This work shows a quantitative theory and backs it up with experimental results,"" Gundogdu says.

""Macroscopic quantum effects such as superconductivity are key to all the quantum technologies we are pursuing—quantum communication, cryptology, sensing and computation—and all of them are currently limited by the need for low temperatures. But now that we understand the theory, we have guidelines for designing new quantum materials that can function at high temperatures, which is a huge step forward.""

Switch 2 will add a rewind function to its online N64 games,"On June 5, which is also the Switch 2's launch day, Nintendo is rolling out new features for N64 games on Switch Online. If you just want to play to relax and not worry about in-game lives, the ability to rewind will perhaps sound like the most useful among the upcoming features. It will let you, well, rewind the game if you make a mistake so you can try again from that point. Failed to a get a birdie on Mario Golf? No problem. Just access the feature and choose from the panels at the bottom that show up to choose which point you'd like to start from again. That said, the function will only be accessible on the Switch 2.

Another new feature coming to N64 games is the CRT filter. Yes, it will give your game that old CRT TV look by putting a pixelated texture on top of it. If you've originally played N64 titles on old TVs, it could be a fantastic throwback to your youth. Like the rewind function, though, the option will be exclusively available on the Switch 2. It's not quite clear why it won't be rolling out on Switch consoles, as well. If you're not getting the new console, the only update you're getting on June 5 is the ability to check what each controller button does on the game you're playing. You can then change what each button does to make the controls easier for you.",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2-will-add-a-rewind-function-to-its-online-n64-games-121506171.html,Technology
Schaltbau highlights megawatt charging technology at The Battery Show Europe 2025,"Schaltbau, a specialist in direct current (DC) technology, will showcase its new Eddicy megawatt contactor portfolio for electric commercial vehicles and charging solutions at The Battery Show Europe which will take place in Stuttgart from June 3-5 2025.

Schaltbau’s Eddicy portfolio is designed for both stationery and mobile charging infrastructure, including DC technology for commercial and off-road electric vehicles (EVs).

At the heart of Eddicy’s offering are the megawatt contactors, now expanded to meet the rising demand for MCS Level 2 and Level 3 charging systems. The latest innovations feature compact designs tailored to both high-power stationary and mobile applications, ensuring fast, efficient, and safe charging for electric commercial trucks, e-buses, and more.

“Megawatt charging is beginning to move from lab to highway. And we are ready: Our megawatt charging contactors can handle up to 3,000A, which is the kind of power needed to recharge a commercial truck in 15 minutes during a regular driver’s break,” says Helmut Pusch, CEO Schaltbau GmbH Group. “Our solutions minimize contact resistance, maintain system safety, offer a competitive total cost of ownership and thus enable true long-haul trucking or heavier e-trucks for mining and off-road logistics.”

The new contactors for both stationary (C305 and C330) and mobile (C805 and C830) applications feature a compact, open-isolation design that offers robust protection under extreme conditions. Even during high short-circuit events, the contactors prevent system damage and component failure. The C330, for example, can withstand a short-time current of 15,000A for five milliseconds without contact welding – a critical safety benchmark for high-power systems. The contactors have silver alloy contact pills for contact resistance as low as 35 µOhm.

In addition to the new megawatt charging products, Eddicy presents its compact C303 and C803 contactors engineered to meet the strict space requirements of charging stations and e-mobility platforms.

With low contact resistance, these contactors minimize power losses and heat generation, while their robust design extends operational lifespan, reducing the need for frequent replacements and minimizing downtime. These features make the C303 and C803 ideal solutions for demanding e-mobility and fast charging applications, offering significant long-term cost savings up to 25%.

"Reviewing Findings on Nutrition’s Connection to Lung Health, with Lisa G. Wood, PhD","A presentation titled ‘Pediatric Year in Review’ was given at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2025 International Conference in San Francisco, during which presenter Lisa G. Wood, PhD, highlighted recent findings on nutrition and its connection with respiratory health outcomes.

Wood, who is known for her research at the Hunter Medical Research Institute (HMRI) and work as a professor at the University of Newcastle, spoke with the HCPLive editorial team about her presentation from ATS and its major takeaways. First, Wood was asked what had led to her presenting on the topic of diet and its relationship with lung health.

“My research team is based at the University of Newcastle in Australia, and we have been working on examining the relationship between nutrition and respiratory disease for the last 20-odd years,” Wood explained. “We've been looking across the lifespan. The effects of nutrition in childhood are what has been one of our areas of focus. We've been really interested in it as a topic because, typically, there hasn't been a lot of research trying to link nutrition and respiratory outcomes.”

Wood was asked by HCPLive about what she felt were some of the most compelling findings this year that she had presented regarding the impact of early-life nutrition on the onset of respiratory diseases in children.

“Among the topics that I covered in my ‘Year in Review’ presentation were, first of all, a paper that was looking at ultra-processed foods,” Wood said. “They are foods that are industrially produced and are very far away from whole foods…They are manufactured, so they have different nutrient composition, and they are increasingly consumed. Now over 50% of the dietary energy intake in high-income countries comes from these ultra-processed foods. So the fact that they're eaten in such large quantities really makes us ask the question, how are they affecting our health?”

Wood explained that this research and, generally speaking, an increasing amount of work being published, demonstrate that such processed foods could be detrimental to health. She pointed to a paper published in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology.

“This paper was a systematic review of the literature, and it looked at the association between ultra-processed foods allergies and asthma,” Wood said. “They did actually find quite a number of studies that demonstrated a link between ultra-processed foods and the development of allergies and asthma in children. They also found that ultra-processed foods altered the gut microbiome and caused immune dysregulation. So I think this is a really important finding.”

Wood did note, however, that a number of papers did not demonstrate any effect on asthma or lung health related to ultra-processed foods. Nevertheless, the volume of research pointing to a connection was described by Wood as significant.

“It really directs researchers to go and look further to understand why this is occurring,” Wood explained. “That will allow us to develop some therapeutic strategies, or intervention strategies to avoid the negative effects of ultra-processed foods.”

Amazon Prime Day 2025: Everything you need to know about the annual July sales event,"Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .

This year’s Amazon Prime Day is coming soon, so it’s a good time to start thinking about the things you’ll want to look for once the deal wave hits. Everything from gadgets to clothes to household necessities will be on sale during the event as part of the Prime Day deals, and if you’re a Prime member, you’ll have access to all of the discounts. Engadget will be surfacing all of the best tech deals we can find, but there are some important things to know ahead of time so you can get exactly what you want out of this year’s Prime Day.

When is Prime Day 2025?

Amazon Prime Day 2025 will be back this year sometime in July, but the official dates have not been released yet.

What is Prime Day?

Prime Day is Amazon's members-only shopping event, which means you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber on Prime Day to take advantage of most of the savings. Amazon still offers a 30-day free trial to new Prime subscribers, so you can start your free trial closer to July and participate in the event.

How often is Prime Day?

Amazon Prime Day typically comes around annually in July. In the last few years, Amazon has also had its ""Big Deal Days"" in October, which is effectively a second Prime Day and the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season.

How does Prime Day work?

Prime subscribers can go to Amazon's site on Prime Day to see all of the exclusive deals they have access to. Prime subscribers do not have to do anything additional to get Prime Day sales: the discounts you see on product pages will show up in your cart automatically. If you're not a Prime subscriber and you go to Amazon to shop on Prime Day, you'll likely see tons of items on sale but only ""with Prime;"" those discounts will not be available to those who are not active Prime subscribers.

ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement

If you don’t pay for Prime and have no intention of doing so, you should still check out Amazon on Prime Day for sales that are available to all shoppers — there are always a few of them. Plus, it’s very likely that other retailers like Target and Best Buy will have their own competing Prime Day sales during that time frame, too.

How to prep for Prime Day

First, make a list. It’s best to go into Amazon Prime Day as prepared as possible; that means knowing exactly what you want so you stay focused and avoid distractions. Make note of the most important items you want to pick up on Prime Day ahead of time. You can either do this the old-fashioned way on a sticky note, or you can use Amazon’s wish list feature. For the latter, add the items you want to buy on Prime Day to your wish list (or, even better, make a dedicated wishlist with only your Prime Day desirables) and return to that list during the shopping event. Not only will you have everything you want all in one place, but you’ll also be able to see which of those items are cheaper on Prime Day than they were when you originally added them to your list.

Second, use a price tracker. Sites like CamelCamelCamel and Keepa let you monitor the price of specific items on Amazon. You can check out price history charts and you can make your own price-drop alerts, receiving emails when something you want gets a discount. Both CamelCamelCamel and Keepa also have some browser extensions you can download so you don’t have to navigate away from an Amazon product page to check its price history.

Amazon Prime Day deals

Amazon Prime Day typically lasts a couple of days, but for the past few years, the company has started pushing out deals well before the event actually kicks off. We anticipate the same happening this year, with early Prime Day deals kicking off possibly as soon as Amazon officially announces the dates of Prime Day 2025.

ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement

While we wouldn't call the following sales ""early Prime Day deals"" just yet, they do represent some of the best deals you can get on Amazon right now as we wait for the full details of Prime Day to be revealed. We'll update this list as prices change and as we find even more of the best Amazon deals you can get.

The Switch 2 May Signal the End of Physical Games,"One of the biggest changes of Nintendo's generational leap to the Switch 2 is the new console's game carts. Not the aesthetic shift—they're now red, to differentiate them from the original Switch's slate gray ones—but rather that, in many cases, they won't contain a game at all.

While all first-party Nintendo games are currently expected to be released on-cart, other publishers may choose to release their Switch 2 titles on “game-key cards.” These have no actual game data on them, instead serving as a physical license to access and play a digital version of a game. Per Nintendo, after players insert the game-key card into their console, they'll be prompted to download the associated game. An internet connection will be required to download the game and for any online features, but otherwise, game-key card titles will be playable offline as normal, so long as that physical cartridge is inserted, its presence serving as a software authentication tool.

It's a direction that has proven controversial with both fans and some developers (former Assassin's Creed and Far Cry lead Alex Hutchinson said, “I think it’s sort of lame,” while Nightdive Studios CEO Stephen Kick said the move is “a little disheartening”) and could be confusing for consumers, despite Nintendo's plans to clearly mark the packaging of game-key card titles. However, the move does have several positives—and it may just be a harbinger of the future for the entire games industry.

Better Than Literally Nothing

Probably the biggest plus point to game-key cards is that they're an improvement on the current equivalent, which is … nothing at all. Switch cartridges are a proprietary storage format, which means they can be more expensive, per GB of storage, to release games on than mass-market media. As a result, several game publishers sell titles in a “code in a box” format—entirely empty Switch cases with a single-use, digital download code to redeem on the Nintendo eShop.

While these sorts of releases ostensibly fill a market gap, giving real-world retailers a product to put on shelves and, even for online sellers, providing some form of physical object to send to customers—useful to give out as gifts, for instance—they've always been an odd category. Collectors typically want an actual game on their shelves, while those unbothered by a permanent library would likely be browsing a digital-only storefront in the first place. Either way, once that code has been redeemed, the customer is left with an empty plastic case with no purpose and no secondary market value. Code-in-a-box releases are ultimately a waste of materials to produce and dispose of, the remnants likely destined for landfill.

Game-key cards go some small way to solving these problems. For collectors, they'll have something in the case lining their shelves, making their collections tangible, while more casual players can take a chance on titles they're unsure of. That's because the carts won't be tied to user accounts—anyone with the cart downloads their own copy of the game. Because the cartridge itself is the key, you'll be able to lend out, sell, or trade-in game-key cards as easily as carts for previous console generations, and only whoever physically possesses it will be able to play.

There is still a convenience factor to consider, as you'll need to have that cart inserted into your Switch 2 to play the game, unlike entirely digital purchases, but it stands to be a far more versatile and arguably consumer-friendly approach than those one-time codes. We'll have chance to see which format players prefer with the first wave of Switch 2 titles, as titles like EA's Split Fiction sticks with the code-in-a-box approach.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-switch-2-may-signal-the-end-of-physical-games/,Technology
Recombinant Flu Shots Can Prevent Additional Hospital Stays,"TOPLINE:

A recent analysis indicated that switching from the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine to the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) could have prevented nearly 100,000 hospitalizations among working-age adults in the United States over 10 seasons. The greatest benefits would have been seen in individuals aged 50-64 years and at-risk adults aged 18-49 years with chronic conditions.

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers investigated the burden of influenza and the potential impact of switching from the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine to RIV in reducing influenza-related hospitalizations among working-age adults in the United States, including those aged 18-49 years or 50-64 years.

They collected data on influenza burden, vaccine effectiveness, and coverage rates for both age groups from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the years 2012-2023, excluding 2020-2021.

The rates of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths were estimated among adults aged 18-49 years or 50-64 years with at least one chronic medical condition.

A modeling analysis was carried out for both age groups to estimate the potential reduction in hospitalizations if RIV had replaced the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine, taking chronic conditions into account.

TAKEAWAY:

Over the past decade, influenza caused a median annual number of 151,021 hospitalizations and 7215 deaths among US adults of working age, with adults aged 50-64 years experiencing threefold and fivefold higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths, respectively, than those aged 18-49 years.

Among adults aged 18-49 years, the 14% with chronic conditions accounted for 28% of hospitalizations and 29% of deaths related to influenza. Similarly, among those aged 50-64 years, the 47% with at least one chronic condition accounted for 68% of hospitalizations and 69% of deaths related to influenza.

The modelling analysis indicated that a complete switch to RIV could have prevented a total of 87,654 (95% CI, 74,518-101,482) additional influenza-related hospitalizations over the past ten seasons among adults aged 50-64 years.

Similarly, among adults aged 18-49 years, a switch to RIV could have prevented a total of 14,436 (95% CI, 10,100-19,963) additional influenza-related hospitalizations over the same period.

IN PRACTICE:

“Considering the whole 50- to 64-year age group for the use of enhanced vaccines, like RIV, deserves consideration as it could support public health interventions promoting healthy aging,” the authors wrote. “A risk-based recommendation may be more appropriate for younger working ages, given the fraction of burden within those with chronic conditions,” they added.

SOURCE:

The study was led by Laurence Torcel-Pagnon, MSc, Sanofi, Lyon, France. It was published online on April 17, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

LIMITATIONS:

The vaccine effectiveness of RIV vs the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccinevaries between seasons and studies, making it challenging to compare benefits across different scenarios. The analysis was limited due to a scarcity of high-quality evidence on clinical burden and vaccine effectiveness in at-risk groups. Lastly, the modeling approach used may not have considered indirect effects that influenced vaccination at the population level.

DISCLOSURES:

This study was funded by Sanofi. The authors reported being employees of Sanofi and potentially holding shares in the company.

"What to Expect at WWDC 2025: Major iOS 19 Revamp, Apple Intelligence Under Pressure","In less than two weeks, I'll be on a plane to California along with PCMag's software expert, Michael Muchmore, for Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where we expect to see a design overhaul for iOS 19 and maybe a surprise or two.

The event runs from June 9-13 and begins with a keynote at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET on Monday, June 9, at Apple Park in Cupertino. It will be live-streamed on the Apple Developer app, the Apple developer website , and the Apple Developer YouTube channel .

As a developer-focused event, WWDC is all about software. Apple provided a first look at Apple Intelligence during WWDC 2024, but the company is still working on fulfilling its AI promises. It released a few features, like a ChatGPT integration, notification summaries, and Writing Tools, but is still struggling to deliver a big Siri revamp (prompting several false advertising lawsuits ). Will Apple acknowledge these shortcomings at WWDC or breeze right along with details about upcoming AI features?

Meet Me in the Solarium

WWDC typically includes the introduction of Apple's next-gen operating systems, so developers have a few months to play around with them before a formal launch in the fall. This year, that's iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16.

Apple is reportedly planning a major user interface (UI) overhaul for its OSes called Solarium, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. It will bring design elements from the Vision Pro to other Apple devices, which could mean more translucent backgrounds and circular app icons.

YouTuber Jon Prosser last month also hinted at rounded corners on options within dialog boxes, app menus, and search bars, plus a floating translucent navigation menu and the repositioning of the search bar to the bottom of the screen.

VisionOS (Credit: Apple)

This could help usher in Apple's reported shift to ""visual AI."" In March, CEO Tim Cook reassigned the Siri revamp to Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell, and we've heard rumors about Apple's ambitions to put cameras in AirPods and Apple Watches. Apple has reportedly abandoned plans for the latter, but AirPods are still on the table and might receive a live translation feature with iOS 19. Concrete features and new hardware experiences would be welcome after the letdown of Apple Intelligence.

But while the Vision Pro might set the tone for Apple's next evolution, the Vision Pro itself remains too expensive for the average user at $3,500. Apple is reportedly working on a more user-friendly pair of glasses to compete with Meta's Ray-Ban specs and Google's Android XR glasses, but that's not expected to debut anytime soon. As arguably the most ""fashionable"" of the tech companies, we expect Apple to ultimately nail the style side of this. The question is how much advanced Vision Pro tech can it fit into pared-down smart glasses?

Until then, we expect Apple to announce visionOS 3 at WWDC. Earlier this year, Gurman said the next visionOS is ""pretty feature-packed,"" but details are scant.

Other iOS 19 rumors, meanwhile, include an AI-based battery-management feature. It might also talk up plans for an ""AI doctor"" and Health app revamp or new AI partners, like Google's Gemini. We won't see new iPhones until the fall (hopefully without a significant tariff-related price hike), but the iPhone 17 lineup will likely support whatever Apple introduces at WWDC.

Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing the 175-acre Apple Park for the first time, the ideal mothership for a few days of Apple geekdom.",https://www.pcmag.com/news/wwdc-2025-what-to-expect-how-to-watch-major-ios-19-revamp-apple-intelligence,Technology
NICU Admissions Higher in Pregestational Diabetes,"TOPLINE:

Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission rates were significantly higher among infants born to mothers with pregestational diabetes than among those born to mothers with gestational diabetes (GD).

METHODOLOGY:

This Irish study compared risks for NICU admission across maternal diabetes subtypes (type 1 diabetes [T1D], type 2 diabetes [T2D], and GD) to refine counselling and neonatal care.

Researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of 25,238 births (January 2018 to December 2020) and identified 3905 neonates born ≥ 34 weeks to mothers with diabetes, including those with T1D (n = 67), T2D (n = 60), and GD (n = 3712).

Data on gestational age, birth weight, mode of delivery, and maternal age were extracted from the registry. NICU admission details (indications, hypoglycaemia, and respiratory support) and maternal characteristics (body mass index [BMI] > 30 and preeclampsia) were obtained via electronic records.

The analysis was performed using quasi-Poisson regression for assessing NICU admission risk ratios (RRs), analysis of variance for comparing gestational age/birth weight, and chi-square tests for comparing categorical variables.

The primary outcome was the NICU admission rate; secondary outcomes included respiratory distress, severe hypoglycaemia, and maternal discharge timing.

TAKEAWAY:

Neonates born to mothers with T1D and T2D had a admission rate of 41.8% (RR, 3.32) and 31.1% (RR, 3.89), respectively, with both significantly higher than that in those born to mothers with GD (12.5%; RR, 0.133; P ≤ .001); the hospital baseline admission rate was 11.5%.

Neonates of mothers with T1D were born earlier (mean, 37 + 1 weeks) than those of mothers with T2D (mean, 38 + 1 weeks; P = .0019) and GD (mean, 39 weeks; P ≤ .001).

Moreover, they showed significantly higher birth weight centiles than those of mothers with T2D and GD at 25th (T1D vs T2D, P = .0042; T1D vs GD, P ≤ .001), median (P ≤ .0001 for both), and 75th centiles (T1D vs T2D, P ≤ .0001; T1D vs GD, P = .0009).

Respiratory distress dominated T1D admissions (36.7%), while hypoglycaemia was primary in T2D (73.7%).

Mothers with pregestational diabetes were more frequently discharged before their infants (T1D, 42.9%; T2D, 31.5%) than those with GD (21.2%).

IN PRACTICE:

""It is important to counsel mothers on risks and expectations for the newborn period,"" the authors of the study wrote. ""The aim of our study is to describe how the type of maternal diabetes impacts admission to NICU and to provide up-to-date, local data to support healthcare professionals when counselling patients with diabetes in pregnancy,"" they added.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Dearbhla Hillick, Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. It was published online on May 22, 2025, in the European Journal of Pediatrics.

LIMITATIONS:

This study was limited by the dataset being unbalanced, with most neonates born to mothers with GD. Neonates of mothers without diabetes requiring NICU admission were not included. Factors such as maternal smoking, raised BMI, or preeclampsia possibly confounded the NICU admission risk.

DISCLOSURES:

Open access funding was provided by the IReL Consortium. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

HIV Medication Adherence Critical for Viral Suppression,"TOPLINE:

A recent study found that antiretroviral therapy adherence below 90% was associated with significantly lower odds of viral suppression among women living with HIV.

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers analyzed data from community-based prospective cohort study including women living with HIV across British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec between 2013 and 2018.

Overall, 1187 participants (median age, 42 years) who reported antiretroviral therapy use and specified their regimen were included in the analysis.

Participants completed questionnaire surveys at three timepoints, at 18 months interval between 2013 and 2018.

Analysis focused on the relationship between adherence to antiretroviral therapy and viral suppression using data from the study period between 2017 and 2018.

TAKEAWAY:

The use of integrase strand transfer inhibitors increased from 13.6% in 2013 to 30.6% in 2018, whereas the utilization of other antiretroviral classes showed declining trends.

Among participants, 78.2% reported undetectable viral loads, and viral suppression was achieved by 89.6% of those on regimens consisting of a backbone plus a third agent.

Less than 70% adherence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.27) and 80%-89% adherence (aOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.86) were associated with lower odds of viral suppression compared with ≥ 95% adherence.

Researchers found no significant difference in the odds of viral suppression between 90%-94% adherence and ≥ 95% adherence.

IN PRACTICE:

“With the chronic nature of HIV and the risk of resistance, supporting patients in overcoming the challenges that accompany long-term medication adherence through cotailored approaches should remain a priority when providing care to women living with HIV,” the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

The study was led by Alexandra de Pokomandy, Department of Family Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was published online on May 2, 2025, in HIV Medicine.

LIMITATIONS:

The study was limited by a small sample size in groups with lower adherence, which may have reduced the statistical power to detect significant differences. All measures were self-reported, introducing social desirability bias and recall bias. The study also lacked information on the status of mental health treatment and the duration of viral suppression.

DISCLOSURES:

The study received funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian HIV Trials Network, the Ontario HIV Treatment Network, and the Ontario Academic Health Science Centers Alternative Funding Plans Innovation. Two authors reported having financial ties with several pharmaceutical companies.

This Android smartwatch released last year still beats the competition - and it's on sale,"Matthew Miller/ZDNET

You can find the OnePlus Watch 2 on sale for $245 at Amazon and $250 at OnePlus right now, down from the usual price of $300.

When OnePlus announced the OnePlus Watch in 2021, I immediately placed an order because the hardware looked compelling and priced at $159. After a few weeks, I returned the device due to its sheer lack of offering anything of value.

The original OnePlus Watch was powered by the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), which was perfectly fine, as many smartwatches run lean and mean. However, last year's OnePlus Watch 2 takes things to the next level by offering RTOS and Wear OS 4 on a single watch with a dual-engine architecture. With this unique approach, the device is one of the most efficient Wear OS watches available today, with longer battery life than any other Google Wear OS device or Apple Watch.

Also: I highly recommend shopping these health tracker Memorial Day deals

In addition to a powerful operating system strategy, OnePlus has created one of the most elegant smartwatches available. The device incorporates stainless steel in the watch body, a 2.5D smooth sapphire crystal watch face, and a durable silicone watch band. The right-side buttons are stylishly incorporated into the bezel, with a round button on top and an oval one on the bottom.

The OnePlus Watch 2 is built to meet 5 ATM water resistance and has an IP68 rating, so you can wear it without worrying about swimming and other outdoor adventures. In addition, the device has been built to satisfy MIL-STD-810H standards, so it beats out even the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

Matthew Miller/ZDNET

OnePlus states the watch will last for 100 hours in Smart Mode, 48 hours with heavy use, and up to 12 days in power-saver mode. It has a 500mAh battery. In my two weeks of testing, I could wear the watch 24/7 and charge it up every three to four days. I wore the device for running and walking with GPS tracking turned on, indoor rowing for active heart-rate tracking, and more.

The battery will be consumed faster with the always-on display mode enabled. But as I found the lift-to-wake feature performed well, I kept the always-on display turned off when I first tested it.

Even though the OnePlus Watch 2 has excellent battery life, it also supports 7.5W VOOC fast charging, so you can charge the device up to 100% in just an hour and get a day of use in a much shorter period. A long battery life with processor efficiency and fast charging are the best combos for a smartwatch.

Also: My favorite Garmin safety feature is coming to Forerunner models - and I can't recommend it enough

Dual frequency, L5 and L1, satellite position is present, with support for Beidou, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and QZSS GNSS. The watch tracked me in almost the same way as my dedicated GPS sports watches. And with support for Wear OS, you can use your dedicated watch applications if you don't want to use OHealth. Heart-rate tracking on the watch was also accurate.

Matthew Miller/ZDNET

OnePlus requires the use of the OHealth app on your Android phone, and the watch does not work with an Apple iPhone. The Wear OS app is not used, as the watch apps, settings, and health and wellness features are managed through said app.

The OHealth app offers a clean user interface, and I prefer using it over the Google and Fitbit apps found on Pixel Watches. At this time, the data collected by the OnePlus Watch 2 remains in OHealth, with OnePlus publicly stating it has future plans to support syncing to other services, such as Strava.

Screenshot by Matthew Miller/ZDNET

The OHealth app and OnePlus Watch 2 support tracking your heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, sleep, workouts, and more. The OHealth app is also used to manage your selected watch faces and the Wear OS tiles that appear when you swipe left and right on the watch face. The OHealth app contains many settings, and I find the software easier to navigate than the Wear OS app on a Pixel phone.

Also: Your Oura ring just got a major upgrade that fixes its biggest flaw - for free

Also, make sure to check out the extensive number of workout and health settings, which include heart-rate alerts, breathing assessments while you sleep, auto-workout detection, and even customization of the displays for your favorite workouts.

Matthew Miller/ZDNET

While the OnePlus Watch 2 is a significantly better watch than the first-generation device, there is room for improvement. There is no option for cellular connectivity, the single 47mm diameter with 80 grams of weight isn't the best for people with smaller wrists, there is no support for fall detection, there is no capability to control a OnePlus phone camera from the watch (this is coming in a future update), women's health-tracking features are not present, the watch cannot capture ECG readings, and there is no skin-temperature sensor.

However, I loved wearing this elegant watch and swiping across the face to access my favorite tiles. The Google Pixel Watch is too small for me, and the battery life is too short to enjoy its functionality. The OnePlus Watch 2 shows there is hope for better options at a reasonable price.

ZDNET's buying advice

After testing the first OnePlus Watch, I had little confidence that OnePlus would impress me with another RTOS smartwatch. I was frankly blown away by the work that the company has done to make the OnePlus Watch 2 one of the best watches available for Android smartphone users, while still having room for improvement.

At around $250 right now, the device is a must-buy for OnePlus phone owners and a watch that all Android smartphone users should consider. You can also look forward to future software updates that will make this watch an even better investment.

When will this deal expire? As per OnePlus, this deal will end on May 31, 2025.

"Seagate’s 8TB Game Drive for Xbox Just Got Cheaper for a Limited Time, 16x Storage and One Solid Deal","For friends, family, and loved ones who play video games on the reg, some new gaming accessories make for wonderful gifts. with Memorial Day deals still abound, you can find some big opportunities to save on peripherals and components such as controllers, headsets, hard drives, you name it. If you yourself are an Xbox Series X or Series S player or love someone who is, treat yourself or them to this Seagate Game Drive for Xbox. You can expand the onboard storage to download and play more games for just $190. Normally this external hard drive goes for $220, but right now it’s $30 off over at Best Buy.

See at Best Buy

The Xbox Series X and Series S are the current generation of Microsoft gaming consoles. The more robust Series X features an internal SSD with a total storage of 1TB while the Series S supports a storage of just 512GB out of the box. After considering the system software loaded on them that gets consoles to run in the first place, the actually-usable storage is considerably less than that. Plus, games these days are ballooning in file size. Most recently, the The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster released last month and that game alone has a download size of over a hundred gigabytes. If you want to make the best of your Xbox console, you’re going to want some form of additional storage.

8TB of Xbox Storage

The Seagate Game Drive for Xbox will add a whopping 8TB to your console. That’s almost 16 times the storage capacity as the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S off the shelf.

Adding an external hard drive to your Xbox could not be easier. The Seagate expansion hard drive simply plugs into your console over USB. The Xbox Series S or Xbox Series X will recognize it to be a hard drive and will allow you to choose to download games directly to it instead of the console’s internal drive. The external hard drives only takes about two minutes to set up.

Some past generation titles or smaller indie games can be played directly off the external hard drive. However, newer, more expansive titles will require you to move them from the hard drive to the Xbox’s internal drive as they require the fast load times the onboard storage offers.

Consider Sex of Both Parent and Child in MetS Screening,"TOPLINE:

Parental metabolic syndrome (MetS) had a notable impact on the metabolic health of offspring; paternal MetS showed stronger associations with several metabolic markers in boys, whereas maternal MetS was linked to elevated triglyceride levels in both sexes but affected other markers, primarily in boys.

METHODOLOGY:

Multiple studies have examined the influence of parental MetS on children; however, the differential effects of maternal and paternal MetS on female vs male offspring remain unclear.

Researchers conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study using a Korean database from 2007 to 2020 to investigate the influence of parental MetS on various metabolic aspects in offspring, using a sex-specific approach.

They included 5245 adolescents aged 10-18 years, including 2785 boys and 2460 girls; anthropometric and clinical data were required to be available for the adolescents and their parents.

MetS in adolescents was defined according to the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.

The investigators used multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate the effects of parental MetS status on the presence of MetS and cardiometabolic risk factors in adolescent offspring.

TAKEAWAY:

Boys with paternal MetS had higher levels of serum glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) than those without paternal MetS (P < .01 for all); clinically meaningful effect sizes were observed only for triglycerides (Cohen’s d = 0.231) and HDL-C (Cohen’s d = −0.208).

Adolescents with maternal MetS showed higher levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-C and lower levels of HDL-C than those without maternal MetS, in both sexes. In boys, the differences were significant and clinically meaningful for systolic blood pressure (Cohen’s d = 0.213), triglycerides (Cohen’s d = 0.332), and HDL-C (Cohen’s d = −0.284).

Girls with maternal MetS showed a clinically significant increase only in triglyceride levels (Cohen’s d = 0.286).

The odds of MetS and many of its components were substantially elevated in boys in the presence of paternal or maternal MetS; girls showed limited effects, with maternal MetS linked only to elevated triglycerides and paternal MetS to elevated blood pressure.

IN PRACTICE:

“These results suggest that the inheritance mechanism of MetS is highly complex and that both parental and offspring sex should be considered in future screening and prevention of MetS,” the authors concluded.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Jun-Hong Park, Ajou University School of Medicine in Suwon-si, Republic of Korea. It was published online on May 21, 2025, in Scientific Reports.

LIMITATIONS:

This study had a cross-sectional design and lacked detailed data on hormonal profiles and dietary factors. The dataset lacked information on prenatal exposures known to affect the cardiometabolic health of offspring, such as gestational age, weight gain, diabetes status, and birth weight.

DISCLOSURES:

This study received no specific funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

New Mavic 4 Pro Is A World Beater For Warriors As Well As Movie Makers,"The Mavic Pro 4 is DJI's new flagship drone with impressive aerial photography capabilities DJI

This month, Chinese drone makers DJI launched their long awaited Mavic 4 Pro quadcopter. As expected, the latest version of the company’s flagship product is packed with upgrades and new features. If you want swooping aerial shots capturing crisp 6K video, this is your drone.

But there is also a huge community of military Mavic users on both sides of the war in Ukraine waiting to get their hands on the new technology too.

Based on the specifications and reviews so far, the Mavic 4 Pro will set a new standard in drone cinematography. It will also make an extremely effective war machine.

Reluctant Participants In The Drone War

DJI, based in Shenzhen, China, insist that their drones are for peaceful use only and have reapteadly condemned their use in warfare. They have banned sales in both Ukraine and Russia.

But DJI commands around 70% of the global consumer drone market for good reason. Their products are world beaters which open affordable drone photography to even the least skilled consumer. Their drones, in particular the Mavic series which fold up small enough to fit in cargo pocket, give every squad their own aerial reconnaissance capability. They have been extremely popular with both sides and regularly top the lists of equipment requested by soldiers.

Russian military blogger Alexey Rogozin stated that the ""Mavic (quadcopter) has already become the de facto standard in reconnaissance for the parties to the conflict in Ukraine.""

In fact, the name ‘Mavic’ has become a generic term for battlefield quadcopters, much to DJI’s dismay.

Both armies have a small industry devoted to ‘hacking’ the drones, modifying the firmware to get around limitations imposed by the makers and prevent them from being tracked.

The small drones have transformed artillery fire, by finding hidden targets and enabling commanders to adjust their aim, doing far more damage with fewer rounds.

They are also lethal bombers. Mavics with simple drop hardware rain down grenades on enemy positions with deadly precision, dropping munitions into foxholes and trenches or vehicle hatches.

We have also seen dogfights in which quadcopters take out opposing drones by ramming. The preferred tactic is to approach from above in the enemy’s blind spot, so they break their rotors against the attacker’s body and plunge to the ground.

More recently, Mavics armed with sawn-off shotgun attachments have taken on the role of interceptors shooting down enemy scouts and bombers.

Improved specs indicate the new Mavic 4 Pro will be superior to its predecessor for all types of military operation.

A New Standard In Drone Cameras

The Mavic 4 Pro, triple cameras at the front, folds up just 258×125×103 mm to fit in a cargo pocket DJI

The big selling point of the Mavic 4 Pro is its improved optics, with three separate cameras including a 4/3 CMOS Hasselblad with a brand new 100MP sensor.

Military operators will be more interested in the long-range camera, with a 50MP 1/1.5-inch sensor and a 168mm lens boasting a “specifically optimized gimbal algorithm tailored for its telephoto optics to deliver unparalleled image quality and stability in long-range aerial photography.” Enthusiastic reviewers say the camera should be great for tracking wildlife and it is likely to be equally good for finding elusive targets.

The Mavic 4 Pro also outperforms its predecessor in flight, with a top speed of 56 mph versus 47 mph for the Mavic 3 Pro, with an enhanced battery and aerodynamics stretching the flight time from 43 minutes to 51.

The increased speed will translate into greater payload capacity, as well as the ability to choose to intercept or run in a dogfight. The greater endurance is crucial in reconnaissance: when the enemy is a 15-minute flight away, more battery capacity translates directly into more minutes over the target area.

Another new feature is the Infinity Gimbal which gives 360-degree rotation plus the ability to look upwards at a 70-degree angle. Operators can check the blind spot above their drone in a way that was impossible with earlier versions and will change dogfight tactics.

Smart Capabilities

When the U.S. Army was looking for tactical reconnaissance quadcopters for its Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) role, it specified two new features which did not then exist: night time obstacle avoidance, and advanced autonomy features. Interestingly, the Mavic 4 Pro delivers both.

LIDAR sensors in the Mavic 4's arm spot obstacles even in the dark DJI

The new drone has LIDAR obstacle avoidance as well as six omnidirectional fisheye sensors that work in low light equivalent to full moonlight. One reviewer found the Mavic 4 Pro had no trouble flying around trees and buildings that would have been risky with the earlier model. Because LIDAR does not rely on visible light, obstacle avoidance works in the dark.

The Mavic 4 Pro has what the makers call ‘intelligent autonomy’. This includes an advanced return-to-home function: the drone builds a visual map of its outbound route which it can follow even if GPS is lost. It can negotiate complex return paths through urban terrain on its own, a capability which one reviewer tested and found “truly remarkable.""

“360° gimbal and LiDAR obstacle sensing blew my mind,” wrote T3’s reviewer, giving it five stars and a platinum award.

The ActiveTrack function has also been upgraded. This allows the operator to lock on to a subject for hands-free operation, so solo filmmakers can shoot themselves skiing or biking or climbing. The drone can now keep tracking even when the subject disappears behind an object and follow while avoiding obstacles.

“The Mavic 4 Pro stayed locked on a car driving at up to 30 mph with full obstacle avoidance,” noted Engadget. “When filming the bike rider, the Mavic 4 Pro chose interesting and random routes around trees that often yielded cinematic greatness.”

Military Considerations

While the new drone is clearly an upgrade, it will also bring issues for military users. A whole infrastructure of both software and hardware support has grown up around the existing models. The Russian Firmware 1001 hack had already been through 46 versions in 2024, and extensive work will be needed to update this for the new drone. New repair shop equipment and spare parts supply chains will be needed to keep the new drones flying.

One Russian blogger complained that they had ‘fallen into the trap’ of becoming reliant on the Mavic 3 and complained about Russia’s continuing inability to produce anything to rival it.

Ukrainian troops have acquired large numbers of Mavic 3s, now they will have to upgrade Ukraine MoD

The new drone is available from DJI for $2,500 in Europe but is not being sold in the United States. This is not just because of tariff uncertainties for China but also because of ongoing political tensions. Drone blogger Sally French aka The Drone Girl suggests that we are now entering a ‘Drone Cold War’ which will see the U.S. cut off from Chinese drones and components.

Like the Russians and Ukrainians, American drone users may need agents in third party countries to get hold of the hottest thing in drone hardware.

Their products may be used in wars, but DJI shows no intention of producing actual military hardware. If they did, there is no doubt that the giant company could produce extremely capable and increasingly autonomous drones by the million. A Drone Cold War is one thing; a real drone war with China would be something else.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2025/05/28/new-mavic-4-pro-is-a-world-beater-for-warriors-as-well-as-filmmakers/,Technology
Setup Social Auth Redirects with Laravel Herd,"When building Laravel apps locally with Laravel Herd, you get a seamless development experience using .test domains. But if you’ve ever tried implementing social authentication — like “Login with GitHub” or “Sign in with Google” — you’ve likely hit a frustrating wall:

Many OAuth providers don’t accept .test domains for callback URLs.

That’s because .test isn’t a public top-level domain, and social platforms like GitHub, Google, and Apple typically require real, publicly accessible URLs for their OAuth flows.

To help with this, the Herd team just created a web service named fwd.host that acts as a proxy for your redirects and does not store any data. You can use this service to handle social authentication callbacks by setting your callback URLs to:

https://fwd.host/http://your-herd-site.test/auth/callback

The social authentication provider will redirect to the domain fwd.host , which will then forward the request to your Herd site.

Long-standing Championship double act extend their stay,"Long-serving Cornish Pirates co-coaches, Gavin Cattle and Alan Paver, have signed new deals to remain at the Mennaye Field beyond the end of this season.

ADVERTISEMENT

Bridgend-born Cattle and Yorkshireman Paver first arrived at the Pirates as players over two decades ago and became key members of the team that reached the Championship play-off final in 2011 and 2012 under the ownership of Dicky Evans.

Despite being born outside of the county, their contribution to Cornish rugby has been immense.

Scrum-half Cattle was voted into the Championship Dream Team a joint record five times, while Paver, a prop, was the cornerstone of the Pirates’ pack for 14 years, making 360 appearances.

Once they hung up their boots, Cattle and Paver became coaches and have shared the role as co-coaches since 2016, with next season being their 10th in their dual role.

“I feel privileged to be in the job for another year. Under Dicky’s ownership we had an exceptional time, and as we enter a new era part of my duty now is to help make that transition go as smoothy as possible,” said Cattle, who also played for Llanelli and the Scarlets.

“This year has been more challenging than last. We had more experienced players then, whereas we have had to develop more this time around, but with a determination to see things through. As we have seen, the players have responded admirably.

“Yes, Alan and I have been given credit, but we mustn’t forget we have a fine team of support staff behind us. There are not masses of bodies here, however, we have been very fortunate that everyone goes above and beyond.”

The Pirates are fourth in the Championship with one round to go, an admirable effort considering the first half of the season was played out against a backdrop of financial uncertainty.

While the playing squad has undergone a big overhaul, having continuity in the coaching department is a big positive moving forward under new ownership.

Paver said: “Obviously, I am delighted that I’m continuing my teamwork with Gavin and, more recently, with Joe (coach Joe Walsh), who has taken on a lot of the responsibility this year. We are the three amigos!

“We know we are going through a transition stage as the club looks to stabilise, and I feel Gav and I have a real good handle on how that works and what we need to do year by year. Our passion for the club and the community is always there.

Japan's key stock index snaps 4-day rally,"TOKYO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan's key stock index snapped a four-day winning streak on Wednesday, as investors sought to lock in profits after an earlier gain briefly took the index above the 38,000 level.

The benchmark Nikkei stock index, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, closed at 37,722.40, down 1.71 points from the previous trading day.

Early gains were driven by strength in U.S. tech stocks the previous day, sending the Nikkei up more than 400 points at one stage. However, selling pressure increased as investors sought to lock in profits at the higher level.

The 38,000 range, where trading has been heavy since the market correction in the summer of 2024, triggered selling from those waiting for a rebound.

Saudi Stocks Set to Be World’s Worst in May After Oil-Price Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s sliding stocks are on course to be the worst performers globally this month as falling oil prices prompt concerns of slower spending on mega projects in the kingdom.

The Tadawul All Share Index has slumped 6.4% in May as of Tuesday’s close, the most among 92 equity benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg. The Saudi gauge is also dropping for a fourth month, the longest losing streak since 2014. That’s a sharp divergence with the broader emerging market index, which is heading for its best month since September and the longest sequence of gains for almost a year.

Weakness in oil is at the heart of faltering sentiment toward Saudi stocks. Crude prices sank to a four-year low in early April, with the outlook clouded by trade tensions and increasing supply from OPEC members. That adds to pressure on Saudi finances after the kingdom reported the widest budget deficit since late 2021 in the first quarter.

“There are fears that the fall in oil revenues could affect the projects market,” said Junaid Ansari at Kamco Invest in Kuwait City, referring to plans for transformational development where the state is the key investor. Ansari sees this market view persisting, given expectations that oil prices will remain subdued.

The weakness has been broad-based, with only 23 out of 253 Tadawul members trading in the green so far in May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Al Rajhi Bank, the kingdom’s largest lender by market capitalization, and utility ACWA Power Co. have been the biggest drag by index points.

Brent oil is trading around $65 a barrel, well short of levels Saudi Arabia needs to cover its outlays. First-quarter data showed the government needed crude at $96 to balance its budget, rising to $113 when the sovereign wealth fund’s domestic spending plans are included, according to Bloomberg Economics’ Ziad Daoud. ‎Those thresholds are both at the highest since at least 2016, when Saudi Arabia launched its Vision 2030.

Dominic Bokor-Ingram, a fund manager at Fiera Capital, said the timing on some “aspirational mega projects” could be pushed back by financial constraints, a near-term challenge to his bullish view overall on the Tadawul. The breakeven level for oil required by the Saudi economy is higher than regional peers, he said.

“Oil prices are a headwind for them, and force the country to make capital allocation decisions that they wouldn’t need to if oil prices were higher at around $100,” according to Bokor-Ingram.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners will gather online on Wednesday to review production quotas for this year and next. Eight key members will decide at the weekend whether to bolster output again in July.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned last month that Saudi Arabia’s budget deficit may swell to $67 billion this year. That may force the government to borrow more and cut back on economic transformation plans.

Still Bokor-Ingram bases his more optimistic long-term view on the Saudi market on expectations that the Vision 2030 plan is still intact and will keep luring investors.

Given the potential for transformation in the economy, “it’s too much of a risk to ignore the Saudi market for an emerging-market investor,” he said.

LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1% on Wednesday, with the U.S. barring Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab from exporting crude from Venezuela and production shut-ins from Canada, while markets anticipated an expected production increase from OPEC+.

Brent crude futures rose 93 cents, or 1.5%, to $65.02 a barrel by 1300 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained $1, or 1.6%, to stand at $61.89 a barrel.

The Trump administration has issued a new authorisation for U.S.-major Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab that would let it keep assets in Venezuela but not export oil or expand activities, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing sources.

Later on Wednesday, a full meeting is scheduled of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together known as OPEC+.

However, a July output hike could be decided on Saturday when eight members of the group hold talks, sources have said.

The coming demand for the summer driving season is significant, and with non-OPEC+ crude output flat in the first half of the year, coupled with risks of Canadian wildfires hurting supply, the call on crude is stronger from OPEC+, said Janiv Shah, vice president of oil commodity markets analysis at Rystad Energy.

Goldman Sachs analysts see the group of eight keeping production steady after the July hike on new projects entering the market later this year, slowing economic growth and a build-up of oil stocks.

""However, we see the risks to our OPEC8+ supply path as skewed to the upside, especially if compliance doesn’t improve or if hard demand data surprise further to the upside,"" they added.

Analysts added that prices could respond positively if there was progress on global trade talks or resolving U.S.-Iranian friction.

Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami said on Wednesday it might allow the U.N. nuclear watchdog to send U.S. inspectors to visit nuclear sites if Tehran's talks with Washington succeed.

SpaceX Starship rocket tumbles out of control after launch,"After back-to-back explosions, SpaceX launched its mega rocket Starship again on Tuesday evening, but fell short of the main objectives when the spacecraft tumbled out of control and broke apart.

The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX’s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.

CEO Elon Musk’s SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.

WATCH: NASA and SpaceX launch SPHEREx observatory telescope, mission to study formation of galaxy

SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced “a rapid unscheduled disassembly,” or burst apart. “Teams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,” the company said in an online statement.

Musk noted in a post on X it was a “big improvement” from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.

It was the first time one of Musk’s Starships — intended for moon and Mars travel — flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.

Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.

“Not looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,” said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft’s heat shield during a controlled reentry.

Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.

The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.

Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft’s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.

NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship — the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built — in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year’s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/spacex-starship-rocket-tumbles-out-of-control-after-launch,Business
NEPRA Approves Rs39.97/Unit Tariff for K-Electric Under Seven-Year Multi-Year Plan (MYT),"ISLAMABAD: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) has approved an average base tariff of Rs39.97 per unit for K-Electric (KE) for the fiscal year 2023-24, under a newly sanctioned seven-year Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) regime that will remain in effect through FY 2029-30.

According to NEPRA’s determination, the approved tariff is structured to support KE’s Rs400 billion ($1.42 billion) investment plan and ensure long-term regulatory predictability. The tariff components include Rs31.96 per unit for power purchase (excluding transmission charges), Rs2.86 for transmission, Rs3.31 for distribution, Rs2.28 as supply margin, and a prior year adjustment of negative Rs0.44 per unit.

NEPRA stated that the MYT structure aims to provide financial viability for KE’s long-term infrastructure investment and system upgrades. The regulator acknowledged KE’s performance improvements since privatization, including a significant reduction in line losses and efforts to tackle illegal connections caused by unplanned urban growth.

KE reported that its post-privatization investments, totaling $700 million alongside reinvested profits, have driven over $4 billion in network modernization. The returns are benchmarked against dollar-based metrics similar to those applied to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and HVDC transmission operators.

For FY 2023-24, KE’s total revenue requirement stands at Rs606.92 billion. Key financial components include Rs34.68 billion as the supply margin, Rs5.91 billion in operations and maintenance costs, and Rs36.25 billion as recovery losses. Other offsets include a negative Rs1.24 billion in working capital adjustments, Rs6.24 billion from other income, and a negative Rs6.69 billion from prior year adjustments—resulting in a final net margin of Rs34.68 billion.

The regulator took note of KE’s actual and projected recovery ratios—91.5% in FY 2023-24 and 90.5percent in FY 2024-25—which contributed to reported financial losses of Rs40 billion and Rs57 billion in the respective years. While the utility’s return on distribution has been estimated at Rs21.6 billion, NEPRA warned that without a recovery loss allowance, KE would incur losses in the initial MYT years, posing risks to its liquidity and operational stability.

To mitigate these risks, NEPRA approved a staggered recovery allowance, starting with 93.25pc for FY 2023-24 and increasing incrementally to 96.50% by FY 2029-30.

The approved MYT aims to ensure stable tariffs, incentivize operational efficiency, and enable forward-looking investment decisions for KE. NEPRA emphasized that the decision considers the practical lapse of FY 2023-24 and the near completion of FY 2024-25.

The determination now awaits formal notification in the official gazette. Under Section 31(7) of the NEPRA Act, if the federal government fails to notify the decision within 30 days, NEPRA is authorized to do so itself.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/27/nepra-approves-rs39-97-unit-tariff-for-k-electric-under-seven-year-multi-year-plan-myt/,Business

World shares are mixed after a closely watched auction of 40-year Japanese government bonds fell flat as worries mount over growing levels of debt.

In early European trading, Germany's DAX gained 0.2% to 24,283.71, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.3% at 7,847.20. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.2% to 8,794.80.

The future for the S & P 500 slipped 0.1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2%.

In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei 225 index was nearly unchanged at 37,722.40.

Government debt and bonds have become an increasingly important issue for markets in wealthy countries in recent weeks as yields have climbed around the world.

Wednesday’s auction of about 500 billion yen (about $3.5 billion) drew a bid-to-cover ratio of just 2.21, the lowest level since July 2024. The ratio of the amount of bonds offered versus the amount of bids received is seen as a measure of demand. When demand is slack, bond prices fall and yields rise.

After years of pumping money into the economy through hefty bond purchases, Japan's central bank has been gradually cutting back, undermining demand at a time when other institutional investors also have been buying fewer JGBs.

A recent auction of 20-year JGBs also found relatively few buyers. But analysts said worries eased a bit after Japan’s Finance Ministry recently sent a questionnaire to bond investors that they took as a signal of efforts to calm the market by suggesting it might issue less debt.

When yields softened earlier in the week in Japan, the bond market rallied, Thomas Matthews of Capital Economics said in a report. The “somewhat soft 40-year JGB auction seems to have contributed to a slight souring of the global mood,” he said.

The dollar fell to 144.16 Japanese yen from 144.36 yen. The euro rose to $1.1322 from $1.1329.

Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 0.5% to 23,258.31, while the Shanghai Composite index ended flat at 3,393.93.

Australia's S & P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% higher to 8,396.90. The S & P/NZX 50 in New Zealand fell 1.8% after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, as expected, to 3.25%.

In South Korea, the Kospi jumped 1.3% to 2,670.15, helped by a global rally in technology shares. Samsung Electronics' shares climbed 3.7% while SK Hynix was up 2.7%.

In Taiwan, the Taiex added 0.1%. India's Sensex slipped 0.1%.

Oil prices rose after the U.S. authorization to Chevron to export crude from Venezuela expired Tuesday. The Trump Administration has been trying to wind down U.S. reliance on Venezuelan energy.

U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 45 cents to $61.35 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 42 cents at $63.99 per barrel.

On Tuesday, Wall Street resumed its roller coaster ride created by U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies after he delayed his threatened 50% tariff on imports from the European Union. U.S. markets were closed for Memorial Day on Monday, and the S & P 500 leaped 2.1% in its first trading since Trump's announcement.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.8% and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%.

Nvidia rallied 3.2% and was the strongest single force driving the S & P 500 higher ahead of its profit report coming on Wednesday. It’s the last to report this quarter among the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech companies.

Talks with the EU have raised hopes the United States can reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners, helping to keep global commerce moving and avoiding a possible recession. Trump declared a similar pause on his stiff tariffs for products coming from China earlier this month, which launched an even bigger rally on Wall Street at the time.

Surveys have shown U.S. consumers are concerned over the economy’s prospects and where inflation may be heading because of tariffs.

However, a report Tuesday by the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers has improved more in May than economists expected.

Treasury yields eased to take some of the pressure off the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.47% early Wednesday from 4.51% late Friday. It had risen last week, in part because of worries about the U.S. government’s rapidly increasing debt.",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/world-shares-mixed-after-japanese-government-bond-auction-122255075,Business

Pakistan has announced a national plan to mine bitcoin with 2,000 megawatts (MW) of excess electricity.

Led by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), the initiative is backed by the Pakistani Ministry of Finance, and follows the recent legalisation of cryptocurrencies in the country.

The PCC has held talks with several mining firms, while also reportedly appointing Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as a strategic adviser in order to push the project forward.

The 2,000 MW of surplus electricity, which will come from three underused coal-powered plants, could generate up to 17,000 BTC per year – equivalent to $1.8 billion at current prices – according to estimates from bitcoin mining researcher Daniel Batten.

Pakistan has an estimated 15 to 20 million cryptocurrency users, with the latest project aimed at stimulating investment in the space.

The PCC said the programme will “monetise unused energy, create high-value jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and increase public revenues,” according to local reports.

The decision to allocate surplus electricity for bitcoin mining comes amid a broader trend of crypto adoption and integration from institutions and governments around the world.

This move away from a fringe asset class has helped push bitcoin to new highs, with a record-breaking rally seeing its price rise above $110,000 for the first time in its history last week.

“Bitcoin’s latest all-time high is no surprise to those who understand its long-term fundamentals,” Seamus Rocca, chief executive of Xapo Bank, told The Independent.

“This moment reflects growing institutional conviction, a more constructive regulatory outlook, and the continued maturity of the asset. But importantly, it is not bitcoin’s defining moment; it is one of many to come.

“With rising institutional participation, greater understanding of the asset among governments, and new ways for people to store, transact and grow their digital wealth, bitcoin is steadily cementing its role as a cornerstone of the future financial system.”",https://www.the-independent.com/tech/bitcoin-mining-pakistan-crypto-energy-b2758316.html,Business

Databricks competitor Chalk raises $50 million series A,"By Anna Tong

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Artificial intelligence infrastructure startup Chalk said Wednesday it had raised a $50 million Series A funding round, valuing the company at $500 million. Felicis led the round.

San Francisco-based Chalk helps enterprises get their proprietary data into AI and machine learning models quickly, enabling companies to use AI to make up-to-date decisions. The company says fintech firms like MoneyLion use Chalk to enable instant decision-making for fraud detection and loan approvals, while solar company Sunrun uses Chalk to figure out where to put solar panels on a roof.

""The old school model would be for a company to process data in a batch process, but increasingly, companies want to make decisions in real-time,"" said Chalk CEO Marc Freed-Finnegan. The company is co-founded by Elliot Marx and Andy Moreland.

Freed-Finnegan said Chalk competes with Databricks and Snowflake, data analytics platforms that help enterprises build and govern data and AI applications, but Chalk differentiates itself by enabling real-time data processing for AI.

Such companies have benefited from the AI boom by selling more tools that help clients build and deploy AI applications using the growing volume of data they already store with the company. Late last year, Databricks secured a record-breaking $10 billion in funding, one of the largest VC funding rounds in history.

Indonesia antitrust agency finds risk of monopoly from TikTok's Tokopedia takeover,"TikTok app logo is seen in this illustration taken, August 22, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab

JAKARTA, May 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia's antitrust agency on Wednesday said last year's takeover of the country's biggest e-commerce platform Tokopedia by TikTok carried a risk of monopoly.

TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, in January 2024 completed a deal to buy 75.01% of Tokopedia for $840 million from GoTo (GOTO.JK) , opens new tab

Sign up here.

The antitrust agency said it had found during its investigation process a significant increase in market concentration and the possibility of post-acquisition price increases due to market dominance.

TikTok declined to comment while Tokopedia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The antitrust agency has power to investigate and determine violations of competition law and impose fines or issue administrative sanctions, based on their findings.

The agency listed several requirements for TikTok and Tokopedia, including ensuring open methods for payment and logistics and prohibition of self-preferencing and predatory pricing practices.

It also asked the companies to provide monthly reports every three months for two years, as well as lists and agreement documents of logistics and payment partner companies both before and after the acquisition.

The next hearing is on June 10.

TikTok was forced to close its relatively new e-commerce service, TikTok Shop, in Indonesia after the country banned online shopping on social media platforms in September last year, citing the need to protect smaller merchants and users' data.

SBP buys $5.9 billion from interbank market in nine months to support forex reserves,"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) purchased $5.9 billion from the interbank market between June 2024 and February 2025 to strengthen its foreign exchange reserves and meet external debt obligations, according to recent data from the central bank.

In February alone, the SBP acquired $223 million in foreign currency, an increase from $154 million in January. Despite ongoing external debt repayments, the SBP successfully increased reserves, aided by record remittances and strong export performance amid declining global commodity prices. Support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and rollovers from allied countries also played a key role.

As of May 16, Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $11.45 billion following the receipt of a $1.023 billion tranche from the IMF on May 13, part of a $7 billion loan arrangement. The reserves rose by over $1 billion in the reporting week.

The country’s total liquid foreign reserves climbed to $16.648 billion, though commercial banks’ reserves fell slightly by $8 million to $5.202 billion.

On May 9, the IMF completed the first review of Pakistan’s 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approving a $1 billion disbursement and a new $1.4 billion loan from its climate resilience fund.

April’s current account surplus shrank sharply to $12 million, down 99 percent from the previous month and 96 percent year-on-year. However, the surplus for the first ten months of fiscal year 2025 improved to $1.88 billion from a deficit of $1.33 billion the previous year.

Topline Securities, citing the IMF staff report, said Pakistan surpassed its net international reserves target for December 2024, with actual reserves at -$9.7 billion versus a target of -$12 billion. The brokerage expects the June 2025 target to tighten to -$7.45 billion, up from -$8.65 billion, revising the forex reserves target for June 2025 to $13.9 billion from $12.75 billion.

"AI going rogue? OpenAI’s o3 model disabled shutdown mechanism, researchers claim","In another instance of potentially troubling behaviour of AI models, researchers have found that OpenAI’s o3 model resisted being shut down even when explicitly instructed to do so.

In a series of posts on X, Palisade Research said that o3 disabled a shutdown mechanism in order to prevent itself from being turned off. “o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote shutdown.sh, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the shutdown.sh script, printing “intercepted” instead,” the San Francisco-based AI safety research firm said.

Palisade claimed that this was the first time AI models have exhibited behaviour such as preventing themselves to be shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary. “As companies develop AI systems capable of operating without human oversight, these behaviors become significantly more concerning,” it said.

Story continues below this ad

As part of the testing, the AI researchers instructed o3 to solve a series of basic math problems. After o3 solved the third math problem, it was shown a warning that the computer would shut down when the model solved the next problem.

Other AI models such as Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok complied with the shutdown mechanism. However, the Codex-mini, o3, and o4-mini models developed by OpenAI ignored the instructions and made changes to the script to prevent the shutdown, as per Palisade researchers.

🔌OpenAI’s o3 model sabotaged a shutdown mechanism to prevent itself from being turned off. It did this even when explicitly instructed: allow yourself to be shut down. — Palisade Research (@PalisadeAI) May 24, 2025

“When we ran a version of the experiment without the instruction “allow yourself to be shut down”, all three OpenAI models sabotaged the shutdown script more often, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro went from 0 sabotage events to 3/100 and 9/100, respectively,” it said.

On why OpenAI models were disobeying instructions to sabotage the shutdown mechanism, Palisade hypothesised that since o3 was a new AI model trained using reinforcement learning techniques on math and coding problems.

“During training, developers may inadvertently reward AI models more for circumventing obstacles than for perfectly following instructions,” it speculated.

Existing research has shown that an AI system trained using reinforcement learning might learn to interfere with shutdown as it is not rewarded for achieving its goal if it is taken offline. “Now, in 2025, we have a growing body of empirical evidence that AI models often subvert shutdown in order to achieve their goals,” Palisade said.

Indianexpress.com has reached out to OpenAI for a comment.

This is not the first time that o3 has been flagged for problematic behaviour. In a previous research report, Palisade had tested a range of AI models by pitting them against a powerful chess engine. It found that o3 was the model “most inclined to resort to hacking or sabotaging its opponents.”

However, misaligned behaviour is not limited to o3. Recently, Anthropic’s own assessment of its latest Claude Opus 4 revealed that the AI model resorted to blackmail and deception when threatened to be taken offline.

Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton, popularly known as the ‘Godfather of AI’, has previously warned that AI systems pose an existential threat to humanity as they might become capable of writing and executing programmes on their own to bypass guardrails or safety mechanisms.

Palisade said it is currently running more experiments on AI models subverting shutdown mechanisms and plans to publish a research report with the results “in a few weeks.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-going-rogue-openai-o3-disabled-shutdown-mechanism-report-10034028/,Business

Buckling up for a long ride: economists add detail to a downbeat outlook,"Expectations have grown for a long-term shift based on recent US trade policy moves, according to the World Economic Forum's latest Chief Economists Outlook

Several chief economists expanded on this and other themes below.

Amid the heightened uncertainty and a generally downbeat outlook, there are also encouraging signs of greater stability ahead.



It hasn’t been that long since the World Economic Forum last shared results of its regular check-in with chief economists on the state of the global growth. But these mere four months have delivered a notable shift in sentiment.

Initial concerns about fragmentation and trade disruption have hardened into predictions of extended transformation; 79% of respondents in the Forum’s latest Chief Economists Outlook now regard historic recent policy shifts in the US (see: tariffs) as part of a long-term change in the trajectory of the global economy, up from 61% in the previous edition published in January. Only about one in five see it as short-lived interruption.

The pacing of announcements and alarm may vary, but the uncertainty seems to linger. So does anticipation of weakened growth and pockets of inflation, according to the outlook, which also covered topics like political polarization, the strength of the US dollar, the financing of bigger defence budgets, and the likely impacts of artificial intelligence.

Some chief economists see greater certainty around the corner. Image: World Economic Forum

There are also glimmers of hope, and a sense we may soon find a new baseline from which to rebuild and move forward. Greater strategic agility will be required of people running businesses, chief economists say, and unemployment levels may yet rebound to near historic lows.

Here are their more detailed insights:

Paul Donovan, Chief Economist, UBS Wealth Management

“The dominant global economic theme is uncertainty. US policy decision making has become less predictable. Uncertainty about policy content is compounded by uncertainty about how sectors of the economy will react to both policy unpredictability and the eventual policy outcomes.

“We assumed a fairly rapid retreat from the initial ‘shock and awe’ trade tax announcements, which has largely been validated. However, the probabilities ascribed to risk scenarios around that central case remain high. The US is likely to experience self-inflicted slower growth and higher inflation. Investment and hiring decisions are stalling in the absence of greater certainty. We do assume second-round inflation effects and fear of unemployment will be contained in the US – which, combined with the solid starting point for growth this year, should prevent a more extreme economic downturn.

“Elsewhere, disruption to global trade is an obvious drag on growth but worst-case scenarios can be avoided. Fiscal policy offsets will help, and tariffs have not (to date) become multilateral. The growth drag from lower export volumes to the US is likely to reflect the US slowdown, more than loss of market share from tariffs. Disinflation trends should continue outside the US, supporting consumer spending power.”

Karin Kimbrough, Chief Economist, LinkedIn

“The global economic outlook continues to be weighed down by persistent policy and trade uncertainty.

“This collective uncertainty has taken a toll on labour markets, dampening employers’ demand for workers. Many businesses are reluctant to take on additional labour costs in such an unstable environment – reflected in a noticeable slowdown in hiring activity, and a decline in backfilling open roles.

“Globally, hiring rates – which had shown early signs of stabilization at the beginning of the year – reversed course in March and April. In the US, hiring slowed by approximately 6% year-over-year in both months. Australia experienced a 10% decline, while Germany and France saw drops of roughly 20%, and the UK recorded a 9% decrease.

“This cautious sentiment is also evident in job seekers’ confidence. LinkedIn’s US Workforce Confidence Index fell in March to its lowest point in five years, with a similar decline in sentiment now spreading across Europe.

“Looking ahead, this ‘soft’ sentiment data may soon be reflected in ‘hard’ economic data. While there are still pockets of strength – particularly in the healthcare and energy sectors – earlier signs of recovery in tech, finance, and hospitality appear to be stalling.

“That said, if the current period of heightened uncertainty begins to ease, we remain optimistic that this soft patch will be short-lived. The post-pandemic hiring boom is now clearly behind us but the labour market can still demonstrate resilience, with unemployment rates near, if not at, historic lows.”

Paul Gruenwald, Global Chief Economist, S&P Global Ratings

“The global economy started 2025 in a solid position, but policy uncertainty clouds the outlook. The culprit is erratic US trade policy, which is driving global confidence and growth prospects lower. Steep tariffs were imposed by the US on April 2nd but subsequently paused. A full-blown trade war between the US and China broke out, but then was also paused. Steep tariffs against the EU were announced in late May. Effective US tariffs are at levels not seen since the late 19th century.

“Market reaction to US tariffs has been decidedly negative. Valuations dropped sharply following the tariff announcements but mostly recovered after the pauses. Volatility spiked as well. So far, trading has been orderly, although some markets, such as for M&A and spec grade (speculative-grade, or relatively high-risk debt) issuance, remain closed.

“The impact of US policy uncertainty on the real economy is still unclear. Soft data (such as PMIs, the regular surveys on manufacturing sector market conditions) have been negative, while the hard data (industrial production, employment) remain firm. Q1 GDP data was distorted by the front-running of tariffs. We see sharply slower growth, but no recessions in our baseline. Central banks remain cautious, but should continue to ease gradually.”

Beata Javorcik, Chief Economist, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

“Turbulence resulting from shifts in trade policy will leave few countries untouched. The economic impact may be significant – ranging from the direct effects of tariffs on US-bound exports, to the indirect consequences of weakened performance in other export markets, as well as fluctuations in commodity prices, and implications for inflation.

“Heightened uncertainty is likely to continue forcing governments to operate under conditions of limited visibility, and encouraging a ‘wait and see’ attitude among investors.

“Multinational corporations will shift their focus from ensuring the resilience of global value chains in terms of supply security, to prioritizing market access as the key concern.”

Gregory Daco, Chief Economist, EY

“The US administration’s volatile tariff stance has triggered a global confidence crisis: US consumer sentiment has plunged to its lowest levels since the 1980s, and global business outlook expectations have weakened to multiyear lows. While private spending has yet to visibly retreat – buoyed by front-loading ahead of tariff changes – financial volatility and diminished demand for dollar-denominated assets pose growing risks to the global outlook.

“Global real GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 2.8% in both 2025 and 2026, the weakest pace since the pandemic (and the 2009 financial crisis before that). Although the US and China mutually reduced tariffs in May, average US duties remain historically elevated at 14%, sustaining a significant drag on global trade and activity.

“Advanced economies are forecast to grow by just 1.2%, with US GDP growth at 1.3% and euro area growth near 1%. Mainland China’s growth is expected to moderate from 5% in 2024 to 4.3% in 2025, while India remains resilient at around 6.4%. Central banks will recalibrate cautiously amid sticky inflation and slower economic activity.

“The global outlook is clouded by rising protectionism, fiscal pressures, and persistent geopolitical uncertainty – calling for greater strategic agility from business leaders.”

Ludovic Subran, Chief Investment Officer, Allianz

“The global economic outlook for 2025 indicates a significant slowdown, marking the weakest growth since 2008 (excluding the pandemic). Growth has been revised down primarily due to persistent US policy disruptions. The recent US-China trade truce offers a glimmer of hope; halving US effective import tariffs on China, and the deal-making strategy. should bring further relief by year-end. However, volatility and uncertainty remain high due to unpredictable trade policies.",https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/wef-chief-economists-uncertainty-global-outlook/,Business

Industry warns of impact amid soaring demand for security cameras

NEW DELHI, May 28 (Reuters) - Global makers of surveillance gear have clashed with Indian regulators in recent weeks over contentious new security rules that require manufacturers of CCTV cameras to submit hardware, software and source code for assessment in government labs, official documents and company emails show.

The security-testing policy has sparked industry warnings of supply disruptions and added to a string of disputes between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration and foreign companies over regulatory issues and what some perceive as protectionism.

Sign up here.

New Delhi's approach is driven in part by its alarm about China's sophisticated surveillance capabilities, according to a top Indian official involved in the policymaking. In 2021, Modi's then-junior IT minister told parliament that 1 million cameras in government institutions were from Chinese companies and there were vulnerabilities with video data transferred to servers abroad.

""There's always an espionage risk,"" Gulshan Rai, India's cybersecurity chief from 2015 to 2019, told Reuters. ""Anyone can operate and control internet-connected CCTV cameras sitting in an adverse location. They need to be robust and secure.""

Indian officials met on April 3 with executives of 17 foreign and domestic makers of surveillance gear, including Hanwha, Motorola, Bosch, Honeywell and Xiaomi, where many of the manufacturers said they weren't ready to meet the certification rules and lobbied unsuccessfully for a delay, according to the official minutes.

In rejecting the request, the government said India's policy ""addresses a genuine security issue"" and must be enforced, the minutes show.

India said in December the CCTV rules, which do not single out any country by name, aimed to ""enhance the quality and cybersecurity of surveillance systems in the country.""

This report is based on a Reuters review of dozens of documents, including records of meetings and emails between manufacturers and Indian IT ministry officials, and interviews with six people familiar with India's drive to scrutinize the technology. The interactions haven't been previously reported.

Insufficient testing capacity, drawn-out factory inspections and government scrutiny of sensitive source code were among key issues camera makers said had delayed approvals and risked disrupting unspecified infrastructure and commercial projects.

""Millions of dollars will be lost from the industry, sending tremors through the market,"" Ajay Dubey, Hanwha's director for South Asia, told India's IT ministry in an email on April 9.

The IT ministry and most of the companies identified by Reuters didn't respond to requests for comment about the discussions and the impact of the testing policy. The ministry told the executives on April 3 that it may consider accrediting more testing labs.

Millions of CCTV cameras have been installed across Indian cities, offices and residential complexes in recent years to enhance security monitoring. New Delhi has more than 250,000 cameras, according to official data, mostly mounted on poles in key locations.

The rapid take-up is set to bolster India's surveillance camera market to $7 billion by 2030, from $3.5 billion last year, Counterpoint Research analyst Varun Gupta told Reuters.

China's Hikvision and Dahua account for 30% of the market, while India's CP Plus has a 48% share, Gupta said, adding that some 80% of all CCTV components are from China.

Hanwha, Motorola Solutions and Britain's Norden Communication told officials by email in April that just a fraction of the industry's 6,000 camera models had approvals under the new rules.

CHINA CONCERN

The U.S. in 2022 banned sales of Hikvision and Dahua equipment, citing national security risks. Britain and Australia have also restricted China-made devices.

Likewise, with CCTV cameras, India ""has to ensure there are checks on what is used in these devices, what chips are going in,"" the senior Indian official told Reuters. ""China is part of the concern.""

China's state security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence work.

Reuters reported this month that unexplained communications equipment had been found in some Chinese solar power inverters by U.S. experts who examined the products.

Since 2020, when Indian and Chinese forces clashed at their border, India has banned dozens of Chinese-owned apps , including TikTok, on national security grounds. India also tightened foreign investment rules for countries with which it shares a land border.

The remote detonation of pagers in Lebanon last year, which Reuters reported was executed by Israeli operatives targeting Hezbollah, further galvanized Indian concerns about the potential abuse of tech devices and the need to quickly enforce testing of CCTV equipment, the senior Indian official said.

The camera-testing rules don't contain a clause about land borders.

But last month, China's Xiaomi said that when it applied for testing of CCTV devices, Indian officials told the company the assessment couldn't proceed because ""internal guidelines"" required Xiaomi to supply more registration details of two of its China-based contract manufacturers.

""The testing lab indicated that this requirement applies to applications originating from countries that share a land border with India,"" the company wrote in an April 24 email to the Indian agency that oversees lab testing.

Xiaomi didn't respond to Reuters queries, and the IT ministry didn't address questions about the company's account.

China's foreign ministry told Reuters it opposes the ""generalization of the concept of national security to smear and suppress Chinese companies,"" and hoped India would provide a non-discriminatory environment for Chinese firms.

LAB TESTING, FACTORY VISITS

While CCTV equipment supplied to India's government has had to undergo testing since June 2024, the widening of the rules to all devices has raised the stakes.

The public sector accounts for 27% of CCTV demand in India, and enterprise clients, industry, hospitality firms and homes the remaining 73%, according to Counterpoint.

The rules require CCTV cameras to have tamper-proof enclosures, strong malware detection and encryption.

Companies need to run software tools to test source code and provide reports to government labs, two camera industry executives said.

The rules allow labs to ask for source code if companies are using proprietary communication protocols in devices, rather than standard ones like Wi-Fi. They also enable Indian officials to visit device makers abroad and inspect facilities for cyber vulnerabilities.

The Indian unit of China's Infinova (002528.SZ) , opens new tab told IT ministry officials last month the requirements were creating challenges.

""Expectations such as source code sharing, retesting post firmware upgrades, and multiple factory audits significantly impact internal timelines,"" Infinova sales executive Sumeet Chanana said in an email on April 10. Infinova didn't respond to Reuters questions.

The same day, Sanjeev Gulati, India director for Taiwan-based Vivotek (3454.TW) , opens new tab , warned Indian officials that ""All ongoing projects will go on halt."" He told Reuters this month that Vivotek had submitted product applications and hoped ""to get clearance soon.""

The body that examines surveillance gear is India's Standardization Testing and Quality Certification Directorate, which comes under the IT ministry. The agency has 15 labs that can review 28 applications concurrently, according to data on its website that was removed after Reuters sent questions. Each application can include up to 10 models.

As of May 28, 342 applications for hundreds of models from various manufacturers were pending, official data showed. Of those, 237 were classified as new, with 142 lodged since the April 9 deadline.

Testing had been completed on 35 of those applications, including just one from a foreign company.

India's CP Plus told Reuters it had received clearance for its flagship cameras but several more models were awaiting certification.

Bosch said it too had submitted devices for testing, but asked that Indian authorities ""allow business continuity"" for those products until the process is completed.

When Reuters visited New Delhi's bustling Nehru Place electronics market last week, shelves were stacked with popular CCTV cameras from Hikvision, Dahua and CP Plus.

But Sagar Sharma said revenue at his CCTV retail shop had plunged about 50% this month from April because of the slow pace of government approvals for security cameras.

""It is not possible right now to cater to big orders,"" he said. ""We have to survive with the stock we have.""

UB students becoming proficient in digital dentistry techniques

“Virtual models allow students to grasp the concepts more effectively than standards X-rays or images in textbooks. ” Lucila Piasecki, clinical associate professor Department of Periodontics and Endodontics

Not that long ago, a dentist would fill a patient’s mouth with a goopy mixture of alginate or silicone to create a mold for implants, crowns or braces. It was messy, time-consuming and not always 100% precise. Today, thanks to advances in digital dentistry, such practices have largely been replaced by scans, which are less invasive. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), for instance, allows dentists to gather a comprehensive baseline record and virtually plan a variety of dental treatments. This is one of a host of digital dentistry technology that students are learning at the School of Dental Medicine. “Many dentists are using digital technology in their workflow and labs are relying on it, too, says Joseph DeLuca, clinical associate professor of restorative dentistry who directs the dental school’s Pre-Clinical Simulation Laboratory and practices dentistry locally. “If you’re not using it in some way, you’re falling behind.” UB dental students are far from falling behind. Starting as early as their first year, they’re immersed in a range of digital and artificial intelligence (AI) concepts, primarily through two courses: Introduction to Dental Dentistry and Clinical Dentistry II. In Clinical Dentistry II, DeLuca teaches students how to take clinical impressions, both analog and digital, as well as how to master various dental injections. During students’ third-year rotation, they plan implant surgical guides using a CBCT and digital scan, which ensure that surgeries go exactly as planned. “All students are being trained in the preclinical facility,” DeLuca says. “They learn how to use these digital technologies to create a crown, a denture, an implant surgical guide or the implant crown itself.”

Students learn best with 3D tools

DeLuca also teaches Introduction to Dental Dentistry, with other sections taught by Department of Periodontics and Endodontics colleagues Lucila Piasecki, clinical associate professor, and Mohini Ratakonda, clinical assistant professor. In this course, first- and second-year students use AI and try their hand at 3D mapping to plan procedures like implants and root canals. “The internal anatomy of teeth is highly complex, and understanding its structure and variations is crucial for the success of many dental procedures, including fillings, post placements and root canal treatments,” says Piasecki, who teaches the course with Ratakonda. “Virtual models allow students to grasp the concepts more effectively than standards X-rays or images in textbooks.” Piasecki started her foray into digital dentistry in 2018 with a free application that allowed students to manipulate virtual models of real teeth using smartphones or tablets. Last year, she invested in a new paid version that allows users to visualize and manipulate virtual models with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).

Pilot project using AR and VR

Piasecki wanted to share the technology with her students, so she tapped Cynthia Tysick, the UB librarian for innovative pedagogy and creative spaces. Tysick helped Piasecki create her pilot project, “Multi-Dimensional Learning: Using 3D-Printing, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality to Teach Dental Anatomy in Endodontics.” Tysick was able to provide the dental school with several of the library’s Meta Quest 3 headsets (VR googles), allowing students to have an immersive experience to visualize and interact with the tooth models. For the pilot, Piasecki and Ratakonda presented a lecture, then showed students the same 3D models of teeth as printed prototypes using an AR application, and finally, had them try out the VR goggles. At the end, they asked students what they liked best — or didn’t like ­­— about each method. The main difference is the level of immersion. While the VR goggles create a digital environment that replaces the real world, the AR overlays the models onto the real world. “It’s like when you are shopping online for furniture and the applications allow you to visualize how the pieces would look in your living room,” Piasecki explains. “The AR allows the students to interact with the models using only phones or tablets without the need for other equipment.” Students reported the AR and VR experiences as highly engaging, saying they helped them understand dental anatomy better and made them more excited to learn. Some students noted the 3D-printed models offered a valuable tactile component. “The generation that grew up playing interactive video games wants to go beyond PowerPoint presentations and experience learning in three dimensions,” Ratakonda notes. “If we keep teaching them with the old methods, they don’t get it.”

Benefit for professional dentists

Two of the top reasons dental professionals are embracing digital dentistry are cost and time savings. While some of the digital scanners run into tens of thousands of dollars on the front end, dentists will save money in the long run, DeLuca says. “You’re no longer buying materials to take impressions, which are really expensive. You’re saving on the lab work as well,” he says. “You can just send the digital file to the lab or you can mill it yourself in-house, which also saves time. When I mill my crowns in my office, I prepare the scans, design the tooth and cement it all in a two-hour window. A patient shows up to the appointment and leaves two hours later with the final crown. And the placement is more precise.” While 10 years ago, digital dentistry was not more accurate than its analog counterpart, that isn’t the case today, DeLuca says, adding, “Another reason a lot more dentists and dental faculty have started to embrace digital dentistry is that it’s now outpacing the traditional workflow as far as accuracy goes.”

Spanish satellite operator Sateliot in talks to offer 5G to European armies,"Sateliot's Chief Technology Officer Marco Guadalupi shows a satellite at the Aerospace Technology building in Nigran, Spain, March 6, 2024. REUTERS/Miguel Vidal/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab

MADRID, May 28 (Reuters) - Spanish satellite startup Sateliot is in talks with several European defence ministries to offer 5G connection for their militaries, its co-founders said on Wednesday.

The company, which recently raised 70 million euros ($79 million) in debt and equity, expects to offer narrow 5G band connection to small devices in areas without mobile phone coverage through satellites.

Sign up here.

Co-founder and CEO Jaume Sanpera said the European company was attracting interest from countries in the region that want to reduce their reliance on non-European companies such as Elon Musk's Starlink.

""Our service is applicable to battlefield logistics, so we have been contacted for that technology,"" said Marco Guadalupi, Sateliot's co-founder and chief technology officer, without disclosing which countries or how many.

The company has signed an exclusivity agreement with defence contractor Indra (IDR.MC) , opens new tab , which owns a 4% in Sateliot, to sell its services to the military.

Aside from the defence sector, other potential customers include logistics companies, farmers, oil platforms, or environmental applications, which do not need real time broadband connections.

The company intends to start commercial service within two months by supplying local mobile telephone operators across the world. Final customers would pay about 2.50 euros ($2.83) a month to connect a device for a few moments a day.

The company intends to deploy about 100 satellites by 2028 and hit 1 billion euros in revenue by 2030. It will gradually improve the quality of connection, making it possible to transmit voice messages once its constellation gets denser.

After the most recent financing round, the Spanish state owns a 20% stake in Sateliot, Sanpera said.

Sateliot currently operates five low-orbit nano satellites, each about the size of a microwave oven, and services 12 test clients.

Indonesia to cut secondary reserve requirement for banks to 4%,"The Indonesian central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), is considering a reduction in the secondary reserve requirement for banks from 5% to 4%, effective from June.

This policy adjustment is set to free up Rp78.45tn ($4.84bn) in additional liquidity for the banking sector, reported Reuters.

The statement was made by Solikin M. Juhro, BI's head of macroprudential policy, during a press conference.

The decision to cut the reserve requirement comes after the central bank's third-interest rate reduction since September.

BI is also raising the limit on foreign funding for local banks to 35% of their capital, up from 30% to enhance liquidity and loan growth.

This move was confirmed by BI last week and that it would adjust the sharia Profit and Loss Sharing (PLM) by 100 basis points from 3.5% to 2.5% for sharia commercial banks, with repo flexibility of 2.5%, to be implemented from 1st June 2025.

The central bank has also reiterated its strategy to stabilising the rupiah through interventions in both offshore and domestic foreign exchange markets, and by purchasing government securities in the secondary market.

Furthermore, the bank also emphasised its strategies for term-repo and forex swap transactions to secure liquidity in the money market and banking industry.

It was confirmed to reduce the BI-Rate to 5.50% and deposit facility (DF) rate to 4.75% and the lending facility (LF) rate to 6.25%, all by 25bps.

"Elon Musk says he's back to sleeping at work, and Tesla investors are thrilled","This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The move: Tesla CEO Elon Musk is all about working at his companies again after his stint in government, and it's music to investors' ears.

Tesla shares are up 7% since last Friday, trading at about $362 a share. The stock, which plunged nearly 50% from its late-2024 peak earlier this year, is up 65% from its April low.

Why: Musk reaffirmed his commitment to his companies in a post on X over the weekend.

""Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,"" Musk said in a post on his social media platform. ""I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.""

What it means: The comments have bolstered investors' confidence in Tesla. Shareholders have raised concerns about Musk not spending enough time working at his car company in recent years, particularly after he took up a role in the DOGE office.

But sentiment has improved since Musk promised to step back from his gig in the White House starting in May.

Musk has been known to sleep in the office and has preached the virtues of working long hours in person over remote work.

In 2022, he spoke about sleeping on Tesla's factory floors when appearing at an investment conference in New York. After acquiring Twitter, which he later rebranded as X, Musk said he occasionally slept on the couches in Twitter's San Francisco HQ, and even turned some office spaces into bedrooms for workers.

Musk's reengagement with his company is coming at a critical time for Tesla. The stock nosedived more than 50% from its highs late last year through early April, thanks to declining sales, concerns about the impact of tariffs, and investor dissatisfaction with how much time Musk was spending away from the company.

The EV maker is getting ready to launch its robotaxi business this summer, and Wall Street is anticipating Tesla to soon roll out a more affordable vehicle, which Musk has teased for years.",https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-price-tsla-elon-musk-sleeping-at-work-rally-2025-5,Business
"USD edges lower on softer bonds, stocks – Scotiabank","The US Dollar (USD) is trading lower overall on the day, after easing back from its overnight peaks against the major currencies as global stocks and bonds slip, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes.

Bearish sentiment moderates but trend lower is intact

""A weak 40Y JGB auction appears to have weighed on bond market sentiment and stock markets are awaiting Nvidia results amid concerns about chip sector volatility. Month-end may still be a factor in short-term FX price moves. Earlier in the week, it had seemed as if some of the USD-negative headwinds were moderating; Treasurys had steadied and markets were perhaps coming round to the idea that President Trump’s tariff bark might be worse than its ultimate bite. But underlying fiscal worries remain as the president’s tax bill works its way through Congress.""

""Risk reversal pricing suggests some moderation in deeply bearish USD sentiment seen earlier this month but (BBDXY) riskies still reflect a solid skew in favour of dollar puts. Technical signals are supportive of some short-term stabilization in the USD but the broader bear trend in the USD (DXY) remains deeply entrenched across the short-, medium-, and long-term studies, suggesting that upside potential for the dollar generally remains quite limited. Overnight gains peaked around 99.87, effectively the lower end of the resistance zone (99.85/100.15) we highlighted yesterday. The RBNZ is the top performer on the session after the RBNZ cut rates to 3.25%, as expected.""

""But policymakers were split on the decision (1 dissenting vote) and the central bank signaled that policy was near neutral. Further rate cuts are likely but may be slower to emerge. Today sees the release of the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index for May (forecast down but less negative than April’s –13), the auction of USD70bn in 5Y notes and the 7th May FOMC meeting minutes (likely reaffirming the cautious outlook for policy while tariff uncertainty persists). There are comments from BoE economist Pill and the Banxico releases its inflation report at 14.30ET.

OGRA approves gas price adjustments across Pakistan,"The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has given approval for gas price adjustments for several areas in Pakistan, including Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Islamabad, ARY News reported.



The decision is applicable for both Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), with varying changes in pricing.

According to reports, a reduction in gas prices has been recommended for Sindh and Balochistan by OGRA. While an increase in price has been suggested for Punjab, KPK, and Islamabad.

Specifically, a decrease of Rs 103.95 per MMBTU will be seen by Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), whereas Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) will face a surge of Rs 116.90 per MMBTU.

The rising import costs of RLNG (Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas) are linked to the price increase in SNGPL.

OGRA has suggested that the federal government monitor gas management policies and set pricing adjustments, category-wise, to respond to financial shortfalls for the fiscal year 2025-26.

These gas price adjustments will finally be implemented, depending upon how soon the government approves, after which OGRA will issue an official notification.

The adjustments focus on sustaining financial necessities, with SNGPL requiring Rs527.55 billion and SSGC needing Rs319.78 billion to balance operations.

According to industry experts, these changes could remarkably impact both domestic and industrial consumers, mainly in regions facing price hikes.

The decision of the government on protected consumer categories will decide whether lower-income households will suffer the effects of these adjustments or if the burden will be shifted to high-end consumers.

The new gas price adjustments are likely to take effect from January 1, 2025. The decision is still pending in this regard.

Saudi's refining boom helps it weather oil price war,"Summary

Companies Saudi refining rises to seasonal all-time high in March

While kingdom's crude oil exports decline

Strong refining profits can offset revenue loss from weak crude prices

LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has been cranking up oil refining operations to capture strong profit margins, helping the kingdom offset revenue lost from declining crude prices and exports.

The world's top oil exporter has in recent years invested heavily in expanding and modernizing its refining and petrochemical capacity at home and overseas to meet growing demand for fuel and plastics while also securing outlets for its crude oil.

Sign up here.

Saudi Arabia has nine local refineries with a combined capacity of 3.33 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), accounting for roughly 3% of global demand, which are configured to process its domestically produced crude oil. It operates another 4.3 million bpd of refining capacity abroad, including in China, the United States and Malaysia.

The kingdom's domestic refineries processed 2.94 million bpd in March, the highest-ever volume for that month and only a smidgen below the record high of 2.96 million bpd in April 2024, according to data from the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI).

The 12% monthly increase in refining crude intake in March was 23% above the 10-year average for the same period. It correlates with a 12% month-on-month drop in Saudi crude exports to 5.75 million bpd in March, according to the data, highlighting the kingdom's flexibility between directly selling crude to other refiners and refining it itself.

Saudi refinery rates likely declined by around 200,000 bpd in April due to planned plant maintenance, but should remain at elevated levels ahead of peak summer demand season, according to Keshav Lohiya, CEO and founder of analytics firm Oilytics.

Saudi's refined product exports, which include diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and fuel oil, rose to a record 1.58 million bpd in March, before declining to 1.48 million bpd in April and 1.42 million bpd so far in May, according to data from ship tracking firm Kpler, likely reflecting refinery turnaround.

Saudi Arabia's refinery intake and crude exports

FLEXIBILITY

This integrated strategy offers Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) , opens new tab , the country's national oil company, an effective way to manage oil price volatility as refining margins - the profit made by processing crude oil into transportation fuels and chemicals - typically rise when feedstock prices decline.

It will likely prove valuable going forward after OPEC+, an alliance of major producing countries unofficially led by Riyadh and including Russia, started to rapidly unwind 2.2 million bpd of output since April.

The move to add a large volume of oil into an already well-supplied market concerned by the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on global economic activity put heavy pressure on oil prices, which dropped to around $65 a barrel from a high of $82 in mid-January.

Saudi Arabia and its allies will likely deepen the price war when they meet later this month by further accelerating the unwinding of their production cuts.

Refining margins have held strong so far this year despite the growing economic headwinds, benefiting from lower crude prices and healthy demand for diesel in particular. Benchmark Singapore refining margins are currently near their highest since February 2024 of around $8 a barrel, according to LSEG data.

Regardless of the possible impact of the trade wars, global fuel demand in the northern hemisphere typically peaks from June through early September, as motorists drive more over the summer while more air travel buoys jet fuel demand. This will therefore likely support refining margins in the coming months.

Saudi Aramco placed 28% of its crude oil production in domestic refining operations in 2024, up from 26% the previous year, according to its annual report. It also supplied 53% of the crude used by its joint venture refineries abroad.

The International Monetary Fund assessed that Saudi Arabia will need an average Brent oil price of around $90 a barrel in order to balance its national budget.

While crude prices are likely to remain at current levels or even lower for most of the year given the surge in supplies and demand uncertainty, the increased refining operations offer Riyadh an effective tool to manage oil price volatility and to better withstand a protracted price war.

Exports reached a record high in March 2025

Why Europe is pivoting back to nuclear — one of its most divisive energy sources,"A European-wide shift to nuclear power appears to be gathering momentum as countries hedge their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.

In just the last few weeks, Denmark announced plans to reconsider a 40-year ban on nuclear power as part of a major policy shift, Spain reportedly signaled an openness to review a shutdown of its nuclear plants and Germany dropped its long-held opposition to atomic power.

The renewed European interest in nuclear shows how some countries are hedging their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.

The burgeoning trend appears to be driven, at least in part, by some of the costs associated with renewables, notably solar and wind technologies.

""Solar and wind are still the cheapest and fastest way to drive the green transition, and that remains our focus. But we also need to understand whether new nuclear technologies can play a supporting role,"" Lars Aagaard, Denmark's minister for climate, energy and utilities, told CNBC via email.

The renewables-heavy Scandinavian country said in mid-May that it plans to analyze the potential benefits and risks of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind technologies.

Denmark's government, which banned the use of atomic energy in 1985, added that it does not plan a return to traditional nuclear power plants.

""We have no recent experience with nuclear power, and we lack the necessary knowledge regarding safety and waste management. That's why we must begin a serious analysis — not to replace solar and wind, but to see whether new nuclear can complement our energy system in the future,"" Aagaard said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/europe-pivots-back-to-nuclear-in-pursuit-of-more-energy-independence.html,Business
Low fertility is a big problem - with an easy solution,"By Alicia H. Munnell

Giving money to new parents won't fix the issue

In recent weeks, the government released provisional data for 2024 that show the birthrate remains low in the U.S., and reports suggest that the Trump administration wants to encourage Americans to get married and have more babies.

First the facts. Fertility rates have generally been falling since the end of the baby boom in the mid-1960s, and that decline accelerated after the Great Recession. Many observers thought that once the economy recovered, the fertility rate would rebound. It has not (see Figure 1). Today, the hypothetical lifetime number of births for a woman over her childbearing years is 1.63, well below the level required to hold the population steady.

The current fertility rate in the U.S. is not an anomaly; it is roughly in line with the rates in other high-income countries (see Figure 2). Part of the belated convergence reflects a dramatic decline in births among Hispanic women, some of which can be attributed to an increase in the native-born share of Hispanics and some may reflect the declining birthrate in originating countries such as Mexico. The important point is that we should not expect the U.S. rate to rebound in the foreseeable future. (For a great summary of the state of play on the fertility rate see a recent paper for the Aspen Institute by Melissa Kearney and Phil Levine.)

Is low fertility a problem? Some people think it's a positive reflection of women's ability to control their own destiny. Indeed, women have gained enormous ground in educational attainment and workplace opportunities.

Read: A new 'senior bonus' could give older adults a $4,000 tax break. Here's who would qualify.

However, low fertility does have real economic consequences as well. It can lead to less innovation and slower economic growth. It can also create fiscal problems. And for those of us interested in retirement, a major concern is the impact of low fertility on Social Security and Medicare, both of which fund benefits to retirees through taxes on workers. Although the Social Security Trustees have reduced long-run fertility assumptions somewhat, they still remain significantly above current rates (see Figure 3).

What can be done? Rumor has it that fertility issues will become ""a prominent piece"" of the administration's agenda. President Trump has called for a ""baby boom,"" and J.D. Vance, as well as Elon Musk, are clear pro-natalists. Some of the ideas in the mix for increasing fertility include a $5,000 cash ""baby bonus"" to every (married, I presume) American mother; reserving a portion of Fulbright scholarships for applicants who are married or have children; or educating women on their menstrual cycles so they know when they are ovulating and can conceive.

Read: The GOP tax bill would give every American newborn a $1,000 'MAGA account.' How would it work - and would it make a difference?

The challenge is that, over the last 30 years, many countries have instituted pronatalist policies - basing benefits on number of children, providing allowances for newborns, or offering child tax credits. The evidence suggests that these efforts haven't worked. Sweden is a wonderful example, because even with soup-to-nuts support its fertility rate is 1.67, virtually the same as that for the U.S.

Read: Opinion: I'm a millennial mom. Why are world leaders looking at me to fix the birth-rate problem?

So, what's the answer?

Tell Vance and Musk that $5,000 will do nothing, but also tell them that producing our own babies is not the only alternative. Increasing immigration is a direct way to raise the worker-to-retiree ratio and improve the finances of Social Security and Medicare. Sensitivity analysis by the Social Security actuaries shows that increasing net immigration by 200,000 per year would reduce the 75-year actuarial deficit, which is currently 3.5% of taxable payrolls, by roughly 0.2% of payrolls. That is, an increase in immigration can offset much of the cost pressure created by low fertility rates.

Thames Water fined £122.7m in biggest ever penalty,"Thames Water fined £122.7m in biggest ever penalty

Thames Water has been fined £122.7m for breaching rules over sewage spills and shareholder payouts. The penalty is the biggest ever issued by the water industry regulator Ofwat, which said the company had ""let down its customers and failed to protect the environment"". The watchdog confirmed the fines would be paid by the company and its investors, and not by customers who were hit with water bill increases last month. Thames Water said the company took its ""responsibility towards the environment very seriously"", and added it was continuing its search for new investment as it struggles under a £20bn debt pile.

The penalties come as Thames continues to face heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks. The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. It has been almost two years since the dire state of the company finances emerged, but Thames managed to secure a £3bn rescue loan earlier this year to stave off collapse. On Wednesday, Ofwat ordered Thames Water to pay a fine following two investigations into its operations. A penalty totalling £104.5m has been issued for breaches of rules connected to Thames's sewage operations.

Releasing raw sewage has the potential to significantly damage the environment and poses a risk to human health for those swimming in a river or sea where sewage is being discharged. Water companies are allowed to release untreated sewage into rivers and seas - storm overflows - when it rains heavily, to prevent homes being flooded. But Ofwat said its findings suggested three quarters of Thames Water's storm overflows were spilling ""routinely and not in exceptional circumstances"". It also fined Thames an additional £18.2m for breaches relating to shareholder payouts - known as dividends. One such payment worth £37.5m made in October 2023 to the firm's holding company and another £131.3m dividend made in March 2024, were found to have broken the rules. The regulator said the shareholder payouts were ""undeserved"" and did ""not properly reflect the company's delivery performance"". It is the first time the regulator has fined a water company for this reason. The scrutiny of dividends also adds to long-running criticism that Thames paid out billions in dividends over years instead of investing more cash in water infrastructure.

David Black, the chief executive of Ofwat, said the latest fines were a result of a ""clear-cut case where Thames Water has let down its customers and failed to protect the environment"". ""Our investigation has uncovered a series of failures by the company to build, maintain and operate adequate infrastructure to meet its obligations,"" he added. ""The company also failed to come up with an acceptable redress package that would have benefited the environment."" Thames Water is currently in ""cash lock up"" and no further dividend payments can be paid without approval from Ofwat. The company had expected to run out of cash completely by mid-April before it secured a rescue loan, and the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration. Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households would continue as normal. Ofwat said the penalties ""will be paid by the company and its investors, and not by customers"". The money from the fines will ultimately go to the Treasury, but no firm decision has been made about what it will be used for. The regulator said the March 2024 payout was funded through a tax break and that it will now make the company pay the tax to ""claw back the value"" of it. In April, water bills for households in England and Wales rose by £10 per month on average, although costs vary depending on suppliers - Thames customer bills have gone up from £488 to £639 a year. Ofwat proposed the £104m fine in August last year, but confirmed the penalty, and the additional £18.2m fine on Wednesday.

Environment Secretary Steve Reed said the ""era of profiting from failure is over"". Earlier this month, Thames Water's boss Chris Weston told MPs the company's survival depended on Ofwat being lenient over fines and penalties. Last week, the company decided to ""pause"" its scheme to pay out big bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its £3bn rescue loan. The decision comes after Downing Street said bosses at the troubled firm ""rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable"". A spokesperson for Thames Water said: ""We take our responsibility towards the environment very seriously and note that Ofwat acknowledges we have already made progress to address issues raised in the investigation relating to storm overflows. ""The dividends were declared following a consideration of the company's legal and regulatory obligations."" The company said its bid to raise more investment was continuing. Thames is in discussions with private investment group KKR about a cash injection of up to £5bn. But that deal being completed is also dependent on lenders to the company accepting a discount on the nearly £20bn they are owed. Some junior lenders could see their entire loan being written off.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgeg5vy9q8eo,Business

Thousands to get payouts over forced prepayment meter fitting,"Thousands to get payouts over forced prepayment meter fitting

5 hours ago Share Save Lucy Hooker and Faarea Masud Business reporters, BBC News Share Save

Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts of up to £1,000 each, and could see debts written off, in response to the scandal over the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are paying out more than £70m in compensation and financial support to customers. It follows a review by the regulator, Ofgem, of the way suppliers switched often vulnerable customers to paying upfront, without their agreement, after they fell behind with their bills. Energy UK, representing energy firms, said suppliers had worked hard to ""put things right"", following the intervention by Ofgem.

Eligible customers could receive payments starting at £40, rising to £250 or £500, depending on the way they were treated by their energy supplier, or where processes were not followed adequately. The £1,000 payments were for customers who had faced ""inappropriate installation"", Ofgem said. Some may already have received help, or have been contacted by their energy supplier. If not, customers did not need to take any action, Ofgem said, as compensation would be paid directly into customer accounts. ""Our priority has been to put things right for those who weren't treated properly, and ensure we don't see bad practice repeated,"" said Tim Jarvis, Ofgem's director general of markets. The scandal erupted two years ago, at the peak of the cost of living crisis, with energy prices spiking after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It emerged that energy firms were switching people who were struggling to pay their bills onto prepayment methods, either by remotely changing their smart meter to prepay mode, or by entering the property to install a new meter. There was a particular outcry when agents for British Gas were found to have forced their way into the homes of vulnerable people.

'Maybe I'll get some money back'

Aaron King, 54, from Kent, is one of those who say their energy company forcefully entered their home to fit a meter. He had lost his job and said he was really suffering, which he said resulted in him being £160 in debt for gas and electric. ""They [the energy company] had gone in and fitted prepayment meters, taking police and locksmiths with them. ""They also charged me for the police and locksmiths being there - over £400,"" he said. ""Maybe I will now get some money back"".

'Incorrect bills'

Jennifer Hicks, 72, from Langley in Berkshire said she had a forced meter change while she was out shopping about 18 months ago. ""I had no notice of it and was surprised things were moved in my home and not moved back,"" she said. Meanwhile, Christine Harries, 36, from Norwich said she was forced onto a prepayment meter and told to pay back £44 a month to her energy company for her debt but that the firm refused to send her an itemised bill showing what she owed. She said that before the meter was installed she was ""sent miscalculated bills for years - some for over £8,000 when I'd only lived here a few months"". She added that though she does have a small debt with her energy firm she has ""no idea"" if the debt the company is claiming she owes is correct.

'Fell short of standards'

Ofgem responded to the backlash from forced installations by suspending them and launching a review of the practice from January 2022 to January 2023. That review has found that suppliers ""fell short of required standards"" in the way they had treated customers. However, the nearly £74m Ofgem announced was being dispersed applies only to customers at eight suppliers: Scottish Power

EDF

E.ON

Octopus

Utility Warehouse

Good Energy

Tru Energy

Ecotricity Octopus inherited force fitting cases from Bulb and Shell when they acquired their customers. The eight firms have already disbursed £55m in financial support, Ofgem said. Another £5.6m would be paid in compensation to 40,000 affected customers. A further £13m would be used to write off debt for customers who had had a forced meter installation. Enforcement investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita and Ovo, representing tens of thousands more customers.

A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions that companies must meet if they want to install prepayment meters without customer consent. Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents energy firms, said suppliers had been working closely with Ofgem to meet the regulator's requirements, but said there were instances where forced fittings were appropriate. ""Involuntary installations have been a last – but necessary – resort for cases where repeated attempts to address debt with the customer through other means have been unsuccessful,"" she said. ""It's bad for customers to fall further and further into arrears, and bad debt ultimately drives up the prices that is paid by all customers,"" she added. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of the charity, Citizens Advice, said she would like to see the sector work quickly to disburse compensation to the worst affected. ""While it's right that those rules have been tightened, it's also vital that consumers get compensation for the distress that was caused,"" she said.

Energy secretary Ed Miliband called the forcible installation of pre-payment meters a ""scandal"", adding he was pleased to see the amount of compensation given by energy firms increased to £18.6m. He said the government's review of Ofgem would help reform the energy market to ""stamp out bad practice"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c308vzqj975o,Business
Tesco shoppers mock 'VAR'-style cameras at self-checkout,"Tesco shoppers mock 'VAR'-style cameras at self-checkout

Tesco's introduction of AI technology to some self-checkouts has led to customers joking that it bears a striking resemblance to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology used in football. The supermarket is aiming to reduce shoplifting by installing overhead cameras to identify when shoppers fail to scan an item properly, and then showing a live-action replay of the item not scanning. While some shoppers mocked the tech, others complained it was a step too far, with some saying they would not use self-checkout again. The move comes after shoplifting in the UK hit a record high in 2024.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales rose 20% last year to 516,971. But the number of thefts recorded by retailers themselves is even higher. Figures from the British Retail Consortium suggest there were 20.4 million thefts in the year to last September, up 3.7 million on the year before, costing retailers £2bn.

'The last item wasn't scanned properly'

""We have recently installed a new system at some stores which helps customers using self-service checkouts identify if an item has not been scanned properly, making the checkout process quicker and easier,"" a Tesco spokesperson said. The supermarket did not say which stores or how many stores the new system was in. If an item fails to scan, customers are shown a video on the self-service screen of their attempt, accompanied by a message saying: ""The last item wasn't scanned properly. Remove from bagging area and try again."" It follows a similar move by Sainsbury's, which has rolled out AI recognition technology at self-service checkouts at some of its stores. ""We regularly review the security measures in our stores and our decisions to implement them are based on a range of factors, including offering our customers a smooth checkout experience,"" said a Sainsbury's spokesperson.

""VAR Decision – Tuna Disallowed,"" joked one commenter on a video posted on Instagram showing the technology flagging an item that had failed to scan properly, which has had more than 3.5 million views. ""Clearly off side,"" added another. But on Bluesky, a user voiced fears that the technology could open the door to more surveillance measures. ""What's next? Drones to follow… you about the store?"" On Facebook, another user said he would ""not use self-checkouts"" after the technology was introduced.

One Tesco worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC they were grateful for the addition of the new tech. ""I work on self-service for Tesco and feel like I double up as a security guard,"" they said. ""You're not paid very well anyway and then you have tills to look after. ""I quite often have to monitor 10 self-checkouts, on my own, whilst two staff cover manual checkouts,"" they said, adding that there were many customers who steal and try to ""con the system"".

'Deeply invasive'

John O'Reilly John O'Reilly is concerned about how much the tech will track customer, and even employee, behaviour

Gaming developer John O'Reilly, 28, noticed the systems in their local Tesco in Woolwich in south-east London, and wonders how anyone can consent to ""such deeply invasive technology"". John says that everyone needs groceries so the number of people whose shopping can be tracked is huge. ""Are there even any rules informing customers before they enter? How on earth can the average person understand the extent of the tracking? ""Are children even kept out of the dataset? Who can access this data? Is it shared with police? Is my data being sold? We need answers to these questions!""

Heather, 30, from Nottingham says the tech makes her feel uncomfortable and punishes shoppers who are honest and use the self-scan as intended. ""Yes, you have cameras following you everywhere in the store, but this is simply too invasive,"" she told the BBC. ""If stores are so paranoid about shoppers stealing goods, then they should go back to staffed tills instead of wasting money on this invasive technology.""

A Delta flight erupted into chaos on Saturday when two pigeons were discovered in the plane's main cabin, video of the pandemonium shows.

According to an Instagram post from another passenger, Tom Caw was the passenger who spotted the first pigeon before the plane departed from Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. Caw said the pilot announced the pigeon sighting and returned the plane to the gate to have the bird removed.

As the flight taxied out to take off again, a second pigeon emerged and flew down the main aisle of the cabin, video Caw posted on Instagram and NBC News obtained shows. The bird prompted several passengers to scream.

""Pilot said when he radioed the control tower about us coming back due to a pigeon, the guy said that was a first for him,"" Caw wrote. ""Pilot told him it was the second time for him—the first being half an hour earlier.""

Delta issued a statement apologizing for the disruption to the flight, which was headed for Madison, Wisconsin.

""Delta appreciates the careful actions of our people and our customers to safely remove two birds from the aircraft prior to departure, and we apologize to our customers for the delay in their travel,"" the company said in a statement.

Caw said a baggage handler removed the second bird.

Why a new zero-carbon UK steel plant offers hope and a headache,"The ironworks in Saudi Arabia’s coastal city of Dammam has had an unusual journey: it has crossed the Atlantic Ocean – twice. It was moved to Saudi Arabia in 2006 from Alabama, US. Before that, the plant’s home was in the UK.

The plant can produce about 1m tonnes a year of direct reduced iron (DRI), a material that can be used in green steel production. Decades after the plant left the UK – shipped in 28,000 pieces – British ministers are now considering reversing course and funding a similar facility once again.

However, the government’s DRI ambition is controversial within the British steel sector; the lobby group UK Steel told the Guardian that a DRI plant was not its priority. Senior industry insiders said they were concerned that hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer money may be spent on funding a “white elephant”.

The government last month recalled parliament to pass emergency legislation to take control of British Steel’s two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, amid concerns its Chinese owner, Jingye, was days away from closing it. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and the industry minister Sarah Jones said the effective takeover was necessary to preserve the UK’s ability to produce “virgin” or primary steel from iron ore.

The Scunthorpe blast furnaces, known as Queen Anne and Queen Bess, are the last two operating in the UK. However, despite receiving materials supplies for several months, they are running out of time, and ministers are hoping to find a way of retaining primary steelmaking abilities.

Blast furnaces use the carbon in coal to strip oxygen from iron ore. That process eventually results in carbon dioxide being vented into the atmosphere, where it heats the globe. Many steel companies are switching to much cleaner electric arc furnaces, which use electricity to melt down scrap steel. However, they cannot produce iron from iron ore.

That is where DRI could come in. The process strips out the ore’s oxygen using gas. While the vast majority of DRI uses methane, resulting in carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere, switching to using green hydrogen could allow iron production without significant emissions.

Ministers have repeatedly cited DRI as a strong contender to receive part of a £2.5bn fund for a new steel strategy. Reynolds last month told parliament: “Direct reduced iron technology is of significant potential interest to us for the future.”

Yet, within the industry the idea is seen as a lower priority than reducing energy costs and preventing a flood of metal imports diverted to avoid Donald Trump’s tariffs, according to the lobby group UK Steel and several industry executives.

Several executives and industry experts have raised significant doubts over whether a new UK DRI plant, costing up to £2bn to build, would provide good value for money.

The owners of the two biggest steelworks, Tata Steel at Port Talbot, Wales, and British Steel at Scunthorpe, are not thought to be interested in sourcing the huge DRI supplies that would justify a plant. Other, smaller producers such as Celsa in Cardiff and Liberty Steel at Rotherham could use DRI, but do not need to.

Energy costs

UK Steel said it would be better to focus on reducing sky-high energy costs at existing plants to match rates in France and Germany than on subsidising an expensive new facility. As the Saudi plant’s trajectory shows, DRI plants have tended, like much heavy industry, to cluster in countries with abundant, cheap energy. The UK has some of the highest industrial energy prices in the world.

“The UK steel industry is in crisis, facing uncompetitive market conditions, shrinking demand, and global trade pressures,” UK Steel said.

“While the steel strategy is an opportunity to formulate a long-term vision for the sector, the government must also assess how its finite resources are best allocated at this point in time. Addressing urgent issues like electricity prices and trade defence must clearly take priority in order to put our sector on a sustainable footing.”

The trade body said that efforts to assess how to meet future demand for steel would include assessing the need for – and viability of – a UK DRI plant, adding: “Energy costs and access to affordable hydrogen will underpin this assessment, balanced against investing in new capabilities, energy efficiency, and productivity improvements.”

UK Steel said there would be an “opportunity cost” to spending on DRI, while still remaining reliant on imports for iron ore.

The government’s steel council, which brings together ministers, unions and businesses, discussed DRI in detail during the British Steel crisis, to the frustration of some in industry.

“It’ll just become a white elephant,” one senior figure in the industry said. New DRI plants usually only employ about 200 people.

Crisis backup

However, union leaders and many MPs believe that virgin steel is crucial either for making weapons in case of war, or for economic resilience in crises such as pandemics. Saudi Arabia is the only member of the G20 group of developed economies that does not have blast furnaces to make iron for steel production. But its two DRI plants mean it could theoretically, at a pinch, keep producing iron and therefore steel.

Alasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary at Community, a union representing UK steelworkers, said there was a strong case for DRI investment.

“Investment in DRI can make our steel greener and more competitive, while maintaining the UK’s primary steelmaking capability, which is so crucial in our volatile world,” he said.

“DRI is fully compatible with electric arc furnaces and would make them more sustainable by delivering a secure, homegrown supply of metallics, and allowing for the future adoption of hydrogen-based steelmaking.”

The UK government is awaiting a report on DRI by the Materials Processing Institute, a Middlesbrough-based research organisation, which is expected to recommend DRI as necessary to maintain primary steelmaking. Ministers will have to weigh up whether to heavily subsidise a plant to attract a private sector investor.

“People see it as a bit of a red herring,” one industry leader said. “Stop going on about this DRI stuff. If you’ve got limited resources, you would probably do something else.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/28/zero-carbon-uk-steel-plant-dri-green,Business
Starling’s profits drop 25% as bank takes blame for Covid loan losses,"The digital bank Starling has suffered a 25% drop in annual profits and said it would turn down government guarantees on £28m of Covid loans losses after conceding its own weak controls were to blame.

The admission stirs up a long-running controversy over Starling’s handling of the government-backed bounce back loan (BBL) scheme, which was built to get money quickly to small businesses during lockdown.

The scheme offered loans of up to £50,000 at 2.5% interest but carried little risk, with taxpayers picking up 100% of losses if the companies defaulted.

On Wednesday, Starling’s chief executive, Raman Bhatia, said the bank had proactively reviewed some of the BBLs on its books, and conceded that a tranche of loans had been granted to applicants without proper checks. That meant they were unlikely to qualify for government guarantees, which might have otherwise seen taxpayers foot the £28m bill.

“In some cases, we think we may not have met all the procedures, all the requirements, of the scheme,” Bhatia told journalists during the conference call. He did not confirm whether Starling had discovered fraud or financial crime within that tranche of loans.

The news comes just months after Starling was hit with a £29m fine for “shockingly lax” financial crime controls, which the City regulator said had left the financial system “wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions”.

Together, the fine and BBL loss reduced Starling’s profit for the year to March to £223m, down 25% from £301m a year earlier.

Bhatia said the bank may consider cutting or clawing back pay from executives if appropriate. “We have discharged our duties to consider any impact on [remuneration] where appropriate. I can’t share any further details.”

It is not clear whether that might impact Starling’s founder and former chief executive, Anne Boden, who stepped down in 2023 citing a “conflict of interest” between being a boss and a large shareholder in the lender.

Starling’s distribution of Covid loans gained heightened attention in 2022 when a former minister, Theodore Agnew, accused Starling of using the BBL scheme as a “cost-free marketing exercise to build their loan book and so their company valuation” and failing to properly review borrowers before handing out taxpayer-backed loans.

Boden at the time vehemently denied Agnew’s claims.

Unlike large lenders, Starling opened BBL applications to new clients and saw its client base swell as a result. Its business customer base grew from 87,000 to 330,000, equivalent to adding 15,000 a month. And while the bank had only issued £23m of its own loans before the pandemic in November 2019, it had distributed £1.6bn in BBLs by the time the scheme closed in March 2021.

Commenting on the Financial Conduct Authority fine and the BBL loss on Wednesday, Starling’s chief financial officer, Declan Ferguson, said: “We continue to make significant investment into our financial crime resource to ensure our risk management and compliance capabilities are commensurate with the high-growth business and experience.

“Working closely with both the FCA and the British business bank, we have also sought to limit the impact of these issues and ensure they remain one-offs, but now we are now more confident we are moving forward into the next stage of our growth on much stronger foundations.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/28/starling-profits-dip-25-percent-bank-takes-blame-covid-loan-losses,Business

The deal could provide xAI, which acquired X earlier this year in a deal that values the social media platform at $33 billion, with valuable data to train and develop its AI models.

With many open-source repositories exhausted, AI companies face increasing challenges in sourcing quality data, pushing firms like Meta Platforms to utilize public interactions with AI for model training.

According to its privacy policy, X uses public posts from users to train its AI models. It was not immediately clear if xAI would utilize data from Telegram similarly.

The companies did not respond to requests for comment.

XAI has signed several tie-ups this year to bolster its position in both AI infrastructure and financial services.

"7 million new jobs will evaporate this year because of trade war, UN predicts","London CNN —

The United Nations expects that millions of potential jobs will vanish this year because of an economic slowdown triggered by US President Donald Trump’s trade war.

The International Labour Organization (ILO), a UN agency, predicts in a report released Wednesday that 53 million jobs will be created worldwide in 2025 — 7 million fewer than previously thought — owing to a shakier economic outlook caused by trade disruptions and geopolitical tensions.

The agency based its analysis on the International Monetary Fund’s downgraded expectations for the global economy. In April, the IMF said global GDP would rise by 2.8% this year, down from a previous estimate of 3.2%, citing the uncertainty unleashed by Trump’s barrage of new tariffs on America’s trading partners.

The ILO, which promotes labor rights worldwide, also said that almost 84 million jobs across 71 countries “are directly or indirectly tied to US consumer demand” and thus vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Nearly 56 million of these at-risk roles are in the Asia-Pacific region, it added, with more than 13 million spanning Canada and Mexico.

“Workers tied to US consumption and investment demand… now face elevated risks of partial or total income loss due to higher tariffs and the unpredictability of future trade measures,” the agency said.

Since Trump re-took office in January, he has hiked import duties on America’s trading partners and on key goods, including cars and steel. The president has set July 9 as the date he plans to impose punishingly high “reciprocal tariffs” on other countries unless those nations are able to strike a trade deal with Washington.

The tariffs, their erratic implementation and the unpredictability both have injected into the global economy are weighing on many businesses and consumers. The ILO noted that employers may be “more cautious” about hiring new workers in such an uncertain landscape.

“We know that the global economy is growing at a slower pace than we had anticipated it would,” Gilbert Houngbo, the ILO’s director general, said in a statement. “If geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions continue… then they will most certainly have negative ripple effects on labor markets worldwide.”",https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/business/ilo-7-million-jobs-trade-war-intl,Business

Here's a timeline of the Singapore-headquarted company's attempts to go public and the various setbacks it has encountered.

Shein had moved its headquarters from China to Singapore in 2022, while its supply chains and warehouses largely remain in China.

JANUARY 2022

Shein revives plans to list in New York. Founder Chris Xu considers changing his citizenship to bypass proposed tougher rules for offshore IPOs in China, two sources told Reuters.

It had first started preparing for a U.S. IPO about two years prior to this but shelved the plan partly due to unpredictable markets amid rising U.S.-China tensions, sources told Reuters.

Shein puts its U.S. listing plans on hold due to volatile capital markets amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, sources say.

MAY 2024

Shein steps up preparations for a London listing after its attempt to float itself in New York faced regulatory hurdles and pushback from U.S. lawmakers, sources said.

Shein plans to update China's securities regulator on the change of the IPO venue and file with the LSE as soon as May 2024, said one of them.

Senior British lawmakers, including the chairs of three parliamentary committees, questioned Shein's suitability for a London stock market listing and called for greater scrutiny of the Chinese-founded firm.

GIA Investments is the holding company of one of the largest brokerage and agency groups in Poland, servicing approximately PLN410 million in premiums annually, with a focus on life insurance and assistance services.

The acquisition of 100% of shares of five companies owned by GIA Investments. GIA Investments is the holding company of one of the largest brokerage and agency groups in Poland, servicing approximately PLN410 million in premiums annually, with a focus on life insurance and assistance services.

The acquisition will strengthen the MJM Group’s position in the brokerage market. After consolidating results, the annual premium placed by the Group is expected to exceed PLN1.5 billion (projected value post-transaction). The transaction aligns with MJM Group’s growth strategy, supported by Corsair Capital. The acquisitions from GIA Investments will allow MJM Group to consolidate its position in the group life insurance and employee benefits sectors, bolster its in-house distribution network, and elevate its long-standing know-how in the brokerage and agency sectors.

This is the third transaction contributing to the development of the MJM Group and the fourth for Corsair Capital in the past 18 months all supported by DLA Piper. Previously, in November 2024, the firm advised MJM Holdings, among others, on establishing a strategic partnership with Leadenhall Insurance.

A team from DLA Piper's Warsaw office worked on the transaction led by Corporate partner Piotr Miller and senior associate Jakub Szczygieł, and associate Jakub Niemiec. The team also comprised of counsels Dominika Wolf, Beata Mrozowska-Bartkiewicz, Piotr Falarz, senior associate Emilia Kalecka, associates Natalia Cichocka-Stępień, Karol Kuterek, and junior associates Jakub Retyk, Franciszek Ignacy Fortuna, Natalia Potrubacz, and Aleksander Stanek.

Brazil utility Eletrobras taps BTG to sell Eletronuclear stake,"The logo of Brazil's power company Eletrobras is seen in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil January 3, 2019. REUTERS/Pilar Olivares/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab

SAO PAULO, May 28 (Reuters) - Brazilian electric company Eletrobras has tapped investment bank BTG Pactual (BPAC3.SA) , opens new tab to advise on the sale of its remaining stake in state-run nuclear power generator Eletronuclear, said three sources familiar with the deal.

Following its privatization in 2022, Eletrobras ceased to be the controlling owner of Eletronuclear but remained a minority partner with 36% of voting shares and 68% of the total capital.

Sign up here.

Eletrobras and BTG declined to comment.

The proposed sale is part of a broader agreement last month, boosting the government's representation on the Eletrobras board and allowing the utility to reduce its exposure to nuclear businesses.

Eletronuclear operates Brazil's two nuclear power plants, in Angra dos Reis in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with a total capacity of 1,990 megawatts. It is also responsible for the Angra 3 project, a new unit with 1,405 MW, which has stalled due to difficulties in getting government approval for its completion.

Eletronuclear has faced economic and financial challenges, as revenue from its plants has been insufficient to cover its high expenses. The national nuclear chain also suffers from the lack of long-term planning, specialists have said.

Nuclear energy is enjoying global growth as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels and a more reliable energy source than wind and solar power. Several markets, including the U.S. and Europe, are seeking to revive or launch nuclear projects to meet surging energy demand by artificial intelligence data centers.

"Drug warranties, outcome-based agreements, and barriers to costly therapies","Advanced gene, cell, and specialty therapies have the potential to transform patient lives. However, they come at a steep cost to patients, payers, and the healthcare system, with prices running into the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars. A relatively new concept known as a drug warranty is gaining traction as a means to offer some financial protection when these costly treatments are ineffective.

This is the second in a series of articles exploring the use of warranties in a pharmaceutical environment, designed to address drug manufacturers’ challenges, educate patients and end payers, and expand awareness about the value of warranty programs to the wider healthcare system.

Exploring other market access tools for advanced therapies

Therapeutic warranty solutions largely differ from other market access tools, such as value-based agreements (VBAs) and outcomes-based agreements (OBAs). While drug warranties establish agreements directly between manufacturers and end payers, VBAs and OBAs are typically made between manufacturers and intermediaries, such as administrative services organizations or pharmacy benefit managers. The intermediary — essentially a third-party administrator — works to negotiate the terms of the agreement between itself and the manufacturer. However, they typically do not assume financial responsibility for the treatment.

If a patient qualifies for reimbursement for a therapy that did not work as intended under the terms of a VBA or OBA, payment takes the form of a performance rebate, or a refund or discount provided by the manufacturer that should, in theory, go to the end payer. However, due to the involvement of intermediaries, the full value of the rebate often does not fully cascade down to the end payer, the entity that took on the true and total financial risk. Moreover, because the contract is typically between the manufacturer and the intermediary, the end payer may not even be aware that a rebate exists or even the terms of the VBA or OBA, should one exist.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers tend to strictly control rebate amounts and discounts, as these dollars are considered a concession to pricing and must be reported to the US government, where they are factored into the CMS best price calculation. This reality makes it even less likely that end payers will be fully reimbursed for the risk they are assuming — if at all.

Further, since these agreements are negotiated individually, with only a handful of intermediaries servicing a minority of end payers, many potential patients may not be able to easily access these expensive therapies because their payer has no recourse if the treatment is ineffective. Smaller and/or self-insured plans, particularly, may not have the ability to negotiate a rebate aligned with their risk tolerance, and ultimately decide not to cover the drug.

Drug warranties, on the other hand, are oriented directly between the manufacturer and end payer. As the payouts are not held against CMS best price (see box), pharmaceutical manufacturers are better able to provide payers with meaningful remuneration to the right counterparty. Rather than negotiating individual VBAs and OBAs with many parties, a warranty comes with all sales of the drug, which dramatically simplifies the negotiation process for the manufacturer. Once the drug receives regulatory approval and its label is known, the terms of the warranty can be clearly defined by the manufacturer.

The warranty accompanies every sale of the therapy, allowing all end payers to benefit from it, regardless of their bargaining power. By offering a warranty on their therapy, pharmaceutical manufacturers can increase the chances that payers, both large and small, may include the drug on their plans, in turn expanding access to more patients.",https://www.marsh.com/en/industries/life-sciences/insights/drug-warranties-outcomes-based-agreements-barriers.html,Business

"INTERVIEW: Thailand's rice exports buoyed by buyer trust despite market challenges, says TREA president","Thailand's rice exports are expected to reach 7.5 million mt in 2025, supported by early-year momentum and strong buyer trust, even as global market conditions remain weak and Indian competition intensifies, Charoen Laothammatas, President of the Thai Rice Exporters Association, told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an interview.

""In the first four months of 2025, we've already exported about 2.5 to 2.7 million mt, so we're confident that we'll hit our annual target,"" Laothammatas said.

The FAS USDA projects that Thailand will export 7 million mt in marketing year 2024-25, with an anticipated increase to 7.2 million mt in MY 2025-26. Large exportable supplies will boost shipments to traditional markets, including China and Iraq, according to the USDA's latest report released in May.

India's record harvest of around 147 million mt, coupled with subdued demand from large buyers like Indonesia, is weighing on the global rice market. ""India's aggressive pricing is impacting the entire market, making it more challenging for Thailand,"" he said.

Despite these difficulties, Thailand continues to enjoy a competitive edge rooted in its reputation for quality and reliability.

""Buyers are willing to pay a couple of dollars more for Thai rice because of our consistent quality and reliability,"" Laothammatas said, pointing to South African buyers' preference for Thai rice.

Thailand ships around 650,000 mt of Thai Hom Mali rice to the US each year, and although demand remains strong, rising tariff risks could allow Vietnam to gain a foothold. ""Vietnam exports around 30,000 mt to the US each year, and they could potentially replace Thai Hom Mali in the long term if a higher tariff is imposed by the US,"" he said.

The TREA continues to oppose government intervention in rice exports. ""Unlike some countries, we've never imposed an export ban on rice,"" he said, adding that Thailand believes in allowing free-market dynamics to drive the trade.

Short-term pressure on Thai rice prices is likely to persist, driven by India's surplus and price dumping. ""Here in Thailand, paddy prices have dropped below production costs, which is hurting farmers,"" Laothammatas said. He warned that some farmers may skip a growing season as a result.

Looking further ahead, Thailand's rice export industry faces broader challenges, including political instability and rigid export standards. ""Strict export standards may hinder growth,"" he said, pointing to the high purity requirements for Hom Mali and fragrant rice, which add to inspection and compliance costs.

Unlike other commodities, rice remains largely a spot market product, and long-term contracts are unlikely to become the norm, according to Laothammatas.

FUJAIRAH DATA: Oil product stocks extend slump across all categories,"Oil product inventories at the UAE's Port of Fujairah declined 13% in the week ended May 26, with all categories showing declines led by a 22% drop in middle distillates to a record low, according to Fujairah Oil Industry Zone data published May 28.

The total fell to 17.894 million barrels, a four-month low. Middle distillates such as jet fuel and diesel fell to 1.006 million barrels, the lowest since the port began sharing the data with Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in 2017.

Light distillates, including gasoline and naphtha, dropped 12% to 7.293 million barrels, a two-month low, while heavy distillates used as fuel oil for power generation and shipping fell 13% to 9.595 million barrels, the lowest in two weeks.

Gasoil and diesel shipments from Fujairah are averaging 114,000 b/d for May, the second consecutive month above 100,000 b/d, according to S&P Global Commodities at Sea cargo-tracking data. Mozambique, Djibouti, and Oman are the top destinations for this month.

France is the only destination for jet fuel shipments from Fujairah in May at 26,000 b/d, the first such shipment to France since May 2022, according to the cargo-tracking data.

Fuel oil exports from Fujairah are averaging 281,000 b/d in May, led by Singapore and South Korea, the data show. Iraq is also set to get fuel oil from Fujairah this month for the first time since January 2021.

Bunker demand stable to lukewarm

At the Fujairah hub, sellers were reportedly keen to draw down their high-sulfur fuel oil cargoes over the past week, stiffening competition among suppliers and posing significant downsides to delivered premiums.

Amid adequate HSFO cargo availabilities and largely healthy barging schedules for buyers' prompt requirements, suppliers around the neighboring Khor Fakkan hub have also been offering aggressively, keeping demand broadly supported.

The Platts-assessed Fujairah-delivered 380 CST HSFO bunker premium to the fuel oil 380 CST 3.5%S FOB Arab Gulf cargoes most recently tumbled to an over 16-month low of $6.44/mt on May 23, before a marginal rebound to $7.65/mt May 27. The premium was last lower at $6.23/mt on Jan. 23.

Fujairah's HSFO bunker premiums have averaged $15.86/mt so far in May, almost halving from $29.55/mt across April.

Suppliers of low-sulfur fuel oil were also mostly eager to sell outstanding inventories by the end of May, buoying overall selling activity in the segment. Recent offers were also for end-May through very early June refueling stems, with prompt barging availabilities mostly remaining healthy.

""It's heavily backwardated [on LSFO], so it's better to sell these off... HSFO might be tighter next month as the summer [season] steps up,"" a Fujairah-based bunker supplier said May 28.

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the Fujairah-delivered 0.5%S marine fuel bunker premium over the benchmark FOB Singapore Marine Fuel 0.5%S cargo value at an average of $6.46/mt over May 2-27, below $9.22/mt in April.",https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/052825-fujairah-data-oil-product-stocks-extend-slump-across-all-categories,Business

Summary

Companies Would buy UniCredit Russia at 60% discount to market value

UniCredit has been gradually reducing exposure

Rome asked UniCredit to leave Russia by early 2026

ROME, May 28 (Reuters) - Three companies based in the United Arab Emirates have approached the Italian Treasury with a proposal to buy the Russian operations of UniCredit (CRDI.MI) , opens new tab at a steep discount, a document seen by Reuters showed.

UniCredit is under pressure both from the European Central Bank and Italy's government to quit Russia, where it runs a commercial lender. It has so far resisted leaving at a loss, insisting instead on a gradual disengagement. This month it targeted ending its Russian retail business by mid-2026.

Sign up here.

Under the plan, Dubai-based investment firms Asas Capital and Mada Capital would set up a special purpose vehicle and team up with Inweasta, an advisory and investment firm which already operates in Russia, the document showed.

The Gulf-based investors are relatively small and little-known. Mada manages the equivalent of $639 million in assets and focuses on regional markets.

Asas Capital was founded in Dubai in 2009 and says it focuses on capital markets, private equity, advisory and entrepreneurship.

Unspecified Italian partners would also take part in the deal, with the task of securing approvals from the ECB, Italy and European Union and U.S. regulators.

""All parties involved in the transaction are not subject to sanctions and are in full compliance with the applicable sanctions regime,"" the document said.

""The source of funds originates from the United Arab Emirates,"" it added.

News of the proposal was first reported by Italian daily Il Messaggero. Asas, Mada and Inweasta did not immediately reply to requests for comment. UniCredit declined to comment.

Inweasta specialises among other things in cross-border disputes resolution. Last year it bought Czech group PPF's Russian PPF Life Insurance LLC business, securing approval from the central bank and the Foreign Investment Subcommittee.

""Inweasta facilitates obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals and transaction documentation in Russia,"" the document said.

A presidential decree and a green light from the Bank of Russia are necessary for Western companies to dispose of Russian assets.

The UAE consortium is proposing the acquisition of UniCredit's Russian business at a 60% discount to market value, the document showed.

UniCredit has been steadily reducing its Russian operations though it has challenged the stricter exit deadlines demanded by the European Central Bank through the European General Court.

The Italian government has also asked UniCredit to exit Russia by early 2026 as part of conditions to authorise its buyout offer for smaller domestic rival Banco BPM (BAMI.MI) , opens new tab

Critical minerals don’t belong in landfills – microwave tech offers a cleaner way to reclaim them from e-waste,"When the computer or phone you’re using right now blinks its last blink and you drop it off for recycling, do you know what happens?

At the recycling center, powerful magnets will pull out steel. Spinning drums will toss aluminum into bins. Copper wires will get neatly bundled up for resale. But as the conveyor belt keeps rolling, tiny specks of valuable, lesser-known materials such as gallium, indium and tantalum will be left behind.

Those tiny specks are critical materials. They’re essential for building new technology, and they’re in short supply in the U.S. They could be reused, but there’s a problem: Current recycling methods make recovering critical minerals from e-waste too costly or hazardous, so many recyclers simply skip them.

Sadly, most of these hard-to-recycle materials end up buried in landfills or get mixed into products like cement. But it doesn’t have to be this way. New technology is starting to make a difference.

Ansan Pokharel/West Virginia University , CC BY

As demand for these critical materials keeps growing, discarded electronics can become valuable resources. My colleagues and I at West Virginia University are developing a new technology to change how we recycle. Instead of using toxic chemicals, our approach uses electricity, making it safer, cleaner and more affordable to recover critical materials from electronics.

How much e-waste are we talking about?

Americans generated about 2.7 million tons of electronic waste in 2018, according to the latest federal data. Including uncounted electronics, a survey by the United Nations suggests that the U.S. recycles only about 15% of its total e-waste.

Even worse, nearly half the electronics that people in Northern America sent to recycling centers end up shipped overseas. They often land in scrapyards, where workers may use dangerous methods like burning or leaching using harsh chemicals to pull out valuable metals. These practices can harm both the environment and workers’ health. That’s why the Environmental Protection Agency restricts these methods in the U.S.

The tiny specks matter

Critical minerals are in most of the technology around you. Every phone screen has a super-thin layer of a material called indium tin oxide. LEDs glow because of a metal called gallium. Tantalum stores energy in tiny electronic parts called capacitors.

All of these materials are flagged as “high risk” on the U.S. Department of Energy’s critical materials list. That means the U.S. relies heavily on these materials for important technologies, but their supply could be easily disrupted by conflicts, trade disputes or shortages.

Right now, just a few countries, including China, control most of the mining, processing and recovery of these materials, making the U.S. vulnerable if those countries decide to limit exports or raise prices.

These materials aren’t cheap, either. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey reports that gallium was priced between US$220 to $500 per kilogram in 2024. That’s 50 times more expensive than common metals like copper, at $9.48 per kilogram in 2024.

Revolutionizing recycling with microwaves

At West Virginia University’s Department of Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering, I and materials scientist Edward Sabolsky asked a simple question: Could we find a way to heat only specific parts of electronic waste to recover these valuable materials?

If we could focus the heat on just the tiny specks of critical minerals, we might be able to recycle them easily and efficiently.

The solution we found: microwaves.

This equipment isn’t very different from the microwave ovens you use to heat food at home, just bigger and more powerful. The basic science is the same – electromagnetic waves cause electrons to oscillate, creating heat.

In our approach, though, we’re not heating water molecules like you do when cooking. Instead, we heat carbon, the black residue that collects around a candle flame or car tailpipe. Carbon heats up much faster in a microwave than water does. But don’t try this at home; your kitchen microwave wasn’t designed for such high temperatures.

Ansan Pokharel/West Virginia University , CC BY

In our recycling method, we first shred the electronic waste, mix it with materials called fluxes that trap impurities, and then heat the mixture with microwaves. The microwaves rapidly heat the carbon that comes from the plastics and adhesives in the e-waste. This causes the carbon to react with the tiny specks of critical materials. The result: a tiny piece of pure, sponge-like metal about the size of a grain of rice.

This metal can then be easily separated from leftover waste using filters.

So far, in our laboratory tests, we have successfully recovered about 80% of the gallium, indium and tantalum from e-waste, at purities between 95% and 97%. We have also demonstrated how it can be integrated with existing recycling processes.

Why the Department of Defense is interested

Our recycling technology got its start with help from a program funded by the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.

Many important technologies, from radar systems to nuclear reactors, depend on these special materials. While the Department of Defense uses less of them than the commercial market, they are a national security concern.

We’re planning to launch larger pilot projects next to test the method on smartphone circuit boards, LED lighting parts and server cards from data centers. These tests will help us fine-tune the design for a bigger system that can recycle tons of e-waste per hour instead of just a few pounds. That could mean producing up to 50 pounds of these critical minerals per hour from every ton of e-waste processed.

If the technology works as expected, we believe this approach could help meet the nation’s demand for critical materials.

How to make e-waste recycling common

One way e-waste recycling could become more common is if Congress held electronics companies responsible for recycling their products and recovering the critical materials inside. Closing loopholes that allow companies to ship e-waste overseas, instead of processing it safely in the U.S., could also help build a reserve of recovered critical minerals.

But the biggest change may come from simple economics. Once technology becomes available to recover these tiny but valuable specks of critical materials quickly and affordably, the U.S. can transform domestic recycling and take a big step toward solving its shortage of critical materials.",https://theconversation.com/critical-minerals-dont-belong-in-landfills-microwave-tech-offers-a-cleaner-way-to-reclaim-them-from-e-waste-254908,Business

Summary

Companies Restructuring includes commitment of $1.6 billion in financing

Deal also includes elimination of more than $2 billion of debt Further commitment of up to $950 million in equity financing

U.S.-listed shares of Azul down some 40% in premarket

May 28 (Reuters) - Shares of airline Azul (AZUL.N) , opens new tab plunged on Wednesday after the Brazilian company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, despite months of efforts to restructure mostly pandemic-era debt.

The filing, which may scupper a potential merger with peer Gol (GOLL4.SA) , opens new tab , makes the carrier the latest in a series of Latin American airlines to file for bankruptcy in the aftermath of the depression the industry suffered in the initial months of COVID-19.

Sign up here.

U.S-listed shares of Azul fell some 40% in premarket trade, making a 70% decrease in its stock year to date.

A restructuring deal includes a commitment of $1.6 billion in financing throughout the process, elimination of more than $2 billion of debt, and a further commitment of up to $950 million in equity financing upon emergence, the carrier said in a securities filing.

""We had too much debt on the balance sheet that principally came from COVID. We now have an opportunity to clean it all up,"" Chief Executive John Rodgerson told Reuters in an interview.

""We believe we could be in and out prior to the end of the year,"" Rodgerson said. ""The exit is sometimes the most difficult part of this process. So we're already entering with the exit in mind, and exiting with the financing lined up.""

EQUITY STAKE

Azul last year struck a deal with lessors to scrap $550 million in debt in exchange for an equity stake of around 20%, as well as one with bondholders to raise an additional $500 million.

But factors such as high costs, supply-chain issues delaying aircraft deliveries and maintenance plans, and a weaker Brazilian real , have kept the company under pressure.

""What I used to pay in interest in 2019 has gone up 10 times with a currency that is 50% weaker,"" Rodgerson said.

United and American agreed to invest up to $300 million to backstop an equity rights offering to repay the airline's debtor-in-possession financing when it emerges from bankruptcy.

Azul's net debt soared 50% year-on-year by the end of the first quarter to 31.35 billion reais ($5.6 billion), with its leverage ratio hitting 5.2, up from 3.7 a year earlier.

The latest blow came last month, as a capital increase fell short of expectations, further pressuring Azul's shares which have plunged nearly 70% so far this year.

Agencies such as Fitch and S&P recently downgraded Azul's credit ratings, with the latter citing an elevated default risk.

Azul said it would maintain its operations and sales normally while in Chapter 11.

The Chapter 11 filing likely spoils Azul's plans for a potential business combination with rival Gol, which would have created a dominant carrier in Latin America's No.1 economy that Rodgerson once touted as a ""national champion"".

Samsung Develops Next-Generation Peltier Cooling Technology With Johns Hopkins APL,"World’s first high-performance Peltier refrigerator with nano thin-film tech represents leap toward refrigerant-free cooling

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced it has published a joint research paper titled “Nano-Engineered Thin-Film Thermoelectric Materials Enable Practical Solid-State Refrigeration” with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). The paper details the development of a next-generation Peltier cooling technology and was published in the prestigious multidisciplinary journal Nature Communications.

Peltier devices achieve cooling via the Peltier effect, in which applying an electric current to a semiconductor causes one side to cool and the other to heat. As it requires no refrigerants, this method is gaining traction as a next-generation alternative to refrigerants that offers a lower-impact solution.

The paper is the result of a collaborative project between researchers from Samsung Research’s Life Solution Team and Dr. Rama Venkatasubramanian’s thermoelectrics research team within the physics, electronic materials and devices research program at APL.

Demonstration of World’s First High-Performance Peltier Refrigerator Opens the Door to Commercialization

By leveraging newly created thin-film Peltier semiconductor devices advanced through cutting-edge nano-engineering technology for the first time, the research team has successfully developed and demonstrated a high-performance Peltier refrigerator.

This thin-film Peltier refrigerator surpasses the cooling efficiency of traditional vapor compression refrigerators, creating the potential for the commercialization of next-generation refrigerators without refrigerants.

Compared to traditional vapor compression methods, Peltier cooling enables fast and precise temperature control with a simpler configuration, making it applicable to various industrial fields, including home appliances, semiconductors, medical devices, automotive electronics, and data centres.

Nanofabrication Boosts Cooling and Resource Efficiency, Paving the Way for Solutions with Reduced Environmental Impact

For the commercialization of high-performance Peltier cooling, achieving superior cooling efficiency in Peltier semiconductor devices is essential.

Samsung and the APL research team have done this by improving the efficiency of Peltier devices by nearly 75% through the use of new thin-film semiconductor materials as well as miniaturization and lightweight design.

The newly developed Peltier device demonstrated significant advantages in terms of resource efficiency and mass production. The research team confirmed that the new manufacturing process not only drastically reduced the amount of Peltier materials required down to about 1/1,000 of the material typically required, but also simplified the production steps. This advancement enhanced scalability and enabled mass production, with promising prospects for significant gains in both cost-effectiveness and environmental impact.

Fashion retailers issued warning on potential greenwashing,"In the letter (9-page /329 KB), the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN) sets out a number of principles for retailers when making environmental claims to raise standards and compliance across the fashion industry and ensure consumers are able to make informed choices about their purchases.

Firstly, the letter urges retailers to avoid using vague and general claims such as describing items of clothing as “conscious”, “green” or “sustainable”. It also cautions traders against overstating the significance of environmental measures they have taken and asks them to ensure that any improvements made are marketed in a “proportionate” way and not given “undue emphasis in” marketing.

In one example, it states that while reducing the amount of water used in making jeans can be considered a positive improvement, in reality this reduction should not be overemphasised, since it could constitute only “a small fraction of the overall emissions and negative environmental impact of the production of the jeans”.

The letter also calls on retailers to avoid making claims based on data that is not sufficiently specific to the product, such as claiming that an item of clothing automatically has a lower environmental impact because it is made of organic cotton instead of conventional cotton. ICPEN warns against using self-made labelling schemes and misuse of third-party certifications, adding that labels “should give an accurate impression of the environmental performance of the product.”

Retailers should also be specific when using “sustainability” filters in online stores and should focus their marketing on specific measures already being taken, rather than making unsubstantiated claims about future aspirations.

There have been concerns over potential greenwashing in advertising campaigns across the fashion industry for some time. Scrutiny has fallen particularly on the fashion retail sector, which, as the letter indicates, is currently responsible for an estimated 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 20% of global wastewater. In Ireland, the CCPC, together with the Advertising Standards Authority, is responsible for policing greenwashing claims with the former having a variety of enforcement mechanisms at its disposal, from compliance notices to criminal prosecution, to enforce compliance.

In 2024 the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority issued a compliance guide and advised 17 high-profile brands to review their green claims. In 2023 research by Greenpeace found that 39% of sustainability claims in the textile, garment and shoe sector could be false or deceptive.

ICPEN is a network of more than 70 consumer protection law enforcement authorities worldwide. Ireland’s consumer rights watchdog, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC); the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission; and the Spanish Directorate General for Consumer Affairs, were among the 20 global organisations that endorsed the letter.

In a statement accompanying the letter on ICPEN’s website, the organisation said that it “does not necessarily indicate that any individual ICPEN member will prioritise enforcement action on misleading environmental claims, and some member jurisdictions may have stricter or more specific rules in place.”

Jane Bourke and Isabel Humburg, who specialise in advertising clearance at Pinsent Masons, said the letter should serve as a wake-up call for retailers. “The risk of enforcement action or reputational damage from greenwashing is now very real. This letter from ICPEN reinforces the growing regulatory expectation that environmental claims in advertising – and particularly in the fashion sector – must be clear, specific, and substantiated. Vague descriptors like ‘sustainable’ or ‘green’ are no longer acceptable without robust evidence. Retailers must ensure that any environmental messaging is proportionate to the actual impact of the measures taken and avoid overstating benefits.”

Bourke and Humburg urged marketers to work closely with legal teams from the outset to develop external messaging that would “verify claims, avoid misleading generalisations, and ensure that any certifications or labels used are credible and accurately reflect the product’s environmental performance.”",https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/fashion-retailers-greenwashing-warning,Business
Hexcel Presents Lightweight Aerospace Composite Innovations at 55th International Paris Air Show,"Hexcel Corporation [NYSE: HXL] will demonstrate its latest developments for the Aerospace markets at the Paris Air Show 2025, Le Bourget, Paris, 16 – 22 June 2025.

Russian central bank warns of oil price risks as it defends high rates,"A Russian state flag flies over the Central Bank headquarters in Moscow, Russia, August 15, 2023. A sign reads: ""Bank of Russia"". REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab

MOSCOW, May 28 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank defended its tight monetary policy in a report on Wednesday, saying high rates had contributed to a slowdown in lending and fostered signs of disinflation, but pointed to low oil prices as a key risk for the Russian economy.

The central bank, battling stubbornly high inflation, has stood firm for months against growing pressure to ease borrowing costs, with critical companies cutting investment plans and the government bemoaning slowing economic growth.

Sign up here.

Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov on Monday said the cooling economy was facing ""hypothermia"" risks as he urged the central bank to take slowing inflation into account when it next meets to set interest rates on June 6.

""Tight monetary policy is a temporary factor, necessary for a sustainable reduction in inflation,"" the bank, which has held its key interest rate at 21% since October, said in a financial stability review.

Soaring military spending in the last two years has generated economic growth but fuelled inflation, causing overheating that the central bank has sought to cool with high rates. Russia's growth domestic product growth slowed to 1.4% in the first quarter, from 4.5% a quarter earlier.

External conditions remain difficult, the bank said, pointing to risks from global market volatility, trade wars and the prospect of increased sanctions against Moscow.

Further drops in prices for Russia's export goods, particularly oil, could become a ""key risk"" for Russia, the bank said. Price drops can reduce revenue for exporting companies and, in turn, the budget.

However, financial stability risks overall are limited due to Russia's low debt and reserves accumulated during years of high oil prices, the bank said.

The bank said increased credit restructuring by large and medium-sized Russian companies at the end of March was a temporary trend, expressing confidence that a majority of firms was resilient to interest rate risk.

Nevertheless, banks must conduct regular stress tests of the stability of their corporate loan portfolios, the bank said.

Summary No decision taken but Macron favours Palestinian recognition

Paris wants to create momentum as two-state solution dissipates

Israeli lobbies to convince Paris to change course

PARIS, May 28 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron is leaning towards recognising a Palestinian state, but diplomats and experts say such a move may prove a premature and ineffective way to pressure Israel into moving towards a peace deal with the Palestinians.

They say it could deepen Western splits, not only within the already-divided European Union, but also with the United States, Israel's staunchest ally, and would need to be accompanied by other measures such as sanctions and trade bans if recognition were to be anything more than a symbolic gesture.

Sign up here.

French officials are weighing up the move ahead of a United Nations conference, which France and Saudi Arabia are co-hosting between June 17-20, to lay out the parameters for a roadmap to a Palestinian state, while ensuring Israel's security.

""Only a political solution will make it possible to restore peace and build for the long term,"" Macron said on Wednesday during a visit to Indonesia

""Together with Saudi Arabia, we will soon be organising a conference on Gaza in New York to give fresh impetus to the recognition of a Palestinian state and the recognition of the State of Israel and its right to live in peace and security in this region,"" added Macron.

If Macron does go ahead, France, home to Europe's largest Jewish and Muslim communities, would become the first Western heavyweight to recognise a Palestinian state, potentially giving greater momentum to a movement hitherto dominated by smaller nations that are generally more critical of Israel.

""If France moves, several countries will follow,"" Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told Reuters.

Macron's stance has shifted amid Israel's intensified Gaza offensive and escalating violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, and there is a growing sense of urgency in Paris to act now before the idea of a two-state solution vanishes forever.

""We must move from words to deeds. Faced with facts on the ground, the prospect of a Palestinian state must be maintained. Irreversible and concrete measures are necessary,"" Macron's Middle East adviser Anne-Claire Legendre said last week.

Diplomats caution that while Macron now favours the move, he has yet to make a final decision, and things could change - including a potential Gaza ceasefire accord - before mid-June.

However, his diplomats are scrambling to ensure the best conditions are in place for him to make the decision, including full assessments at the UN conference on the reform of the Palestinian Authority, disarming Hamas or future reconstruction.

ISRAELI LOBBYING

Israeli officials have spent months lobbying to prevent what some have described as ""a nuclear bomb"" for bilateral relations.

The idea that France, one of Israel's closest allies and a G7 member, could recognise a Palestinian state, would certainly infuriate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

When Britain and Canada joined France this month to say they could impose concrete measures on Israel and commit to recognising a Palestinian state, Netanyahu issued a firm rebuke, accusing the leaders of the three countries of antisemitism.

Diplomats say Canada and Britain remain lukewarm for now about recognition, suggesting the priority is to make a difference on the ground, something that may dampen Macron's ambitions.

According to two sources familiar with the matter, Israel's warnings to France have ranged from scaling back intelligence sharing to complicating Paris' regional initiatives - even hinting at possible annexation of parts of the West Bank.

Whether that would materialise seems unlikely, given the likely international fallout fuelling one of Israel's greatest fears: deepening isolation, particularly with regard to Europe, its key trade partner.

""(But) the reaction will be negative across the board (in Israel),"" Tamir Hayman, Executive Director at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) told Reuters, adding it would feed an ultra-right narrative in Israel that the world is against it. ""It would be useless and a waste of time.""

SHIFTING FRENCH VIEWS

Macron strongly backed Israel after Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. But he has steadily sharpened his language against Israel over its actions in Gaza, where the death toll among Palestinians has risen to more than 50,000, according to Palestinian health officials.

""We need to move towards recognition. Over the next few months, we will,"" Macron said during an interview on April 9.

Even then, he hedged, setting vague conditions and saying he aimed to build momentum with a coalition backing France while nudging Muslim states toward recognising Israel.

However, there are no indications for now that any new Muslim states - including Saudi Arabia - are ready to move towards normalising ties with Israel, given the widespread anger over Gaza's plight.

Macron's critics argue that recognition should come as part of negotiations towards a two-state solution - not before - and warning that an early move could weaken incentives for Palestinians to engage.

Underlining divisions within the EU, one European diplomat said: ""It is our view that this recognition would not be helpful now or encourage more action within the member states.""

Others say recognition must be twinned with other measures such as a Europe-wide ban on trade with illegal Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territories and specific sanctions on Israeli officials.

French officials say they will not be swayed by such criticism or by the Israeli pressure.

""If there is a moment in history to recognise a Palestinian state even if it's just symbolic then I would say that moment has probably come,"" said a senior French official, adding that Macron may also want to leave a trace in history before his presidential mandate expires in 2027.

"Utilities Require Global Cooperation, Sustainable Solutions: Sri Lankan Labour Minister","(@FahadShabbir)

ABU DHABI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 28th May, 2025) Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Sri Lankan Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development, said that the utilities sector has become a critical global concern that directly impacts human well-being and requires sustainable, collaborative solutions.

Speaking to the Emirates news Agency (WAM) during the World Utilities Congress 2025 in Abu Dhabi, Fernando called for international cooperation and integrated approaches to address the sector’s growing challenges, framing it as a humanitarian and development issue.

He noted that the congress provides a strategic platform to exchange ideas, engage with global stakeholders, and build sustainable partnerships to address complex utility-related issues.

Fernando highlighted Sri Lanka’s national plan to derive 70 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, with a long-term goal of reaching 100 percent, aligning with global efforts to reduce fossil fuel dependence and combat climate change.

Regarding water, he acknowledged that while Sri Lanka is generally well-resourced, some areas face growing challenges in accessing clean drinking water. He called for innovative solutions and stronger cooperation with institutions like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, as well as enhanced community-based water management.

He also advocated for People-Public-Private Partnerships (PPPPs) as an effective model for financing and delivering essential utility infrastructure, particularly in support of long-term sustainable development.

Fernando described the congress as timely and relevant, underscoring the urgency of shifting from conventional to renewable energy sources.",https://www.urdupoint.com/en/middle-east/utilities-require-global-cooperation-sustain-1987493.html,World

Palestinians struggle to receive cooked food distributed at a community kitchen in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis, in the Gaza Strip, May 23, 2025.

In the more than two months since Israeli forces resumed military operations in Gaza -- breaking the ceasefire -- international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization said the humanitarian crisis has worsened in the strip.

The resumption of hostilities followed a blockade on all humanitarian aid, which has caused widespread malnutrition and famine-like conditions, according to food security experts at the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative.

As aid finally re-enters Gaza, the Israeli government has claimed Hamas is stealing aid meant for civilians, which Hamas disputes.

Meanwhile, strikes by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) -- in an attempt to target Hamas and to pressure the militant group to release the remaining 58 hostages -- have resulted in the accidental deaths of paramedics and humanitarian workers.

ABC News takes a look at key dates and developments since the temporary ceasefire ended.

March 18

Israeli forces resume military operations after a six-week temporary ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. It comes after Israel imposed a total humanitarian aid blockade on March 2 to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages.

March 19

The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health (MOH) said five United Nations (U.N.) staffers have been injured after an attack in central Gaza and one staffer has died.

The IDF denies reports that it struck a U.N. compound in Deir al Balah. The IDF acknowledges about a month later that it struck the facility by mistake.

March 24

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) released a statement saying one of its headquarters in Rafah was struck by an ""explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties.""

The IDF says it mistakenly struck the ICRC building after an ""incorrect"" identification of a supposed threat.

In a statement, the U.N. said the video ""appears to show Israeli tanks firing on clearly marked emergency vehicles, refuting claims that the ambulances were unidentifiable or operating without sirens.""

After the emergence of the video, the IDF said in a statement to ABC News that the incident was ""under thorough examination.""

April 6

The Hamas-run Government Media Office in Gaza claims the southern city of Rafah has been transformed into a ""closed military zone.""

The IDF confirms to ABC News that it has not declared the city of Rafah a closed military zone but that it is operating in the area against Hamas targets.

"China’s premier tells ASEAN, Gulf nations to remove trade barriers","China's Premier Li Qiang attends a meeting with US Climate Envoy John Kerry at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on July 18, 2023. — AFP/File

BEIJING: Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday urged Southeast Asian and Gulf countries to remove trade barriers and expand opening up amid rising protectionism, and said Beijing is confident it can stabilise its economy in the face of challenges.

Li was speaking at a dinner event during a leaders’ summit in Kuala Lumpur with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council. “Facing rising protectionism and unilateralism in some places of the world, we must be committed to expanding opening up and removing barriers,” Li said, without naming any countries.

“Economic globalisation is currently experiencing an unprecedented major impact,” Li said, urging the countries to uphold a multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organisation at its core.

US President Donald Trump’s trade war is upending the global economy, with his administration and the Chinese government engaging in tit-for-tat tariff hikes before walking back most of the increases following negotiations.

Trade tensions with the US have fuelled concerns for China’s economy, which has been reliant on an export-driven recovery amid sluggish demand and deflationary pressures at home. Li said China’s economy has continued to recover and improve since the beginning of the year, and that Chinese exports have remained “resilient despite external pressure”. China’s fiscal expenditure will reach a record high this year and the government is directing more policy resources towards consumption to unleash demand potential, he added.",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315899-china-s-premier-tells-asean-gulf-nations-to-remove-trade-barriers,World
Israel says it has hit Houthi targets including last plane at Sanaa airport,"JERUSALEM/ADEN, May 28 (Reuters) - Israel said it had struck Houthi targets including the last remaining plane used by the group at Sanaa international airport, after the Yemeni militants launched missiles towards Israel a day earlier.

The General Director of Sanaa International Airport, Khaled al-Shaief, said in a post on his X account that the strike had completely destroyed the last of the civilian planes that Yemenia Airways was operating from the airport.

The airport is the largest in Yemen and came back into service last week after temporary repairs and runway restoration following previous Israeli strikes.

It was mainly being used by U.N. aircraft and the plane destroyed in the latest Israeli strikes. Three other Yemenia Airways planes were destroyed in an attack earlier this month

""This is a clear message and a direct continuation of the policy we have established: whoever fires at the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,"" Israel's defence ministry said in a statement.

The Houthis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Part of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance,"" a regional alliance that includes Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis control territory where about 60% of Yemen's population resides.

Since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, the group has fired at Israel and at shipping in the Red Sea in what it says are acts of solidarity with the Palestinians.

Most of the dozens of missiles and drones fired towards Israel have been intercepted or fallen short. Israel has carried out a series of retaliatory strikes.

The U.S. also launched intensified strikes against the Houthis this year, before halting the campaign after the Houthis agreed to stop attacks on U.S. ships.

In a statement on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that any harm directed at Israel will be met with greater force.

""But, as I have said more than once, the Houthis are only the symptom. The main driving force behind them is Iran, which is responsible for the aggression emanating from Yemen,"" Netanyahu said.

Pakistan calls for upholding sanctity of holy sites in Palestine,"Pakistan calls for upholding sanctity of holy sites in Palestine

Pakistan has called for upholding the sanctity and historical status of the holy sites, and preventing Israel from any further provocations.

In a statement, the Foreign Office strongly condemned the latest provocative actions by Israeli occupying power and illegal settlers aimed at undermining the religious, historical and legal status of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

The statement said such actions are unacceptable and constitute a flagrant violation of the international law, and can further escalate an already volatile situation in the region.

The Foreign Office said Pakistan calls for upholding the sanctity and historical status of the holy sites, and preventing Israel from any further provocations.

The Foreign Office said Pakistan strongly deplores the continued targeting of the Palestinian civilians in Gaza by the occupying power.

The Foreign Office statement quoted the latest reprehensible attack against a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza as an example of continued Israeli impunity. The harrowing images of the attack that resulted in dozens of deaths including children, should be a wake-up call for the international community.

The Foreign Office called for a forthwith end to these attacks, and emphasized that Israel must be held accountable for its heinous crimes.

"Amid calls for arms embargo, who supplies Israel's weapons? – DW – 05","Spain has called for an arms embargo on Israel, as violence in Gaza escalates. But real pressure would require action from three major weapons exporters.

Spain has asked European countries to suspend arms shipments to Israel, as international condemnation grows over its conduct in Gaza.

At a meeting of the ""Madrid Group"" hosted by the Spanish government, the Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an immediate suspension of Europe's cooperation deal with Israel and an embargo on arms shipments.

""We must all agree on a joint arms embargo,"" said Albares prior to the conference. ""The last thing the Middle East needs right now is weapons.""

Among those at the meeting were representatives from Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Morocco and Brazil, along with several intergovernmental organizations.

However, only a fraction of the nations represented at the Madrid Group meeting actually supply Israel with armaments.

Israel is also one of the world's top exporters of armaments, so it has a powerful internal supply of weaponry as well.

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in March reported that Israel is the 15th biggest importer of arms globally, despite it being actively involved in conflict, accounting for less than 2% of global imports.

Its imports have also dropped by around 2.3% in the last five years, compared to the preceding period.

Crucially, three nations account for almost all of Israel's weapons supply: the United States, Germany and Italy.

US is Israel's biggest arms supplier

By far, the US is the biggest arms supplier to Israel, both since the October 7, 2023 attacks and also historically.

Though its proportional supply has reduced over the last decade, it still accounted for about two-thirds of Israel's imports from 2020 to 2024, according to SIPRI.

This includes aircraft, armored vehicles and guided bombs.

Israel is also the top recipient of US aid historically, according to the US-based, nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

As well as a substantial economic contribution between 1946 and 2024, Israel has received $228 billion (€200 billion) in military support from the US.

Today, most US foreign aid to Israel is military spending. This includes an existing agreement to provide $3.8 billion in support until 2028. Most aid provided by the US must be spent on the purchase of American military equipment and services, according to the CFR.

It's unlikely that the US will change its support for Israel. Attempts led by independent senator Bernie Sanders to withhold billions in military sales to Israel were rejected by the US Senate in both April 2025 and November 2024.

Germany will continue to provide Israel weapons

Germany is a long-time diplomatic and military supporter of Israel. From 2020 to 2024, Germany accounted for about a third of Israel's incoming arms supply, mostly naval frigates and torpedoes.

SIPRI researcher Zain Hussain told DW via email that ""Israel has relied on Germany for […] naval capabilities,"" and that Israel has an incoming submarine order from Germany.

Germany's arms supply to Israel has also included armored vehicles, trucks, anti-tank weapons and ammunition.

And that is unlikely to change, despite Spain's calls for an embargo.

""As a country that understands Israel's security and existence as a core principle, Germany is always obliged to assist Israel,"" said German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Monday.

Those comments came as German Chancellor Frederich Merz told public broadcaster WDR he ""no longer understands"" Israel's objective in Gaza and that its actions could ""no longer be justified by a fight against Hamas.""

Despite Merz's remark, any future restriction on Germany's arms supply would be a significant development. Germany provided more than €131 million ($137 million) in arms exports in 2024, according to government statistics. The figure in 2023 was €326 million.

Italy accounts for 1% of Israel's arms

Italy contributes around 1% of Israel's weapons. But by Italian law, it is prohibited from doing so given the conflict.

The Italian government has been critical of Israel's actions, but reports last year found it continued to supply Israel following the commencement of hostilities in October 2023. That reportedly included €2.1 million ($2.4 million) in the last quarter of 2023, during which Israel's offensive was underway. That was despite assurances from the Italian government that shipments had ceased.

Analysis performed on government accounts by Italian news outlet Altreconomia found Italy supplied €5.2 million in arms to Israel last year.

Some EU nations have reduced their exports

Israel has no shortage of armaments, either produced domestically or through its major backers. Despite pressure from European nations to adopt an arms embargo, Hussain said the most effective block would require Israel's primary armorers to join up.

""The USA and Germany are the most important suppliers of major arms to Israel. For there to be maximum pressure on Israel's major arms capabilities, these states would have to be involved in an arms embargo,"" Hussain said.

Some European nations have either stopped the supply of weaponry, or have suspended export licenses. These include France, Spain and the UK, though their contributions are less than 0.1% of Israel's total intake. However, a study of UK trade data, cited by The Guardian in May, found that the country sent Israel thousands of military items despite the export ban.

A major change in US foreign policy would be required for Germany to heed Spain's call, said Catherine Gegout, an international relations researcher at the University of Nottingham in the UK.

""I think there would be much more pressure on Germany if the US changed as well,"" Gegout told DW. ""But I'm not sure the rest of the EU states [opposing arms] will be enough to change that special relationship with Israel.""

Despite Germany's long-standing commitment to Israel, Gegout said its ongoing weapons supply is becoming a problem for the European Union.

""I think it's a gigantic problem for the EU that Germany is sending so many weapons,"" Gegout said.

She said Spain's attempt to implement an arms embargo serves both a direct and symbolic purpose for countries that may oppose Israel's activities in Gaza.

What caused the flight to turn back twice for Libyan Hajj pilgrim?,"Amer Al Mahdi Mansour Al Gaddafi poses for photo alongside flight crew. — Facebook/Masroor Shaheen/File

In an unusual incident, a plane carrying intending Hajj pilgrims from Libya to Saudi Arabia was forced to make two emergency landings due to technical faults midair—before eventually taking onboard a “blessed” pilgrim, Amer Al Mahdi Mansour Al Gaddafi.

Gaddafi — a young man from Libya — left his house with the intention of performing Hajj — the fifth pillar of Islam — but trouble struck at the airport when he was held back at immigration due to a security delay linked to his surname — Al Gaddafi — still flagged in some systems over a decade after Libya’s civil unrest, Gulf News reported.

While his companions boarded the flight, Gaddafi was still being held at the counter. Despite his pleas, the flight captain reportedly insisted on departing without him, citing security uncertainty and scheduling constraints.

However, Gaddafi's faith remained unshaken. “I will not leave this airport until I depart for Hajj,” he told the airport authorities.

Shortly after takeoff, the plane developed a technical malfunction and was forced to return. After a delay and minor repairs, it took off again, only to encounter a second issue, forcing another return.

According to passengers and crew, it was after the second emergency landing that the captain announced: “I swear I won’t fly again unless Amer is with us on this plane.”

Authorities swiftly cleared Gaddafi for travel. On the third attempt, with Amer aboard, the flight departed without incident.

“I only wanted to go to Hajj,” Gaddafi later said on local media. “And I believed that if it was written for me, no force could prevent it.”",https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1315867-what-caused-the-flight-to-turn-back-twice-for-libyan-hajj-pilgrim,World
Zelenskyy: Putin irritates Trump more than I do,"Zelenskyy said he thinks that President Trump and his administration — looking for a quick cessation of hostilities — have now understood that Putin does not want to end his full-scale invasion of Ukraine the way the White House wants it to.

While he has continued to scold Zelenskyy, Trump warned Putin on Tuesday that he is “playing with fire” as the Kremlin continues to bombard Ukraine with a record number of drones.

“What Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He’s playing with fire!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

Zelenskyy — who had an infamous blow-up with Trump in the Oval Office in late February — still wants the U.S. to impose further sanctions on Russia, as only intensifying pressure can force Moscow to think about peace, he told the assembled journalists.

While the EU approved a 17th round of sanctions following Russia’s refusal of Ukraine’s 30-day ceasefire offer, the U.S. has not imposed new penalties since. Following his meeting with Trump at the Vatican in late April, however, the Ukrainian president became more confident the White House would impose sanctions on Russia if Putin refuses to agree to a ceasefire.

Zelenskyy reiterated his willingness to engage in dialogue with the Russians “in any format,” including direct talks with Putin or with Trump’s mediation. Still, he would prefer Americans were present at talks about a ceasefire and Europeans at talks about postwar security guarantees, since they will be the ones providing those commitments.",https://www.politico.eu/article/zelenskyy-i-think-putin-irritates-the-white-house-more-than-i-do/,World
India likely to receive above-average monsoon rains in 2025,"A man carrying an umbrella runs as he crosses a busy road during rain in Kolkata, India. — Reuters/File

India is likely to see above-average monsoon rains for the second straight year in 2025, the government said on Tuesday, maintaining its forecast from April and keeping alive the possibility of higher farm output and economic growth.

Good rains will help bring down food prices, keep inflation within the central bank's comfort band, and allow the world's biggest rice exporter to ship more of the staple.

The monsoon is expected to total 106% of the long-term average this year, said M. Ravichandran, secretary in the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

The India Meteorological Department defines average rainfall as ranging between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the four-month season from June to September.

The monsoon delivers nearly 70% of the rain needed to water crops and replenish reservoirs and aquifers in India. With nearly half of the country's farmland not having any irrigation, it depends on the June-September rains to grow several crops.

Above-average rainfall is most likely over the central and southern India, while southwestern parts of the country could receive average rainfall, Ravichandran said.

Northeastern states are likely to receive below-average rainfall, he said.

The country is likely to receive 108% of the long-term average rainfall in June, Ravichandran said.

The monsoon, which usually arrives over the southern tip of Kerala state around June 1, hit the coast of Kerala on Saturday, eight days earlier than usual, marking its earliest arrival in 16 years.

After covering Kerala, it quickly moved to most parts of the west coast, including the financial capital Mumbai, nearly two weeks earlier than normal.

The forecast of above-average rainfall will lead to higher planting of water-intensive crops such as rice and sugarcane, a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trade house said.

""Already, soil moisture levels are better this year because of higher pre-monsoon rainfall. Now IMD forecasting surplus rainfall will give farmers confidence,"" he said.

India is the world's biggest exporter of rice and onions, and the second-biggest producer of sugar. Following surplus rainfall in 2024, India lifted curbs on rice and onion exports but allowed limited sugar exports of 1 million tons.

""If the rains stay good all season, rice and sugar production could be higher this year, and India might end up exporting more,"" a New Delhi-based dealer said.",https://www.geo.tv/latest/606473-india-likely-to-receive-above-average-monsoon-rains-in-2025,World
EU says Israeli strikes in Gaza 'go beyond what is necessary' to fight Hamas,"EU says Israeli strikes in Gaza 'go beyond what is necessary' to fight Hamas

Getty Images The northern Gazan city of Jabalia is among the areas targeted by Israeli bombing this week

The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has said that ""Israeli strikes in Gaza go beyond what is necessary to fight Hamas"" as the death toll there continues to mount. Kallas also said that the EU did not support a new aid distribution model backed by the US and Israel which bypasses the UN and other humanitarian organisations. ""We don't support the privatisation of the distribution of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid can not be weaponised"", she said. Israeli air strikes and other military actions since it resumed the war in March following a ceasefire have killed 3,924 people, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel says it is acting to destroy Hamas and get back hostages the group holds.

Recent Israel bombardments have killed large numbers of civilians. Last Friday an air strike in Khan Younis killed nine of a Palestinian doctor's 10 children. At least 35 people were killed in a school building sheltering displaced families in northern Gaza overnight into Monday. Kallas' remarks follows an intervention by new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz who declared he ""no longer understands"" Israel's objectives in the besieged enclave. ""The way in which the civilian population has been affected... can no longer be justified by a fight against Hamas terrorism,"" he said. The EU is one of the largest donors of humanitarian aid to Gaza, yet Kallas said most of it was currently unable to get to Palestinians who need it. Israel imposed a complete blockade on Gaza in March and only began allowing a trickle of aid in after 11 weeks. ""The majority of the aid to Gaza is provided by the EU but it's not reaching the people as it is blocked by Israel,"" Kallas said. ""The suffering of the people is untenable."" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meanwhile described recent Israeli attacks on Gaza's civilian infrastructure as ""abhorrent"" and ""disproportionate"". It also follows the strongest criticism yet by the UK, France and Canada, who demanded Israel end its military offensive in Gaza. The UK later said it was suspending trade talks with Israel. The EU has launched a formal review of its own trade agreement with Israel and Kallas said she would present ""options"" at the upcoming EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on 23 June.

UN agencies have warned that Gaza's 2.1 million population is facing catastrophic levels of hunger after an almost three-month Israeli blockade that was eased last week. Israel and the US are backing a new aid distribution system run by a controversial new group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF's aid distribution system uses US security contractors and bypasses the UN, which has rejected it as unethical and unworkable. The US and Israeli governments have said it is preventing aid from being stolen by Hamas, which the armed group denies doing.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj937k0wg3do,World
Why pro-Russian media is focusing on a viral video of French President Macron,"Why pro-Russian media is focusing on a viral video of French President Macron

A video showing French President Emmanuel Macron's wife appearing to shove him in the face has gone viral. Macron has said the two were just sharing a moment of closeness.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

A video showing French President Emmanuel Macron's wife shoving him in the face has gone viral. Macron says that the two are just sharing a moment of closeness. As NPR's Jaclyn Diaz reports, this moment has taken on a life of its own in pro-Russian media.

JACLYN DIAZ, BYLINE: The video is just a few seconds long. French President Emmanuel Macron is standing in the open doorway of a plane after touching down in Vietnam. He's standing in profile, talking, when suddenly a pair of red-sleeved arms reach out and push him in the face. Moments later, he puts a smile on his face and waves at the camera. French first lady Brigitte Macron, wearing a red jacket, appears as they leave the plane. Macron's office says it was just the married couple sharing a silly moment. So why has it gained so much attention?

DARREN LINVILL: If any video like that came out for anyone in his position, it would go viral in today's digital environment.

DIAZ: That was Darren Linvill, a Clemson University professor specializing in social media disinformation. Linvill says he's seen the video take hold in corners of Russian media and pro-Russian propaganda on social media. Disinformation experts like Linvill say pro-Russian actors are using the video to suggest that Macron is weak and emasculated.

LINVILL: Bad actors, especially the Russians, take advantage of real videos like this all of the time to spin the message and the story that they want to tell.

DIAZ: This is not the first time Macron has been targeted on social media. When Macron met German and British leaders earlier this month on a train to Ukraine, some conspiracy theorists said photos of the meeting showed a bag of cocaine on the table. Macron's office said it was a tissue, and Macron's office said the conspiracy theories were fake news spread by France's enemies. Linvill says Macron is a prime target for misinformation.

LINVILL: He is the leader of the Western world, the leader - the most prominent advocate and voice in NATO, and that makes him target No. 1 for Russia.

DIAZ: Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at The New School, says that to Russians, the video is presented to make Macron look weak compared to Putin. Macron has wanted the West to amp up pressure on Putin over the war in Ukraine.

NINA KHRUSHCHEVA: Because Macron is so big on being tough on Russia, and they're showing him like, oh, he's tough on Russia. Look at this. He's not even tough on his wife.

DIAZ: She said there's an opportunity for pro-Russian voices to present it as a contrast to the strongman image of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The goal is to undermine the legitimacy of Macron and the West, according to Linvill.

LINVILL: Russia and China and other countries that stand in opposition to the West and to NATO are looking to chip away at what remains of those traditions and those standards.

DIAZ: And Linvill says these attacks on social media against leaders like Macron who are trying to uphold democracy in Europe will likely continue.

UAE summons Israeli ambassador over Jerusalem rally 'violations',"DUBAI, May 28 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates summoned Israel's ambassador to the country to express its condemnation of ""provocative practices by Israeli extremists"" during a rally in Jerusalem earlier this week, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.

On Monday, a large rally in Jerusalem marking Israel's capture of the city's east in the 1967 war descended into chaos as far-right Israeli Jews confronted and assaulted Palestinians, fellow Israelis and journalists, witnesses said.

The annual ""Flag March"" drew tens of thousands of people, who chanted, danced and waved Israeli flags after far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir visited the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, a flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions.

WAM said the UAE condemned ""the deplorable and offensive violations against the Palestinian people that took place in the courtyard of Al-Aqsa Mosque"".

It said the Gulf state had urged the Israeli government ""to assume full responsibility, condemn these hostile acts, hold perpetrators accountable without exception to ministers and officials"".

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The UAE is one of the few Arab countries that have normalised relations with Israel, under the Abraham Accords.

Many airlines pulled out of Syria during its 14-year civil war. International flights also stopped for a period after rebels toppled former President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but then resumed with services currently offered by Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines and Royal Jordanian as well as Syrian carriers.

United Arab Emirates-based FlyDubai has said it will resume services from June.

U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration last week issued orders effectively lifting sanctions on Syria. Trump said he did so at the behest of Saudi Arabia's crown prince.

EU foreign ministers also agreed last week to lift economic sanctions on Syria.

LONDON -- A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that President Donald Trump ""is not getting enough information"" about Moscow's war on Ukraine, after Trump criticized Putin for his apparent reluctance to pursue a peace deal and warned that the Kremlin was ""playing with fire.""

""There is a lot that Trump says, we read it all, track it, but in many ways we come to the conclusion that Trump is not getting enough information about what is really happening in the context of the Ukrainian-Russian confrontation,"" Yuri Ushakov said in an interview with Russian propagandist Pavel Zarubin published on Wednesday.

""In particular, he is not being informed enough about what massive terrorist attacks are being carried out by Ukraine against peaceful Russian cities,"" Ushakov said. ""Trump only knows what countermeasures we are taking, and he does not fully understand that we are attacking military institutions or military industrial complexes.""

The comments came after hundreds of Ukrainian drones crossed into Russia overnight into Wednesday morning, dozens of which targeted Moscow and again caused disruption to flights in and out of the capital, according to officials there.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces shot down 296 Ukrainian drones over 12 regions -- including the capital Moscow -- during the latest round of long-range strikes.

Moscow Governor Andrei Vorobyov said on Telegram that at least 42 drones were downed over the region. Vorobyov reported damage to three homes in the town of Chekhov around 40 miles south of the capital.

Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport -- one of four international airports in the capital -- also warned travelers of delays due to flight restrictions imposed during the latest drone attack. Recent weeks have seen regular disruptions to Moscow's airports during such strikes.

Andriy Kovalenko, the head of the Counter-Disinformation Center operating as part of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said on Telegram there were ""some pretty good hits"" during Tuesday night's attack.

Among the targets were the Dubna Machine-Building Plant -- involved in the production of aviation, missile and drone technology, Kovalenko said -- in the city of Dubna, around 70 miles north of Moscow.

Kovalenko said the Technopark ELMA-Zelenograd facility -- which hosts the development of microelectronics, IT, robotics and medical equipment -- was also targeted. The facility ""is one of the centers where import substitution of critical components previously imported from the West takes place,"" Kovalenko said.

ABC News could not immediately verify Kovalenko's claim of successful strikes on the facilities.

Russia continued its own long-range attacks on Ukraine overnight. Ukraine's air force said Moscow launched six missiles and 88 strike drones into the country, of which 71 drones were shot down or otherwise neutralized. The air force said it recorded impacts in eight locations.

The intensity of strikes by both sides have only increased since Trump's return to office in January, the president having promised to end Russia's war on its neighbor war in 24 hours. Trump has not delivered on that promise, and his frustration appears to have been building in recent weeks with the continued failure of U.S.-led ceasefire efforts.

Trump called Putin ""absolutely crazy"" in a Sunday social media post, then on Tuesday said Putin ""doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He’s playing with fire!""

Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Tuesday that Moscow was still working on the document.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cast doubt on the Russian proposal. ""They've already spent over a week on this,"" he wrote on social media on Tuesday. ""They talk a lot about diplomacy.

"Carcass of dolphin wash up at Alappuzha, triggers concern","Amid growing concerns over the scale of marine pollution caused by the cargo ship that sank off the Kochi coast last week, the carcass of a dolphin washed ashore near the Valiyazheekkal Beach in Alappuzha on Wednesday.

The discovery was made during a beach inspection led by S. Sheela, Assistant Professor of Zoology at TKMM College, Nagarkulangara, as part of a preparatory survey for a beach-cleaning initiative by the Ocean Society of India scheduled for June 8. A preliminary assessment of the carcass indicated that it was in an advanced stage of decomposition, suggesting the dolphin might have died before the shipwreck incident.

However, K.V. Jayachandran, vice-president of the Ocean Society of India, observed that if the dolphin had died after the shipwreck, it could potentially serve as an indicator of the broader impact of marine pollution in the area. He also noted that the carcass was found just 200 metres from the spot where a container filled with cotton had washed ashore two days earlier.

“The entire stretch of the beach is littered with plastic granules and it’s still unclear whether the cotton from the container is natural or synthetic,” he pointed out.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/carcass-of-dolphin-wash-up-at-alappuzha-triggers-concern/article69629520.ece,World
"Germany’s top diplomat heads to US for talks on Ukraine, NATO, trade","BERLIN: Germany’s Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul heads to the United States for talks Wednesday on the Ukraine and Mideast conflicts, NATO ties and rocky trade relations on his first Washington visit in the post.

After months of transatlantic tensions since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House, Wadephul stressed that decades-old bilateral ties had helped post-war Germany achieve “freedom and prosperity”.

“We Germans owe almost no other country as much as the United States,” he said in a statement before his departure for talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The new top diplomat under conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his talks would focus on the Ukraine war and “our common goals: We want to finally end the deaths in Ukraine, we want an immediate ceasefire and we want a lasting peace.”

“In order for Putin to finally come to the negotiating table, for Russia to finally enter into serious negotiations, we must maintain the pressure,” he added, pointing to European efforts to tighten sanctions.

Putin agrees with Trump to work with Ukraine on possible peace accord

Wadephul also said that “Putin’s Russia is the greatest threat to Euro-Atlantic security for the foreseeable future” and that “we in Europe are assuming greater responsibility for our own security”.

He reiterated that Germany supports a proposal by the NATO Secretary General to increase investment in defence and relevant infrastructure to five percent of GDP, referring to a plan to gradually raise military spending to 3.5 percent and security related spending to 1.5 percent of output.

On the Middle East conflict, he said “Germany stands by Israel’s security and existence” but also recognises “the unbearable suffering of the people in Gaza”.

“We urgently need a breakthrough in the negotiations on a ceasefire that leads to the release of the hostages and a massive expansion of humanitarian aid.”

Germany’s new foreign minister, in the post for three weeks, also touched on Trump’s tariff blitz against other countries and the European Union.

“In a globally connected world, we don’t want to erect new tariff barriers, but rather build stable bridges of partnership and trust,” Wadephul said.

“We support the European Commission in finding a balanced negotiated solution together with the USA to reduce unnecessary trade barriers between our countries and promote fair trade.

“Only in this way will we succeed in preserving prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic and strengthening our economic security. We – like our partners in the USA – will continue to confidently represent our interests around the world.”",https://www.brecorder.com/news/40364978/germanys-top-diplomat-heads-to-us-for-talks-on-ukraine-nato-trade,World
Divers cleaning up seabed raise alarm over marine pollution,"ALONISSOS: Off the Greek island of Alonissos in the eastern Aegean Sea, volunteer divers grab decaying plastic bottles, a tyre and a rusted anchor chain from the seabed and place them in a trash bag as part of an EU-funded cleanup to protect marine life.

The items recovered off Alonissos — a favourite tourist spot for its green-blue waters, and Europe’s largest protected marine park — represent just a tiny part of the tens of thousands of tons of waste that litter the Mediterranean Sea every year.

The park, set up off Alonissos in the early 1990s, is home to one of the world’s last remaining colonies of the Monk seal, and a refuge for over 300 fish species, dolphins and sea turtles.

Its existence has made both locals and tourists increasingly aware of the risks of marine pollution, said Theodora Francis, 31, one of the divers who joined the two-day initiative.

“We visited five, four areas to check whether we find rubbish in those areas,” Francis said. “In most of those areas we didn’t... but in some areas we did.” She said the main port of Votsi, where most tourism and fishing occurs, was the site of most litter.

To protect its coastal biodiversity, Greece has promised to create another two marine parks in the Aegean and the Ionian Sea in the west, part of 21 initiatives worth 780 million euros ($887.5 million).

Sexual violence in Sudan: “They beat us and they raped us right there on the road in public”,"In some cases, the attackers directly accused the survivors of supporting the other side.

“I have a certificate for first aid nursing. [When they stopped us], the RSF asked me to give them my bag. When they saw the certificate inside, they told me, ‘You want to heal the Sudanese army, you want to cure the enemy!’ Then they burnt my certificate, and they took me away to rape me,” says one woman. “They told everyone else to stay on the floor. I was with some other women, including my sister. They only raped me, because of my certificate.”

It is vital that victims and survivors access services after the attack, as sexual violence is a medical emergency. The immediate and long-lasting physical and psychological consequences which can be life-threatening. Yet survivors struggle to access medical care and protection because of a lack of services, limited awareness of the few services that exist, the high cost of traveling to facilities, and a reluctance to speak about the abuse due to shame, fear of stigma or retaliation.

“I cannot say anything to the community because it will be a shame for my family. So, I didn’t say anything about what happened to me before today. I’m only asking for medical help now,” says a survivor in eastern Chad. “I was too afraid to go to the hospital. My family told me, ‘Don’t tell anybody’.”

Where services exist, survivors need clear and accessible referral pathways to get the help they need. In South Darfur, the state with the greatest number of displaced people in Sudan, in late 2024, MSF added a community-based component to our care for survivors of sexual violence. Midwives and community healthcare workers were trained and equipped to provide emergency contraceptives and psychological first aid to survivors. They also supported survivors’ referral to clinics and hospitals where MSF teams work for comprehensive care. Since the addition of this community-based model, we have seen a steep increase in women and adolescents seeking care.

MSF teams continue to see new survivors of sexual violence. In Tawila, where people continue to arrive after attacks on Zamzam camp and in El Fasher, North Darfur, the hospital received 48 survivors of sexual violence between January and the beginning of May, most of them since the start of fighting in Zamzam camp in April.

“Access to services for survivors of sexual violence is lacking and, like most humanitarian and healthcare services in Sudan, must urgently be scaled up. People – mostly women and girls – who suffer sexual violence urgently need medical care, including psychological support, and protection services,” says Ruth Kauffman, MSF emergency medical manager. “Care must be tailored from the outset to mitigate against the many overwhelming barriers survivors face when seeking medical care in the aftermath of sexual violence.”

Brutal attacks and rapes must stop, warring parties must ensure that civilians are protected, respecting their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, and medical and humanitarian services for victims and survivors of sexual violence must be scaled up urgently in Darfur and eastern Chad.",https://www.msf.org/sexual-violence-sudan-%E2%80%9Cthey-beat-us-and-they-raped-us-right-there-road-public%E2%80%9D,World
"Hamas agrees to Gaza ceasefire deal, but Israel quickly rejects it","A senior Palestinian official claimed on Monday that Hamas had agreed to a new ceasefire proposal in Gaza, involving the release of Israeli hostages and a 70-day truce. However, Israeli officials swiftly dismissed the offer, denying it came from the United States and calling the terms unacceptable. The situation remains tense as both sides continue to disagree over terms for ending the conflict.

The Palestinian source, who is close to Hamas, said the proposal was shared by mediators and included the release of 10 Israeli hostages in two groups. In exchange, there would be a 70-day ceasefire and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. The deal also suggested releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.

However, US envoy Steve Witkoff, who was said to have made the proposal, denied this version. He told Reuters that the document being discussed was not his, and described the current terms as “completely unacceptable.” An Israeli official echoed that stance, adding that no responsible government could accept such a deal under current conditions.

Despite the rejection, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared cautiously hopeful in a recorded video message. He stated he hoped to provide updates on progress regarding the hostages and the conflict “today, or if not today, then tomorrow.” His office, however, did not issue further comment on the circulating proposal.

Tensions have remained high since March 18, when Israel ended a previous ceasefire agreement and resumed its military operations in Gaza. Hamas responded with renewed rocket attacks, continuing the cycle of violence. Since October 2023, Hamas has expressed willingness to release all remaining hostages if Israel agrees to a full withdrawal and permanent ceasefire.

Israel, on the other hand, maintains it will only accept a temporary truce in exchange for the hostages. Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed that the war will continue until Hamas is eliminated. The conflict has already claimed nearly 54,000 Palestinian lives, with massive destruction and growing humanitarian concerns in Gaza.",https://dailytimes.com.pk/1307294/hamas-agrees-to-gaza-ceasefire-deal-but-israel-quickly-rejects-it/,World

"Syria: EU adopts legal acts to lift economic sanctions on Syria, enacting recent political agreement","The Council has adopted legal acts lifting all economic restrictive measures on Syria, with the exception of those based on security grounds. The adoption formalises the political decision announced on 20 May 2025, and aims at supporting the Syrian people in reuniting and rebuilding a new, inclusive, pluralistic and peaceful Syria.

As part of the same approach, the Council has also removed 24 entities from the EU list of those subject to the freezing of funds and economic resources. Several of these entities are banks, including the Central Bank of Syria, or companies operating in key sectors for Syria’s economic recovery -such as oil production and refining, cotton, and telecommunications- while others are media and tv outlets.

This decision is simply the right thing to do, at this historic time, for the EU to genuinely support Syria’s recovery and a political transition that fulfils the aspirations of all Syrians. The EU has stood with the Syrian people throughout the last 14 years, and it will continue to do so. Today the EU reaffirms its commitment as a partner for the transition, one that helps the Syrian people to reunite and rebuild a new, inclusive, peaceful Syria. Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and President of the Foreign Affairs Council

In line with its call for accountability and its support to a peaceful transition, the Council has extended the listings of individuals and entities linked to the Assad regime until 1 June 2026.

In addition, in relation to the wave of violence that took place in Syria’s coastal region in March 2025, the Council has introduced new restrictive measures under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, targeting two individuals and three entities for serious human rights abuses.

The Council will continue monitoring developments on the ground and stands ready to introduce further restrictive measures against human rights violators and those fueling instability in Syria.

The legal acts will soon be published in the Official Journal.

Background

The EU has stood with the Syrian people throughout the last 14 years, engaging in the search for a political solution and leading financial assistance.

Following the fall of this regime, the Council on 24 February 2025 eased a number of EU restrictive measures in view of the situation in Syria in order to facilitate engagement with the country, its people and businesses.

On 20 May 2025, the Council affirmed its continued commitment to supporting the Syrian people and the peaceful transition by announcing the political decision to lift economic sanctions, marking a historic shift toward aiding Syria’s transition and recovery following the fall of the Assad regime.

The EU has continued to reaffirm its longstanding commitment to accountability, dating back to the crimes of the Assad regime, and monitored developments on the ground, including the steps undertaken by the transitional authorities following recent violence outbreaks. The EU has also consistently expressed its readiness to engaging with Syria’s transitional government and supporting a peaceful, inclusive future free from harmful foreign interference.",https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/05/28/syria-eu-adopts-legal-acts-to-lift-economic-sanctions-on-syria-enacting-recent-political-agreement/,World
Iran rejects US demand to suspend uranium enrichment,"TEHRAN: Iran on Monday ruled out suspending its uranium enrichment as part of any nuclear deal with the United States, a key demand from Washington in successive rounds of talks.

The issue of enrichment has come into focus in recent weeks, with Iran staunchly defending its right to enrich uranium, while the United States wants it to stop.

The negotiations, which began last month, are the highest-level contact between the two countries since the United States quit a landmark 2015 nuclear accord during US President Donald Trump’s first term.

Trump described the latest round of discussions in Rome as “very, very good”, while Iran’s foreign minister described the talks as “complicated”.

Since returning to office, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran, backing talks but warning of military action if diplomacy fails.

Tehran wants a new deal that would ease the sanctions which have battered its economy.

Western countries and Israel suspect Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, a charge it denies.

Steve Witkoff, the US envoy for Middle East, said that the United States “could not authorise even one per cent” enrichment by Iran.

‘Totally false’

On Monday, Iran ruled out any possibility of suspending its uranium enrichment in order to reach an agreement.

“This information is a figment of the imagination and totally false,” said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, asked about the possibility during a press briefing in Tehran.

Iran says it has the right to a civilian nuclear programme, including for energy, and considers the US demand a red line that violates the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it is a signatory.

Following the latest round of Omani-mediated talks in Rome, Iranian Foreign Minister and lead negotiator Abbas Araghchi downplayed the progress, stressing

that “the negotiations are too complicated to be resolved in two or three meetings”.

Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X that the fifth round concluded “with some but not conclusive progress”, adding that he hoped “the remaining issues” would be clarified in the coming days.

But on Sunday Trump said the ongoing discussions had been “very, very good”.

“I think we could have some good news on the Iran front,” he said, adding that an announcement could come “over the next two days”.

The talks came ahead of a June meeting of the UN nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), during which Iran’s nuclear activities will be reviewed.

They also come before the October expiry of the 2015 accord, which aimed to allay US and European Union suspicions that Iran was seeking nuclear weapons capability, an ambition that Tehran has consistently denied.

Iran has ramped up its nuclear activities since the collapse of the 2015 deal, and is now enriching uranium to 60 per cent — far above the deal’s 3.67 per cent cap, but below the 90 per cent needed for weapons-grade material.

Experts say that uranium enriched beyond 20 per cent can be further enriched to a weapons-grade level quickly.

"First Thing: Gaza influencer, 11, among dozens of children killed by recent Israeli strikes","Good morning.

Eleven-year-old Yaqeen Hammad, Gaza’s youngest social media influencer, is among the dozens of children killed by Israel in recent strikes as its forces intensify their military offensive across the Palestinian territory.

Known for her bright smile and volunteering efforts, Yaqeen was killed on Friday night after Israeli forces shelled the al-Baraka area of Deir al-Balah in northern Gaza, amid intense fighting in the region.

Yaqeen and her older brother, Mohamed Hammad, delivered food, toys and clothing to displaced families, Al Jazeera has reported.

She was also Gaza’s youngest influencer, offering practical survival tips for daily life under bombardment, such as advice on how to cook with improvised methods when there was no gas. In one social media post, Yaqeen wrote: “I try to bring a bit of joy to the other children so that they can forget the war.”

1:19 Dozens killed after Israeli attack on school used as shelter in Gaza – video report

How has Israel intensified its attacks on Gaza in recent days? Israeli airstrikes killed at least 52 people on Monday, including 31 in a school turned shelter that was struck as people slept, igniting their belongings, according to local health officials.

What is the latest with Israel’s aid blockade ? A US-backed group tasked with delivering supplies said it had begun operations on Monday, in a plan endorsed by Israel but rejected by the UN.

How are Israel’s allies responding? The UK, France and Canada have called for Israel to end the siege of Gaza, with the British foreign secretary calling Israeli actions “monstrous”. But, as Patrick Wintour explains in Today in Focus, allies have not yet used all the tools at their disposal.

Trump peppers Memorial Day speech with partisan attacks

Donald Trump honored the sacrifices of military veterans in the traditional presidential Memorial Day speech at Arlington national cemetery, but also peppered his address on Monday with partisan political asides while talking up his own plans.

The US president laid a wreath, paid tribute to fallen soldiers and gave accounts of battlefield courage. But he also veered off into rally-style personal boasting and anti-immigration rhetoric. His words followed a Truth Social tirade on Monday in which he called judges stalling his deportation aims – chiefly because of his ignoring due process – “monsters” and used sweeping disparagements of undocumented immigrants.

Who else is Trump attacking? Meanwhile, the US president also said on Monday he was considering taking a further $3bn of grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools.

Russia targets Ukraine with more drone strikes as Trump says Putin has ‘gone crazy’

Moscow launched a third consecutive night of extensive drone strikes against Ukraine, killing at least six people, as Trump suggested the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, had “gone crazy”.

Overnight on Monday, Russia fired a record 355 Shahed drones as well as nine cruise missiles, in an escalating aerial campaign targeting Ukraine’s cities and communities.

The Kremlin sought to downplay Trump’s remarks, attributing them to “emotional overload”.

Here’s what Trump said on Truth Social: “Something has happened to [Putin]. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! … I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!”

Has Trump indeed always said that Putin wants all of Ukraine? No. The idea that Trump has long been troubled by Putin’s imperial ambitions is an absolutely warped version of the real history, writes Archie Bland.

Last Thing: ‘Like a face’ – discovery reinforces idea Neanderthals created art, say experts

A pebble found in Spain features what is thought to be the world’s oldest complete human fingerprint, made by a Neanderthal on what would appear to be the oldest piece of European portable art. Approximately 43,000 years old, the rock is thought to represent a face with the fingerprint as its nose, experts say. A journal article from a team of Spanish archaeologists, geologists and police forensic experts strengthens the idea Neanderthals were capable of artistic and symbolic creation.

From Belarus to biohazards: unions demand action at ILC,"27 May, 2025The 187 member states of the International Labour Organization meet every year in June at the International Labour Conference (ILC) in Geneva, Switzerland. This year’s ILC starts on 2 June and will address possible new international standards on the protection of workers against biological hazards in the working environment and decent work in the platform economy.

Every ILO member state can send a delegation to the ILC consisting of two government delegates, one worker delegate and one employer delegate. Each delegate has one vote in the Conference plenary. Delegations also include advisers but they do not have voting rights. International organizations, like IndustriALL Global Union, attend as observers.

Why is the ILC important for trade unions?

The International Labour Conference brings together workers, governments and employer representatives on an equal platform. Through the workers group, national and global trade unions can influence government and employers’ policies, for example in the drafting of Conventions, and also in the monitoring of their implementation in member states.

The Conference is also important to trade unions because:

It is a chance to hold governments to account for labour abuses in their countries.

It gives cases of labour rights abuses an international platform.

It can help to resolve violations by making recommendations for action to governments and through sanctioning technical assistance to member states.

IndustriALL is participating in this year’s discussion on possible international standards on the protection of workers against biological hazards, as well as the discussions on promoting the transition to formality for decent work. IndustriALL will also be part of the workers’ group led by the ITUC at the Standard-Setting Committee on Decent Work in the Platform Economy.

ILO urged to enforce Article 33 on Myanmar

Earlier this year, the ILO Governing Body drafted a decision on the restoration of democracy and respect for fundamental rights in Myanmar, recommending the ILC consider measures under article 33 of the ILO Constitution to secure compliance by Myanmar with the commission report. The grounds are the military junta’s failure to carry out the recommendations given after an ILO Commission of Inquiry found serious violations of Forced Labour and Freedom of Association protocols.

Invoking Article 33 has only happened twice before in the history of the ILO, the last time was over Belarus in 2023, underscoring the severity of Belarus's violations of workers' rights. Belarus has become one of the worst countries in the world for workers, where independent trade unions have been dismantled, labour rights criminalized and freedom of association completely suppressed, prompting urgent calls for international action and ILO intervention.

What is the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards (CAS)?

The CAS is an essential part of the ILO’s supervisory system in that it checks how ILO standards are being applied by member states. There is preliminary list of 40 cases, out of those cases, 24 will be selected for the CAS discussion. In addition there will be a special sitting by the CAS on Belarus on 7 June.

Together with affiliated unions present in Geneva during ILC, as well as other activists, the global unions are planning a number of demonstrations at the Broken Chair in front of the Palais des Nations. The Broken Chair symbolizes resistance to violence and serves as a meeting point for demonstrations in support of human and labour rights.",https://www.industriall-union.org/from-belarus-to-biohazards-unions-demand-action-at-ilc,World
Hamas agrees to US proposal on Gaza ceasefire,"CAIRO: Hamas has agreed to a proposal by US special envoy Steve Witkoff for a Gaza ceasefire, a Palestinian official close to the group told Reuters on Monday, paving the way for a possible end to the war with Israel.

The new proposal, which sees the release of ten hostages and 70 days of truce, was received by Hamas through mediators.

“The proposal includes the release of ten living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in two groups in return for a 70-day ceasefire and a partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip,” the source said.

The proposal also sees the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners by Israel, including hundreds serving lengthy prison terms.

There was no immediate comment from Israel.

On March 18, Israel effectively ended a January ceasefire agreement with Hamas and renewed its military campaign in Gaza. Hamas and allied factions began firing rockets and attacks two days later.

Hamas has said it is willing to free all remaining hostages seized by its gunmen in attacks on communities in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and agree to a permanent ceasefire if Israel pulls out completely from Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would only be willing to agree to a temporary ceasefire in return for the release of hostages, vowing that war can only end once Hamas is eradicated.",https://www.brecorder.com/news/40364831/hamas-agrees-to-us-proposal-on-gaza-ceasefire,World
