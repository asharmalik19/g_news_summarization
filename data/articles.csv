"iPhone 17 Lineup May Feature A19 Chip, 12GB RAM, New Camera","Apple is gearing up to introduce its next-generation iPhone 17 lineup in September, according to multiple reports citing industry sources and leaks. The launch is expected to include four distinct models: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and a new addition — the iPhone 17 Air.

For the first time, Apple may introduce the “Air” branding within its iPhone series, diverging from the usual naming structure. This new version is speculated to offer a redesigned body that may highlight a slimmer and lighter profile, aligning with Apple’s efforts to diversify product segmentation.

As reported by CNET, the upcoming iPhone 17 series could feature notable hardware upgrades, particularly in memory. The devices are rumored to incorporate 12GB RAM, a jump from the 8GB seen in the iPhone 16 range. This increase is likely aimed at supporting Apple’s growing focus on artificial intelligence and seamless performance integration through its Apple Intelligence platform.

Apple’s A19 chip is expected to power the standard iPhone 17 model, while the premium Pro and Pro Max editions may run on a more advanced A19 Pro variant. Built using an improved 3nm fabrication process, the A19 chip is designed to offer increased efficiency, enhanced speed, and better battery optimization when compared to its predecessor, the A18.

Significant upgrades are rumored for the front-facing camera. Leaks indicate Apple may replace the current 12MP selfie camera with a 24MP sensor. Additionally, the introduction of a mechanical aperture system is being speculated — a feature that could allow users to manually adjust light intake, commonly available in professional photography equipment.

Apple is expected to hold its annual product unveiling event in September, consistent with its historical pattern. Although an exact date is yet to be disclosed, all four variants — including the newly introduced Air model — are likely to be announced during this event.

Initial price estimates suggest the iPhone 17 base model could launch in India at approximately ₹89,900. The highest-end Pro Max version may carry a price tag close to Rs 1,64,900. In the U.S., the starting price for the standard model is expected to be around $899. Meanwhile, in Dubai, the base version could be available from AED 3,799.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/technology/gadjets/iphone-17-lineup-may-feature-a19-chip-12gb-ram-new-camera-1362637,Technology
"Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra unveiled with 14"" OLED display and Xring O1 chipset","Xiaomi just announced its largest tablet yet – it has a 14” 3:2 display and it is also the company’s first Ultra tablet. Another first is that it uses the Xring O1, a chipset that is designed in-house by Xiaomi and is shared with the Xiaomi 15S Pro.



Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra

Meet the Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra. It’s quite different from its siblings, the Xiaomi Pad 7 and Pad 7 Pro, which have 11.2” IPS LCDs. The Ultra has a 14” OLED panel that is twice as bright (1,600 nits, DC + PWM dimming). It renders 12-bit colors with HDR10+ and Dolby Vision support. It has a resolution of 3,200 x 2,136px and a refresh rate of 120Hz (vs. 144Hz on the two other models).

Above the OLED layer is Gorilla Glass 5. Optionally, this can have a nano-texture that reduces reflectivity. One not-so-great change is that the Ultra display has a notch. There’s a single 32MP camera on there (1/3.6” OV32D sensor). The rear camera has a 50MP sensor (1/2.76” JN1).

The tablet is powered by the Xring O1, which is fabbed on a second-generation 3nm node. It has a 10-core CPU with prime cores reaching 3.7GHz (compared to 3.9GHz for the 15S Pro phone). There’s also an ARM Immortalis-G925 (16-core) GPU and a 6-core NPU that can deliver 44 TOPS of AI compute.

There are three configurations available: 12GB/256G, 12GB/512GB and 16GB/1TB. These use LPDDR5T RAM and UFS 4.1 storage.

The Pad 7 Ultra is made of aluminum alloy with reinforcement ribs to keep it stiff. It’s slimmer than its siblings at 5.1mm (vs. 6.2mm), but weighs more at 609g (vs. 500g).

Inside is a 12,000mAh battery with 120W fast charging. The USB-C port offers USB 3.2 Gen 2 speeds (10Gbps). Other connectivity features include Wi-Fi 7 (be, 2.4GHz and 5GHz), Bluetooth 5.4, NFC and even an IR blaster, so that you can control things around the house. There’s a fingerprint reader built into the power button on the side. The top side is a magnetic attachment and charging point for the optional stylus.

Additionally, there is a magnesium alloy keyboard available if you want a more laptop-like experience. It has oversized key caps, 13 function keys (no numpad, though) and a pressure-sensitive touchpad (a first for Xiaomi).

Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra with the optional stylus and keyboard

The tablet runs Xiaomi’s HyperOS 2, which integrates well with the Apple ecosystem (e.g. it supports the Apple office document formats). And Xiaomi says that it is ready for PC-level of use as it is pre-loaded with an office suite of apps, a CAD app and more.

The tablet has four groups of speakers – bass + tweeter pairs for a total of 8 speakers – with large 16.5cc chambers and Dolby Atmos support.

The Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra is available for pre-order from the company’s online store in China. The base 12GB/256GB model is CNY 5,700, which converts to $790/€700/₹68,000. Note that the two larger capacities (12GB/512GB and 16GB/1TB) are available in a “soft light” version, which has that anti-reflective nano-texture that we mentioned above.

Azure Logic Apps Introduces 'Agent Loop' for Building AI Agents in Enterprise Workflows,"At the annual Build conference, Microsoft announced agent loop, a new capability within Azure Logic Apps that allows developers to build AI agents directly into their enterprise workflows.

Agent loop is a central component for AI Agent development within Logic Apps. It is a new action type integrating a chosen AI model (like Azure OpenAI), domain-specific tools (via Logic Apps connectors), and enterprise knowledge sources. With the component, developers can create various types of AI agents, including autonomous agents for tasks like loan approvals, conversational agents for customer support, and multi-agent systems for coordinated activities such as sales report generation.

(Source: Microsoft Tech community blog post)

Built upon the kernel object in the Semantic Kernel, the agent loop leverages an LLM to determine the necessary steps. At the same time, the Azure Logic Apps runtime handles the execution of these plans. This approach offers significant flexibility, allowing for the creation of both conversational and fully autonomous agents that can respond to real-time events via Logic Apps' extensive library of connectors.

Divya Swarnkar, a program manager at Microsoft, told InfoQ :

With over 1,400 connectors, Logic Apps is uniquely positioned to power AI Agents with rich context and seamless access to enterprise systems and APIs, enabling them to reason and act reliably.

Agent loop operates through an iterative ""Think, Act, and Learn cycle."" The AI agent reasons about its goal and context, takes action by invoking connectors, and then reflects on the results to adjust its plan if needed. Azure Logic Apps manages this cycle automatically.

Microsoft highlights several potential use cases for AI Agents built with agent loop, including:

Product Return Agent: Verifying order details, return eligibility, and processing refunds or requesting further information.

Loan Approval Agent: Evaluating credit scores, income, and risk profiles to auto-approve or route applications.

Recruiting Agent: Screening resumes, summarizing qualifications, and drafting personalized outreach.

Sales Report Generation Workflow: Utilizing multiple agents for drafting, reviewing, and publishing reports.

IT Operations Agent: Triaging alerts, checking changes, and resolving common issues or escalating when necessary.

Multi-Agent Retail Supply Chain Solution: Coordinating inventory and logistics agents for timely restocks and optimized fulfillment.

Furthermore, the key benefits of building AI Agents in Logic Apps with agent loop include declarative orchestration, code extensibility, access to a vast library of integrated tools, observability with full traceability of agent decisions, enterprise-grade governance inheriting the security and compliance of Azure Logic Apps, straightforward human-in-the-loop and multi-agent coordination, and faster time to value by abstracting away the boilerplate of agent architecture.

Kent Weare, a Principal Program Manager for Logic Apps at Microsoft, states:

Building agents or workflows isn’t a binary choice. The most effective solutions often combine both — and that’s where Logic Apps excels. With Agent Loop, customers have full control to dial up the level of agentic automation that fits their needs. Logic Apps is where traditional workflows and AI agents come together, combining forces to solve complex business problems — all within a trusted, enterprise-grade platform. I don’t think any other platform offers this!

In addition, further emphasizing the potential, Cameron McKay, an Azure Application Architect, concluded in a LinkedIn blog post about the agent loop feature in Logic Apps:

This functionality has a lot of potential, and the number of use cases is up to the business and implementer; a few use cases include responding to error events and performing processes based on conversations with humans. I'm excited to see how the use cases for this functionality evolve; without a doubt, this is a highly transformative and useful piece of functionality being added to the Azure Logic Apps toolkit.

Agent loop is available in Azure Logic Apps Standard, and the company has provided documentation and demos to help developers get started. It has also outlined future plans for multi-agent hand-off support, A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol support, and OBO Auth for Logic Apps Agents.",https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/05/azure-logic-apps-agent-loop/,Technology
Google Launches SynthID Detector to Spot AI-Generated Content,"In this world of AI, people are using it literally for everything. Especially after the introduction of ChatGPT and Gemini, they are helping people in every possible way. Users are using them to generate text, audio or video. But these platforms have also been used to spread false information. To combat such issues, Google has come up with a solution. Google has introduced a new tool called SynthID Detector. It helps identify content made using Google’s AI tools. This includes images, videos, audio, and text. As AI becomes more powerful, tools like this are important to check what’s real and what’s AI-made.

Google Launches SynthID Detector to Spot AI-Generated Content

SynthID is Google’s watermarking technology. It adds invisible marks to AI-generated content. Detection tools can detect these marks, even though you can’t see them. They stay even when the content is shared, edited, or compressed. The goal is to help prevent fake content and misinformation.

At first, SynthID worked only for images. Now, it supports AI-generated text, audio, and videos too. Content made by Google’s Gemini, Imagen, Lyria, and Veo models can all be watermarked with SynthID. So far, over 10 billion items have been marked.

How Does the Detector Work?

The SynthID Detector is easy to use. You upload an image, video, audio, or text created by Google’s AI. The tool scans it for a watermark. If one is found, it highlights the parts that were likely marked.

For audio, it points out exact segments with watermarks. For images, it shows the areas that are most likely marked. This gives users a clear idea of what parts of the content are AI-generated.

Who Can Use It?

Right now, SynthID Detector is available to early testers. Journalists, researchers, and media workers can sign up on a waitlist to get access. Google also plans to make it widely available soon.

Growing the SynthID Ecosystem

To help more developers, Google has open-sourced SynthID’s text watermarking. This means anyone can use it in their own AI models. It’s a step toward building a more trustworthy digital space.

Google is also working with partners. One example is NVIDIA. Videos made using NVIDIA’s Cosmos AI tools now include SynthID watermarks. This spreads SynthID use beyond just Google.

Google has also partnered with GetReal Security, a global leader in content verification. This will also help others detect SynthID watermarks, too. It supports a shared effort for better content transparency.

Why It Matters

As AI-generated content becomes common, trust is key. People need ways to know what is real. Tools like SynthID Detector make that possible. Google also believes in working with others to make AI more transparent and safe.

How You’re Self-Sabotaging Your Screen Time Limits,"By India McCarty

Looking to cut down on your TikTok usage? A new study says your efforts to stop using the app might lead to more time than ever online.

“Our research was the first to document a novel phenomenon which we termed the ‘digital detox paradox,’” Christopher Newman, an associate professor of marketing and the King Self Chair of Free Enterprise in the Ole Miss School of Business Administration, explained.

The study looked at whether or not TikTok users would respond to built-in reminders to leave the app, or adhere to time limits on TikTok.

“Findings showed that digital detox intervention efforts from TikTok ironically led its users who were less skeptical of advertising to open TikTok more and use it longer,” Newman explained. “These less skeptical users viewed TikTok as more authentic when it voluntarily offered detox interventions, and in turn, responded positively to TikTok by paradoxically using its app more.”

He added that his research is “particularly timely” as lawmakers around the world are working to curb social media usage, especially in young people.

“We identified a vulnerable consumer segment — less skeptical consumers — that policymakers and non-governmental organizations should acknowledge when crafting initiatives aimed at regulating social media usage,” Newman said. “On the other hand, policymakers need to also be aware that higher levels of skepticism can be a hindrance to the efficacy of digital detoxing efforts.”

These findings aren’t all that surprising. Currently, TikTok is being sued by over a dozen states for specifically creating their app to be addictive to young people.

“It is profiting off the fact that it’s addicting young people to its platform,” District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb explained, via PBS.

Schwalb acknowledged that keeping users hooked is “how they generate massive ad revenue,” but added, “Unfortunately, that’s also how they generate adverse mental health impacts on the users.”

Newman’s research also reinforces other experts’ opinions on digital detoxes.

“Technology is very much a part of us now. We bank with an app, read restaurant menus on phones and even sweat with exercise instructors through a screen,” Emily Cherkin, a screen-time management consultant, told the BBC. “It’s so embedded in our lives, we’re setting ourselves up for failure if we say we’re going to go phone-free for a week.”

Sina Joneidy, a senior lecturer in digital enterprise at Teesside University, UK, recommended using technology in a “purposeful” way — instead of focusing on cutting screens out completely, concentrate on being intentional with your tech use.

Digitally detoxing can be hard, especially when it’s from an app as addictive as TikTok is, so if you’re struggling to cut down on screen time, don’t worry — you’re not alone.

Rockstar Quietly Raises Prices of RDR Games in Select Regions,"Rockstar Games has quietly raised the digital prices of Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2 in multiple countries. These include the UK, Brazil, Chile, and the Czech Republic. The price hikes started as early as April. Many fans were shocked, especially since these games are several years old.







Rockstar Price Hikes Frustrate Players

In the UK, the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption got a £10 bump. It now sells for £49.99. Red Dead Redemption 2 went up by £5 and costs £59.99. The bundle that includes both games rose by £15, reaching £99.99. Similar changes hit the Xbox Store in the same regions. However, prices in the US and most of Europe remain unchanged.

In Pakistan, Red Dead Redemption 2 jumped from PKR 4,000 to PKR 5,800. Gamers there were quick to react. Many criticized the loss of regional pricing and pointed out how the new rates ignore local income levels. Similar complaints came from players in Southeast Asia and South America. They saw no added content, just higher prices.

Fans Suspect a Bigger Plan

Rockstar hasn’t offered any official explanation. Still, many believe the company is testing pricing waters. This could be ahead of a next-gen update or even the release of Grand Theft Auto VI. The silent rollout of these changes only adds fuel to the speculation.







Despite price hikes, rumors of a next-gen patch for Red Dead Redemption 2 continue to swirl. Combined with growing hype for GTA VI, fans think Rockstar may be laying the groundwork for even higher prices down the road.

Deep Discounts Make Changes Confusing

Just weeks before the hikes, Red Dead Redemption 2 hit its lowest price ever on Steam as it was discounted by 75%, selling for just $14.99. That sale brought in a wave of new players and renewed interest in the game.

Now, with prices soaring again, many are left confused. The swing from a huge discount to a steep hike feels inconsistent. It’s left fans wondering what Rockstar’s pricing strategy really is.

For now, players around the world are watching closely. These quiet price increases highlight how unpredictable digital game pricing has become.",https://www.techjuice.pk/rockstar-quietly-raises-prices-of-rdr-games-in-select-regions/,Technology

Huawei allegedly testing 200MP periscope camera for future flagship smartphones,"A new leak shared by a tipster on Weibo suggests that Huawei is testing a 200MP periscope camera for its next-gen flagship smartphones. If not right away, we could find this advanced lens upgrade with the top-end Mate 80 series.

DigitalChatStation suggests that certain phone makers are evaluating a 200MP periscope telephoto camera. While the tipster didn’t reveal the names of the brands, it seems Huawei is also on the list of testing a big lens for its devices.

The 200MP periscope camera can offer significant benefits over an ordinary sensor. It enhances the zoom capability and image quality and enables users to capture distant subjects with impressive clarity and detail.

It can achieve 3x to 10x optical zoom, offering sharper and more detailed images at longer focal lengths. One can shoot close-up portraits or distant landscapes with this lens.

Huawei Pura 80 Ultra is expected to feature a 10x optical zoom camera, just like the P40 Pro+. Although if the company has just started testing a new lens, it won’t debut as early as the Pura 80 series, scheduled for a June launch.

Thus, if the current leak is accurate, the company may integrate a 200MP periscope telephoto camera into the Mate 80 series. The tipster adds that the camera will only appear with the high-end variant, as the Pro models can have a small screen.

It is unclear if Huawei has planned a big 200MP camera upgrade for its smartphones. Many phones like Xiaomi 15 Ultra are Vivo X200 Pro are using a 200MP camera sensor. Hence, the company may not want to feel left out in this trend.

But Huawei hasn’t confirmed these details yet. Therefore, we have to wait for some more revelations to clear the mist from the topic.",https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-allegedly-testing-200mp-periscope-camera-for-future-flagship-smartphones/,Technology
Alcatel V3 Classic and V3 Pro are also coming,"Alcatel is launching the V3 Ultra on May 27, and today we learned the event will see two more phones. The Ultra will share the stage with V3 Classic and V3 Pro – two 5G-enabled phones with 50 MP cameras and 5,200 mAh batteries.

The Ultra will be a rebadged TCL 50 Pro NxtPaper, and the other two are also part of the TCL portfolio – the Classic is the TCL 60, and the Pro is the TCL 60 SE NxtPaper.

Alcatel V3 Classic

Alcatel advertises the V3 Classic as ""India's First NxtVision Display,"" which is how TCL and Alcatel brand their regular screens. The NxtPaper technology will appear on the V3 Pro, a 6.7"" LCD with up to a 120 Hz refresh rate.

The e-ink tech is the only major difference between the V3 Classic and V3 Pro - these phones will share the same 50 MP + 5 MP camera combo on the back and 8 MP selfie shooter, as well as the battery we already mentioned.

Alcatel V3 Pro

We should point out that while TCL 60 launched with 256 GB storage, it seems like V3 Classic will be a 128 GB device (expandable with a micro SD slot). We also know the V3 Pro will bring 8 GB RAM, but the storage remains unknown here.

These phones should be fairly affordable - the TCL 60 SE NxtPaper launched internationally for €189, which is about INR18,000. We have to wait until Tuesday to learn how Alcatel will adapt the prices for the Indian market.

""The attack exploits the delegated Managed Service Account (dMSA) feature that was introduced in Windows Server 2025, works with the default configuration, and is trivial to implement,"" Akamai security researcher Yuval Gordon said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

""This issue likely affects most organizations that rely on AD. In 91% of the environments we examined, we found users outside the domain admins group that had the required permissions to perform this attack.""

What makes the attack pathway notable is that it leverages a new feature called Delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSA) that allows migration from an existing legacy service account. It was introduced in Windows Server 2025 as a mitigation to Kerberoasting attacks.

The attack technique has been codenamed BadSuccessor by the web infrastructure and security company.

""dMSA allows users to create them as a standalone account, or to replace an existing standard service account,"" Microsoft notes in its documentation. ""When a dMSA supersedes an existing account, authentication to that existing account using its password is blocked.""

""The request is redirected to the Local Security Authority (LSA) to authenticate using dMSA, which has access to everything the previous account could access in AD. During migration, dMSA automatically learns the devices on which the service account is to be used which is then used to move from all existing service accounts.""

The problem identified by Akamai is that during the dMSA Kerberos authentication phase, the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) embedded into a ticket-granting ticket (i.e., credentials used to verify identity) issued by a key distribution center (KDC) includes both the dMSAs security identifier (SID) as well as the SIDs of the superseded service account and of all its associated groups.

This permissions transfer between accounts could open the door to a potential privilege escalation scenario by simulating the dMSA migration process to compromise any user, including domain administrators, and gain similar privileges, effectively breaching the entire domain even if an organization's Windows Server 2025 domain isn't using dMSAs at all.

""One interesting fact about this 'simulated migration' technique, is that it doesn't require any permissions over the superseded account,"" Gordon said. ""The only requirement is to write permissions over the attributes of a dMSA. Any dMSA.""

""Once we've marked a dMSA as preceded by a user, the KDC automatically assumes a legitimate migration took place and happily grants our dMSA every single permission that the original user had, as though we are its rightful successor.""

Akamai said it reported the findings to Microsoft on April 1, 2025, following which the tech giant classified the issue as moderate in severity and that it does not meet the bar for immediate servicing due to the fact that successful exploitation requires an attacker to have specific permissions on the dMSA object, which suggests an elevation of privileges. However, a patch is currently in the works.

Given that there is no immediate fix for the attack, organizations are advised to limit the ability to create dMSAs and harden permissions wherever possible. Akamai has also released a PowerShell script that can enumerate all non-default principals who can create dMSAs and list the organizational units (OUs) in which each principal has this permission.

""This vulnerability introduces a previously unknown and high-impact abuse path that makes it possible for any user with CreateChild permissions on an OU to compromise any user in the domain and gain similar power to the Replicating Directory Changes privilege used to perform DCSync attacks,"" Gordon said.",https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/critical-windows-server-2025-dmsa.html,Technology
Signal signals discontent with Microsoft Recall,"Chat app biz Signal is unhappy with the current version of Microsoft Recall and has invoked some Digital Rights Management (DRM) functionality in Windows to stop the tool from snapshotting private conversations.

Recall, which is not enabled by default, lacks granularity in how it captures its screenshots. While it will ignore incognito-mode browser windows, everything else is fair game. Signal prides itself on chat privacy and sees automatic screenshot capture of message windows as unacceptable.

In the absence of settings that developers can use to curb Microsoft's eye on the desktop, Signal has turned to DRM. Setting a DRM flag on an application window means Recall (and any other screenshotter) will ignore it.

Signal explained: ""Apps like Signal have essentially no control over what content Recall is able to capture, and implementing 'DRM' that works for you (not against you) is the best choice that we had. It's like a scene in a movie where the villain has switched sides, and you can't screenshot this one by default either.""

The new ""Screen security"" setting is on by default in Signal Desktop on Windows 11. Turning it off prompts a warning and requires user confirmation to continue.

It is a blunt tool, but difficult to avoid. As Signal observed, there are legitimate reasons for wanting a screenshot. For example, accessibility software like screen readers or magnification tools may not function correctly otherwise. It also only applies to the local device.

Recall made a disastrous debut a year ago at Microsoft's 2024 Build event. Designed to capture snapshots to allow users to step back to whatever they might have been working on, it seemed a good idea, but the implementation resembled a prototype that somehow made it out into the wider world.

Cybersecurity experts and privacy activists tore Recall to shreds, and Microsoft was forced to go away and think about what it had done rework the tool.

In April 2025, Recall turned up in the Windows Insider Release Preview channel following a tentative preview of a reworked version at the end of 2024. The feature is opt-in and still carries the ""Preview"" label at the time of writing. According to Microsoft: ""You are always in control of what apps and websites get saved in snapshots.""

Signal, however, has a drier take on Recall. ""'Take a screenshot every few seconds' legitimately sounds like a suggestion from a low-parameter LLM that was given a prompt like 'How do I add an arbitrary AI feature to my operating system as quickly as possible in order to make investors happy?'"" ®",https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/22/signal_microsoft_recall/,Technology

Defect Size Dependent Reconstruction Strategy of the Nasal Tip Cutaneo,"Introduction

Nose locates at the central part of the mid-face and plays an important role in functional and aesthetical aspects, including nasal respiration, olfaction, and phonation. The sun-exposure makes the nose one of the most common sites for the presentation of cutaneous cancer on the face. The nasal surface is made up of several concave and convex subunits—dorsum and paired sidewalls, nasal tip and paired alae, columella, and paired soft tissue facets. And the different skin texture of these subunits makes the repair of nasal defect more challenging than other areas. Specifically, the skin of the nasal tip and alae is thicker, more sebaceous, and less flexible, than the dorsum, columella, and sidewalls.1 Any small alterations in skin color or texture caused by surgery are obvious and may lead to suboptimal results.

Restoring the 3-dimensional original shape, symmetry establishment, and color and texture match to the adjacent structures are the goal of nasal defect reconstruction. There have been many flaps designed to repair nose skin defect, and the most ideal procedure is repairing based on the nasal subunits. Goldman and Wollina1 used nasolabial banner flaps to reconstruct alar, sidewall, and columnar nasal defects, bilobed flap to repair sidewall defects, and Rintala flap to reconstruct nasal dorsum and nasal tip defects. Other flaps include tunneled island flap and frontal flap have also been reported. This article describes an alternative method of repair for nasal tip defects using one-stage flaps depending on the size of the original skin defect.

Patients and Methods

Data Collection

Patients admitted to the Department of Plastic Surgery, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China, between January 2010 and January 2024 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were all diagnosed with various nasal tumor and accept surgical removal and reconstruction. The exclusion criteria consisted of two specific clinical situations: defects smaller than 0.5 cm that could be closed primarily, and lesions larger than 2.5 cm with significant tissue loss that could not be effectively reconstructed with a single flap which requiring a multi-flap approach. Intraoperative and postoperative photographs included in this study were taken with patients’ consent. A standardized data collection template was used to collect variables including patient demographics, type of tumor, defect sizes, anatomic location and complications were collected. Descriptive analyses were performed, and the results are presented as the mean ± SD. The Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, granted approval for this study.

Tumor Resection and Flap Design

In our study, local infiltration anesthesia was administered to all patients. Specifically, lidocaine or ropivacaine with epinephrine were injected in the subfascial (SMAS) plane of the donor area for local anesthesia and preventing massive bleeding during surgery. Regarding tumor margin management, intraoperative frozen section pathology was routinely performed to evaluate tumor infiltration in both peripheral and basal surgical margins. For benign lesions, margin-controlled resection is performed. In the case of malignant mass, confirmed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) required 5 mm extended resection margins, while squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) necessitated 5–8 mm radical resection margins to achieve R0 clearance. Medical-grade drainage rubber sheets were placed in the subcutaneous tissue during wound closure and removed 5–7 days postoperatively if there are no complications such as infection or hematoma with minimal wound exudate.

For defects smaller than 1 cm, a horn-shaped flap was designed. The horn flap is a randomized local triangle flap with a straightforward design and a consistent blood supply which is based on a musculocutaneous flap. It is a dependable and adaptable flap for reconstructing the lateral and superior nasal tips, so it is utilized to repair minor regions of skin damage in our study. For the design of the flap, each incision was at the tangential position of the primary defect. The diameter of the lateral and medial curved incision is about 3 and 2 times of the defect diameter, respectively. The incisions were made, and the subcutaneous pedicle skin flap were transposed to cover the primary skin defect (Figure 1A–C).

(B) Intraoperative photograph of the wound after the removal of a tumor, with the markings of the flap. The defect area measuring 1.0×1.0 cm. (C) Immediate postoperative photograph demonstrating soft tissue coverage of the wound with horn-shaped flap. (D) Follow-up after three months demonstrating successful wound closure with ideal esthetic result. The front view (E) and right profile (F) taken 11 months after surgery.

For defects with a diameter of 1–2 cm, the bilobed flap was used. The design of the bilobed flap is described as follows. The flap is divided into two lobes, the first lobe is on the tangential position of the circular primary defect, and the second lobe is perpendicular to the first lobe and about half the size of the first lobe. The width of the first lobe should be equal to or slight larger than the width of the primary defect to avoid upward displacement of the nasal ala, and the length should be about one-third longer than the primary defect. The second lobe is to minimize tension when closing the secondary defect, and its size is variable. The distal end of the second lobe is designed to be 30 degrees sharp to facilitate the direct closure of the secondary defect after flap transposition (Figure 2A and B).

The defect area measuring 2.0×2.0 cm. (B) Immediate postoperative photograph demonstrating soft tissue coverage of the wound with bilobed flap. (C) Flap was well-survived five days after surgery. (D) Ten days after surgery and the sutures can be removed. The front view (E), the right profile (F and G), and the head tilted back view (H) taken 1 months after surgery.

For defects larger than 2 cm, frontonasal flap was applied. This flap is based on the branches of the angular artery and was designed at the area between dorsum and glabella. The incision between the eyebrow was designed to be inverted V-shaped, and the incision lines were designed at the naso-facial junction on both sides and naturally and smoothly transit to the defect. The tissue is dissected in the subcutaneous layer, and the flap is rotated and transferred to the defect. On the same side of the vascular pedicle, part of the skin tissue needs to be excised to avoid dog ear deformity. The secondary glabellar defect was sutured by V-Y plasty, and all wound edges were sutured without tension (Figure 3A–D).

(E and F) Follow-up after 2 months demonstrating successful wound closure without distortion of nose tip. The front view (G) and left profile (H) taken 5 months after surgery.

Straticulate interrupted sutures were applied in all cases to carefully close the wound. Antibiotics should be administrated in the first 3–5 days after surgery to avoid infections from nasal mucosal lining, nasopharynx, or oropharynx. In some cases, negative pressure wound therapy was applied to assist wound healing and removed after 3–5 days. Patients were advised to keep the head elevated in the first few days after surgery to reduce edema, and any abnormal swelling or hematoma should be promptly treated to avoid flap necrosis.

Results

The prerequisite for stage-one defect closure after malignant tumor resection is a complete R0 resection of the tumor, which was accomplished in all our patients. A total of 28 patients with an average age of 63.4 years (range 5–85 years, standard deviation 19.7 years) were included. Fifteen (75%) patients were male and 13 (25%) were female. No patients were excluded based on age, demographics, or comorbidities.

All lesions in the nasal tips were sent for pathological analysis. BCC was diagnosed in 12 patients and SCC in 3 patients. R0 resection was achieved in all malignant tumors. The other lesions included were seborrheic keratosis (3 cases), verruca vulgaris (1 case), nevi (5 cases), trichoblastoma (1 case), keratoacanthoma (1 case), pleomorphic adenoma (1 case), and hamartomatoid lesions (1 case). A horn-shaped flap was the reconstructive option in 5 subjects, a bilobed flap was used in 11 patients, and frontonasal flap was used in 12 cases (Table 1).

Table 1 Patient Characteristics

All patients achieved primary healing. No severe complications like wound dehiscence, congestion, postoperative hematomas or major necrosis occurred, and all the flaps survived completely. Slight edema occurred in 5 patients, and slight infection occurred in 2 patients, manifesting as peri-incisional erythema with increased exudate. Given the negative bacterial culture results, sterile dressing changes were conducted twice a day, which led to complete wound healing in several days (Table 2). Moreover, there was no distortion of the nasal tip or alar rim. The postoperative healing process of the patients was generally favorable and well-tolerated (Figures 1D–F, 2C–F, 3E–H). During the follow-up period of 3–11 months, no tumor recurrence was observed.

Discussion

Successful nasal skin defect reconstruction after complete tumor excision requires surgeons to master different surgical techniques to tailor the procedures based on tumor localization, size, and depth, and patients’ needs. Although single-stage flaps combined with grafts in facial defect repair may be easier and less time consuming, they can also lead to a poor cosmetic outcome. Burget and Menick improved nasal reconstruction techniques by establishing the aesthetic subunit principle.2 The reconstruction should follow the principles of cosmetic subunit repair. Specifically, Burget suggested that entire subunit reconstruction should be conducted if the defect is larger than 50% of the subunit. Multiple approaches has been reported in nasal repair, which including mucosal flaps, skin grafting, local flap, forehead flap, and free tissue transfer.3 Until now, various flaps have been applied depending on the size of the defect, skin quality, functionality and aesthetics, and the patient’s requirements.

The limited tissue mobility and lack of adequate tissue reservoir make simple linear closure on the nose difficult in most cases. Studies reported that for small skin defects, the dorsum defects can choose full thickness skin grafting (FTSG) and primary closure, rotation and cheek advancement flaps, and FTSG are options for the sidewall defects, and nasal tip defects can be repaired by advancement or rotation flaps, island pedicle flaps, and FTSG. The forehead flap is preferred for defects larger than 3 cm in these areas, and nasal ala reconstruction requires composite grafts or a forehead flap with a cartilage graft. To repair superficial defects of all subunits, healing by secondary intention is an option.4 Despite the advantage of reduced incision on nose, the FTSG can cause secondary damage to the donor site and involves prolonged wound care. However, FTSG should be considered in repairing defects in the thin skin of dorsum and sidewalls, or in patients with superficial defects, patients who refused multi-staged procedure or multiple flap harvest, and patients with severe medical comorbidities.

A study conducted by Park et al5 revealed that the most commonly used surgical technique for nasal ala reconstruction was the nasolabial flap, whereas for the nasal tip bilobed flaps were preferred. However, nasolabial flap has the risk of different color and texture, and blunting of nasal facial sulcus and alar groove.6 The application of bilobed or trilobed transposition flaps allow for the transposition of more mobile skin to reconstruct defects on the thick immobile skin of the nose tip. It is a single-stage procedure with a result of exceptional color and texture match but is often restricted to defects less than 1.5 cm diameter. However, some complications of bilobed flap including pincushioning, alar displacement and airflow obstruction have been reported due to individual suboptimal flap design and execution.7 Correa et al8 demonstrated that the paramedian forehead flap is an ideal choice and should be the gold standard for whole nasal reconstruction.

Some studies reported modified flaps for nasal repair. Zeikus et al6 designed a variation of an advancement flap for the reconstruction of partial thickness defects less than 1 cm on the nasal ala and lateral nasal tip. This flap can be laterally, medially, or bilaterally based, with sharply undermining with a scalpel blade in the subcutaneous plane (on the ala) or just above perichondrium (on the lateral tip). Hafiji et al9 reported a nasal sidewall (AIRNS) flap for reconstruction of the distal nose. It may be a possible alternative to the bilobed flap. But the application of AIRNS flap in the laterally based defects of the nasal alar may cause the blunting of the superior alar crease, which can be avoided by using the bilobed flap. Staged interpolation flaps or skin grafting are recommended for larger defects, in combination with autologous cartilage grafting if necessary.8,10

Furthermore, the Rintala flap, a rectangular flap made from the glabellar and nasal dorsum areas, is an additional alternative for correcting the nasal deformity. The flap maintains face symmetry since it runs along the midline. However, it would result in inadequate supply of blood surrounding the flap because this is a narrow pedicle flap. It is advised that the flap extend from the glabella to the middle part of the nasal dorsum to prevent necrosis.11,12 Besides, it may cause bilateral scars, and the restricted width is not appropriate for defects involving adjacent subunits.

Management of nasal skin cancers requires an accurate assessment of the extent of tumor excision, functional preservation, and aesthetic outcomes of postoperative reconstruction. As a result, a multidisciplinary team effort is required to ensure that the surgical team precisely diagnoses tumor margins, chooses appropriate flap types, and conducts precise vascular anastomosis and tissue repair during the operation. Nasal tip and alar skin reconstruction is prone to aesthetic complications such as contour deformities of larger flaps and hypertrophic scars. The incidence of complications was 24% in patients with nasal defects greater than 1.5 cm and 4.8% in those with defects less than 1.5 cm. However, the complication rate increased to 32% for the patients who smoked.13 To avoid bulky flap, the flap should be precisely matched or thinned to the thickness of the defect, while the hemostatic and drainage procedure need be adequately followed as well.

In our study, we designed the reconstruction strategy regarding the size of defects. The horn flap, a curved V-Y advancement flap with forward displacement and rotation features, is a versatile and reliable reconstruction method for the reconstruction. However, due to the potential for dog ear deformity or flap distortion during flap advancement, the horn flap is often appropriate for the restoration of small defects.14 The bilobed flap demonstrates enhanced biomechanical efficacy through its dual-lobed configuration, achieving simultaneous optimization of wound closure geometry and greater tissue mobilization distances compared to single-lobed counterparts, so it is an ideal flap for small defects <1.5 cm in the distal third of the nose.15 Knackstedt et al16 retrospectively analyzed 111 cases of nasal tip defects repaired with bilobed flaps, and postoperative erythema occurred in 4.5% without any serious complications. The frontonasal flap relies on a narrow skin bridge and provides ample supply of blood. By advancing and rotating the flap, the tissue is transferred from the donor site (glabella and nasal dorsum) to the deficiency area (nasal tip and alar). The frontonasal flaps can repair larger defects than bilobed flaps and are typically used to treat medium-sized deformities in the tip or dorsum of the nose.17 Elderly patients are particularly well-suited for correcting nasal abnormalities with frontonasal flap because of their loose skin.18 Nevertheless, all the procedure should be based on the preoperative consent from patients after generalized information about the risks and potential side effects of the surgery. Moreover, multi-staged surgery should be avoided in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, and skin grafts are not recommended in patients who are active smokers or have only recently quit. The strategy reported in this article is a one-staged procedure with excellent color and texture match. The surgical incisions will fade with time and are usually not noticeable to others. It can maintain the contour of the nasal tip or alar rim without blunting of the nasofacial sulcus.

The limitations of our study are listed as follows. Since this is a retrospective study, the height and width of the patients’ noses cannot be measured, and the scar formation rate is not available. The strategy cannot be applied in patients with little tissue mobility or defects larger than 2 cm. FTSG or divisional reconstruction can be applied in those cases.

Conclusion

The face serves as both a central hub for diverse physiological functions and the primary area of human aesthetic expression. It becomes crucial to take into account both practical restoration and cosmetic results while restoring the face defect. This requires a thorough evaluation of the patient’s regional anatomy, biomechanical properties, and defect-specific characteristics, such as size, depth, location, and involvement of underlying tissues. Nasal defect reconstruction demands particular attention to its multi-subunit architecture, where flap design should adhere to subunit boundaries to optimize postoperative contour symmetry and functional unity. Furthermore, interpatient variability significantly influences reconstructive effectiveness, as individual differences in cutaneous texture, thickness, elasticity, and vascular integrity directly inform flap selection criteria and surgical success rates. Consequently, reconstruction techniques must be precisely adjusted using a comprehensive examination of patient-specific characteristics in order to reduce complication risks while attaining optimal functional and cosmetic outcomes. In summary, our strategy based on the size of defects demonstrates the versatility of local flaps for defect closure on the nose. The treatment can be tailored according to the size of the defect to achieve excellent aesthetic and functional results.",https://www.dovepress.com/defect-size-dependent-reconstruction-strategy-of-the-nasal-tip-cutaneo-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCID,Technology
New way to control magnetic whirls may power next-generation electronics,"JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Chinese researchers have discovered a new way to control tiny magnetic structures called skyrmions, which could help develop more efficient memory and sensing devices in future electronics, according to a statement issued by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HU) on Thursday.

The researchers, from HU, Tiangong University in Tianjin, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, published their findings in Nature Communications.

Skyrmions are tiny and stable magnetic structures that can exist in special materials and be manipulated with little energy, making them potential building blocks for future low-power electronic devices.

Using iron tin, known for maintaining stable skyrmions even at extreme temperatures, the scientists applied electric currents to make the skyrmions vibrate in specific patterns.

They observed two distinct vibration modes: a breathing motion similar to expanding and contracting lungs and a spinning motion. The patterns confirmed earlier theories that iron tin behaves differently from other magnetic materials.

Meanwhile, the team also found that when they applied a steady current, the resonance signals changed in a way that reveals the presence of special spin currents - flows of magnetic energy created by the movement of electrons' spins, rather than their electric charge.

Computer models showed it was caused by a special kind of force called damping-like torque. The force happens when many spinning electrons move together in the same direction.

The researcher said their findings offer a deeper understanding of how spin currents interact with magnetic materials and hold potential for developing low-power memory storage. Their method of using skyrmion vibrations could lead to highly sensitive magnetic sensors for medical imaging, quantum computing, and advanced electronics. ■",https://english.news.cn/20250522/9c08f248af9448e4956fd71444bdb598/c.html,Technology

Microsoft adds 50 classic retro games to Xbox Game Pass,"What's old is new again, in more ways than one.

Microsoft announced this week that Xbox Game Pass subscribers will get access to ""Retro Classics,"" an app they can download that contains more than 50 classic Activision titles from the 1980s and 90s. A brief glance at the list of games suggests it's pretty Atari 2600-heavy up front, from an era when games had amazing titles like Demon Attack and Megamania. However, there are some later releases, like the 1993 PC adventure game Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist, a game I included here strictly because of the title.

SEE ALSO: Handheld Xbox console images leak just weeks before Switch 2 launch

There is a massive catch to all of this, though: The games can only be played via cloud streaming, as far as I can tell from the FAQ page on the Xbox website. While that means they're accessible across different devices, it also means that you'll notice latency as you play them. These games were designed to play locally on a single machine years before people had home internet, so streaming them from a cloud is hardly ideal.

With that in mind, it's a little tough to take Microsoft's stated ""commitment to game preservation"" in the announcement blog post seriously. If these games only exist on a server farm somewhere and can't be purchased or stored locally, one could argue they aren't really being ""preserved."" And considering that Atari 2600 game cartridges had a mere 4KB of storage space on them, making people stream them instead of allowing for local downloads is a questionable use of internet bandwidth, to say the least.

Interestingly, this is also the second time Microsoft has tried this on Xbox. Some folks may remember Game Room, an Xbox 360 app where old games were sold individually and stored locally, as game streaming wasn't really a thing yet. Microsoft pulled the plug on Game Room very quickly. Hopefully Retro Classics gets better treatment than that.",https://mashable.com/article/xbox-game-pass-retro-classics,Technology
"Replacing Animal Products With Plant-Based Foods Leads to Weight Loss in People With Type 1 Diabetes, Finds New Research","WASHINGTON, D.C.—Replacing animal products with plant-based foods—even those defined as “unhealthy” by the plant-based diet index—is an effective strategy for weight loss in adults with type 1 diabetes, finds a new study by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine published in Frontiers in Nutrition. Participants following a vegan diet lost 11 pounds on average, compared to no significant weight loss for participants following a portion-controlled diet.

“Our research shows that replacing animal products with plant-based foods, even so-called ‘unhealthy’ ones,” benefits people with type 1 diabetes who are looking to lose weight,” says Hana Kahleova, MD, PhD, director of clinical research at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and lead author of the study. “Whether you have an orange and oatmeal for breakfast or orange juice and toasted white bread, either option is a better choice for weight loss than eggs and cottage cheese.”

The new research is a secondary analysis of a Physicians Committee study, which was the first randomized clinical trial to look at a vegan diet in people with type 1 diabetes. In the 12-week study, 58 adults with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a low-fat vegan group with no limits on calories or carbohydrates, or a portion-controlled group that reduced daily calorie intake for overweight participants and kept carbohydrate intake stable over time.

In this secondary analysis, participants’ dietary records were used to assess the relationship of a plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful PDI (hPDI), and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) with weight loss in adults with type 1 diabetes. “Healthful” plant-based foods, as defined by the PDI system, include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, oils, coffee, and tea. “Unhealthful” plant-based foods include fruit juice, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, and sweets. In each of the categories, a higher score indicates greater consumption of the plant-based foods in that category.

In the study, the overall PDI score increased on the vegan diet, and did not change on the portion-controlled diet; the hPDI score increased on both diets, more on the vegan diet; and uPDI increased on the vegan diet, and did not change on the portion-controlled diet.

Participants on the vegan diet significantly increased consumption of “healthful” plant foods including legumes, whole grains, and fruits, while consumption of vegetable oils and nuts significantly decreased; on the portion-controlled diet, participants increased their intake of whole grains. Consumption of “unhealthful” plant foods did not change significantly on either diet, except for reduced consumption of refined grains on the portion-controlled diet.

Participants on the vegan diet lost 5.2 kilograms (about 11 pounds) on average, which was associated with changes in PDI and hPDI scores, while there was no weight change for participants on the portion-controlled diet. Changes in uPDI did not result in changes in weight.

The original study found that a vegan diet also reduced insulin needs, improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, and led to improvements in cholesterol levels and kidney function in people with type 1 diabetes.",https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/replacing-animal-products-plant-based-foods-leads-weight-loss-people-type-1,Technology
"Quarter of a million cyberattacks lurk behind anime and Gen Z streaming trends, warns Kaspersky – Intelligent CISO","Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has issued a warning about a significant surge in cyberattacks cleverly disguised as popular anime series and other streaming content favoured by Generation Z.

A new report covering the period from the second quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025 uncovered over 250,000 instances of such attacks.

The report highlights how cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting the strong emotional connection that younger audiences have with shows like ‘Naruto’ and ‘Attack on Titan,’ as well as popular streaming platforms. This deep engagement creates a vulnerability, making users more susceptible to social engineering tactics.

To combat this growing threat and equip Gen Z with the necessary skills to identify and avoid these and other cyber risks, Kaspersky is launching ‘Case 404,’ an interactive cybersecurity game designed to educate young people on protecting their digital lives. The initiative aims to bridge the gap between Gen Z’s enthusiasm for online entertainment and their understanding of potential online dangers.

This is extremely evident in anime culture. Over 65% of Gen Z regularly watch anime, making them the most anime-engaged generation in history. According to the report, Kaspersky’s experts selected five popular anime titles among Gen Z: Naruto, One Piece, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan and Jujutsu Kaisen. Kaspersky found 251,931 attempts to deliver malware or unwanted files disguised under the names of these anime titles. Cybercriminals are tapping into the trust and affection Gen Z has for these series, often using bait like ‘exclusive episodes’, ‘leaked scenes’, or ‘premium access’.

Attempts to attack users through malicious or unwanted files disguised as Gen Z’s favorite anime throughout the reported period

Among anime titles, Naruto took the top spot, despite first airing more than two decades ago. Over the reported period, it was used as bait in 114,216 attempted attacks. Demon Slayer followed with 44,200 attack attempts. Its meteoric rise in recent years, amplified by viral moments and a growing global fanbase, made it a natural target for cybercriminals looking to ride the wave of hype. Meanwhile, Attack on Titan – a long-standing favourite – ranked third with 39,433 detected attempts to distribute malicious content.

Kaspersky also analyzed five iconic films and series that continue to resonate with Gen Z: Shrek, Stranger Things, Twilight, Inside Out 2, and Deadpool & Wolverine. These shows alone accounted for 43,302 attack attempts with a pronounced spike in attention to these titles from cybercriminals at the beginning of 2025. This is primarily connected to the rise of attacks on Shrek, with over 36,000 attempts in total and a sharp spike in March 2025, double the monthly average for 2024.

Attempts to attack users through malicious or unwanted files disguised as Gen Z’s favorite films and series throughout the reported period

Platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Apple TV Plus and HBO Max have reshaped movies, series and anime watching into an immersive, on-demand experience that caters to Gen Z’s love of personalised content and global storytelling. However, this has also created fertile ground for cybercriminals. Kaspersky detected 96,288 attempts to distribute malicious or unwanted files disguised as the names of these major streaming platforms. Unlike seasonal trends, streaming platforms offer a continuous flow of content, from highly anticipated premieres to hidden gems that viewers discover months or even years after release.

When examining which streaming services were most frequently used by cybercriminals, Netflix stood out by far, involved in 85,679 attack attempts and associated with over 2.8 million phishing pages imitating its branding. Cybercriminals take advantage of the constant traffic, broad global reach, and frequent subscription-based activity. They mimic login pages, share ‘free trial’ links, or spoof password reset emails with full knowledge of how central Netflix is to Gen Z’s digital routine.

As Gen Z’s daily life becomes inseparable from streaming platforms, fandom spaces, and social media communities, cyberthreats evolve to mirror their interests. To meet this challenge, Kaspersky has launched an interactive online game, ‘Case 404’, designed specifically for Gen Z. ‘Case 404’ invites players to become cyber-detectives and solve immersive cybercrime cases. Through this digital adventure, Kaspersky is not just highlighting risks but empowering Gen Z to develop their mindset and skillset to stay safe in an increasingly vulnerable online world. As a reward for completing the game, participants receive a discount on Kaspersky Premium, giving them trusted tools they need to navigate the digital world safely.

“As the world of entertainment continues to evolve, so do the tactics used by cybercriminals to exploit popular content, whether through fake downloads or fraudulent merchandise offers. From beloved anime like Naruto and Demon Slayer to the latest blockbusters like Inside Out 2, scammers have found new ways to take advantage of Gen Z’s affinity for digital culture and streaming platforms. With the rise of these cyberthreats, it’s more important than ever for young users to stay vigilant and understand how to protect themselves online,” said Vasily Kolesnikov, security expert at Kaspersky.

To watch favorite shows safely, Kaspersky recommends:

● Check out the interactive online game, ‘Case 404’ by Kaspersky, explicitly designed for Gen Z to learn how to stay safe in an increasingly vulnerable online world.

● Always use a legitimate, paid subscription when accessing streaming services and ensure you’re using apps from official marketplaces or the official websites.

● Always verify the authenticity of websites before entering any personal information. Stick to trusted, official pages when watching or downloading content and double-check URLs and company name spellings to avoid phishing sites.

● Be cautious about the file extensions you’re downloading. Video files should not have .exe or .msi extensions – these are typically associated with harmful programs.

● Use a reliable security solution to detect malicious attachments that could compromise your data.● Ensure secure browsing and safe messaging with protecting your IP address and preventing data leaks.",https://www.intelligentciso.com/2025/05/22/quarter-of-a-million-cyberattacks-lurk-behind-anime-and-gen-z-streaming-trends-warns-kaspersky/,Technology

Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 now 'confirmed' to mark the Exynos 2500's belated debut,"Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7 is expected to become official alongside the Fold7 in early July, and there has been some confusion regarding the chipset that will be powering it. Today, a new report claims to 'confirm' (as much as any rumor can) that Samsung's Exynos 2500 SoC will finally make its debut in the Galaxy Z Flip7.

The Exynos 2500 was destined for the Galaxy S25 family, but Samsung had to give up on it because of yield issues with production. That's why the Snapdragon 8 Elite is in there instead. But now, apparently those yield issues have been fixed, or with the Flip7's lower projected sales numbers, they don't matter.

Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6

That is, of course, if this rumor pans out. The source goes on to claim that the Exynos 2500 will be used in most countries, including India and Korea. It's the first time an Exynos features in a foldable Samsung device, so it's a pretty big deal. Samsung may allegedly use the Snapdragon 8 Elite in China and North America only.

The Exynos 2500 has a ten-core CPU with one Cortex-X925 cores clocked at up to 3.3 GHz, two Cortex-A725 cores clocked at up to 2.75 GHz, five Cortex-A725 cores clocked at up to 2.36 GHz, and two Cortex-A520 cores clocked at up to 1.8 GHz. The GPU is the Xclipse 950 based on AMD RDNA 3.5 architecture.

Using a fermionic neural network to find the ground state of fractional quantum Hall liquids,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

When two-dimensional electron systems are subjected to magnetic fields at low temperatures, they can exhibit interesting states of matter, such as fractional quantum Hall liquids. These are exotic states of matter characterized by fractionalized excitations and the emergence of interesting topological phenomena.

Researchers at Cavendish Laboratory and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) set out to better understand these fascinating states using machine learning, specifically employing a newly developed attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN).

The method they developed, outlined in a paper published in Physical Review Letters, was trained to find the lowest-energy quantum state (i.e., ground state) of fractional quantum Hall liquids.

""AI has transformed many areas of society and science, but we are yet to see an AI breakthrough in quantum physics,"" Liang Fu, co-author of the paper, told Phys.org.

""Solving quantum many-body problems is known to be extremely difficult, because a quantum system can be in a superposition of exponentially many states: literally, everything everywhere all at once! So, we wanted to find out whether AI has the power to conquer the quantum world.""

The main objective of the recent research by Fu and his colleagues was to assess the potential of advanced machine learning tools for solving complex quantum problems. Working towards this goal, the researchers developed a new FNN and tried to use it to uncover the hidden patterns of electrons in topological quantum liquids.

""Our recent paper was inspired by the rapid development of AI, in particular the FNN, to tackle quantum chemistry problems,"" said Yi Teng, co-author of the paper. ""We wanted to demonstrate that this neural network based variational approach can also be applied to complex condensed matter systems, proven challenging for traditional numerical methods.""

Fractional quantum Hall liquids are intricate states of matter known to emerge in 2D electron systems when a strong magnetic field is applied to them. The computational method developed by Fu, Teng and Dai can capture rich physical phenomena, successfully uncovering microscopic features of fermionic quantum Hall liquids and competing states.

""The fractional quantum Hall liquid hosts emergent particles—-neither bosons nor fermions—-that carry a quantized fraction of electron's charge,"" explained Fu. ""While great success in this venerable field came from the best human minds, there remain long-standing open questions that require numerically accurate solutions beyond the capability of traditional methods. So, we gave AI a shot.""

This study is among the first to demonstrate the potential of AI and machine learning for studying fractional phases of matter. Using their FNN, Fu, Teng and Dai generated a variational ansatz, which is a flexible mathematical structure that can be optimized to estimate a system's ground state.

""We then used Monte-Carlo sampling to minimize the total energy in search of ground state,"" said Teng. ""We also performed extensive benchmarks and found neural networks consistently outperform traditional methods. The biggest advantage of our method is that no human biases are put in by hand, and the neural network captures all possible states of electrons without truncating the Hilbert space.""

The team's demonstration highlights the promise of FNNs for the study and estimation of states that can be difficult to predict theoretically. As part of their study, the researchers successfully used their FNN to accurately predict the transition of a 2D electron system from liquid to crystal.

""We demonstrate that an unbiased neural network can be used to solve different phases (fractional quantum Hall liquid and Wigner crystal in our case) in a unified manner with unprecedented accuracy,"" said Teng. ""This shows the capacity and versality of the NN-based variational method in quantum condensed matter physics.""

In the future, the model developed by Fu, Teng and Dai could be improved further and used to predict the quantum phase diagram of various 2D electron systems. In addition, it could inspire the development of other FNN-based models for quantum research and could potentially contribute to the discovery of new quantum states of matter.

""For me, this project was a mind-blowing experience,"" said Fu. ""I am now fully convinced of the transformative power of AI for quantum science, offering a vast opportunity.

""Looking ahead, I also believe that solving challenging quantum problems provides an objective benchmark for different large language model architectures. Think of it: no training data is involved in such test, and the ranking is objectively determined by the variational energy. The best of all is the reward—AI solving the quantum phase diagram of real materials and discovering new quantum states of matter.""

As part of their future studies, the researchers plan to use their FNN-based method to study a wide range of other quantum systems. For instance, they would like to use it to gather new insights into non-Abelian states, unconventional superconductivity and quantum spin liquids.

""Going forward, I'm also excited to both use AI to solve challenging physics problems, and to use challenging physics problems to learn more about AI,"" added David Dai, co-author of the paper.

Gut bacteria and diet found to affect cancer treatment outcomes,"A Ludwig Cancer Research study has uncovered a surprising link between diet, intestinal microbes and the efficacy of cancer therapy.

Led by Ludwig Princeton's Asael Roichman and Branch Director Joshua Rabinowitz, the study could help explain why drugs known as PI3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors-which disrupt an abnormally activated biochemical signaling pathway that spurs cancer cell proliferation-haven't led to consistent, durable cancer control in patients with solid tumors.

Many cancer drugs don't work equally well for all patients, and one emerging possibility is that diet plays a role in this variability. We found in this study that diet can indeed alter cancer treatment outcomes in preclinical models and can do so in an unexpected way, unrelated to its immediate nutritional effects. It turns out that certain small molecules in plant-based foods are transformed in mice by commensal gut bacteria into compounds that activate the liver to clear PI3K inhibitors more quickly, lowering the efficacy of the drug."" Joshua Rabinowitz, Ludwig Princeton

""While we focused in this study on PI3K inhibitors, the liver enzymes involved in clearing these drugs break down many others as well,"" added Roichman, a postdoc in the Rabinowitz lab and lead author of the study. ""This suggests our findings could be of relevance to multiple classes of drugs used to treat cancer and other diseases.""

The study, reported in the current issue of Cell, began with a surprising result obtained from an experiment examining the interplay between diet and cancer therapy from an entirely different perspective.

The Rabinowitz lab and others have shown that ketogenic diets dramatically enhance responses to cancer drugs in preclinical mouse models of cancer. Such diets are rich in fat and very low in carbohydrates like starch and sugar, and their enhancement of therapeutic responses was thought to be linked to their tendency to lower insulin and blood sugar levels. The researchers were therefore surprised when mice fed certain high-carbohydrate diets-which should raise blood sugar and spike insulin production-responded well to PI3K inhibitors in their experiment.

Digging into this unexpected result, they found that the keto diet's enhancement of responses to PI3K inhibitors had little to do with carbs, fat, blood sugar or insulin. Rather, experiments revealed that the key determinant was the molecular complexity of the diet-whether it was made of 'whole foods' versus highly processed ones.

The ketogenic food consumed by mice in preclinical studies is a highly processed formulation lacking the complex mix of plant-derived chemicals (phytochemicals), especially from legumes and soy, that are present in standard chow. It turned out that gut microbes break down phytochemicals, namely soyasaponins derived from soybeans, into molecules that induce the expression of a detoxifying liver enzyme, cytochrome P450.

Experiments revealed that elevated production of these hepatic enzymes in the chow-fed mice led to rapid clearance of PI3K inhibitors, reducing the anti-cancer efficacy of the regimen. In line with these findings, the researchers demonstrated that a high-carbohydrate but low-phytochemical diet-as well as antibiotics that suppressed the gut microbiome-enhanced PI3K inhibitor activity in the mice.

""These findings suggest that some plant-based diets, through their interactions with gut microbes, may lower cancer drug exposure by ramping up the body's drug clearance systems,"" said Roichman. ""While the specific molecules that exert such an influence may differ in humans, our work highlights diet and the microbiome as key factors that can shape how cancer drugs behave in the body.""

Further, the findings open opportunities to develop new strategies for cancer therapy that take into account such factors as a patient's diet, microbiome composition and recent use of antibiotics, which alter the ecosystem of commensal bacteria. Informed by additional research, such strategies could include analyses of patient microbiomes and the prescription of dietary changes and pharmaceutical interventions to modulate the metabolism of cancer therapies.",https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250522/Gut-bacteria-and-diet-found-to-affect-cancer-treatment-outcomes.aspx,Technology
Mysterious Database of 184 Million Records Exposes Vast Array of Login Credentials,"The possibility that data could be inadvertently exposed in a misconfigured or otherwise unsecured database is a longtime privacy nightmare that has been difficult to fully address. But the new discovery of a massive trove of 184 million records—including Apple, Facebook, and Google logins and credentials for accounts connected to multiple governments—underscores the risks of recklessly compiling sensitive information in a repository that could become a single point of failure.

In early May, longtime data-breach hunter and security researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered an exposed Elastic database containing 184,162,718 records across more than 47 GB of data. Typically, Fowler says, he is able to gather clues about who controls an exposed database from its contents—details about the organization, data related to its customers or employees, or other indicators that suggest why the data is being collected. This database, however, didn’t include any clues about who owns the data or where it may have been gathered from.

The sheer range and massive scope of the login details, which include accounts connected to a large array of digital services, indicate that the data is some sort of compilation, possibly kept by researchers investigating a data breach or other cybercriminal activity or owned directly by attackers and stolen by infostealer malware.

“This is probably one of the weirdest ones I’ve found in many years,” Fowler says. “As far as the risk factor here, this is way bigger than most of the stuff I find, because this is direct access into individual accounts. This is a cybercriminal’s dream working list.”

Each record included an ID tag for the type of account, a URL for each website or service, and then usernames and plaintext passwords. Fowler notes that the password field was called “Senha,” the Portuguese word for password.

In a sample of 10,000 records analyzed by Fowler, there were 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. That sample—just a tiny fraction of the total exposure—also included Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, Twitter, WordPress, and Yahoo logins, among many others. A keyword search of the sample by Fowler returned 187 instances of the word “bank” and 57 of “wallet.”

Fowler, who did not download the data, says he contacted a sample of the exposed email addresses and heard back from some that they were genuine accounts.

Aside from individuals, the exposed data also presented potential national security risks, Fowler says. In the 10,000 sample records there were 220 email addresses with .gov domains. These were linked to at least 29 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom.

While Fowler could not identify who had put the database together or where the login details originally came from, he reported the data exposure to World Host Group, the hosting company it was linked to. Access to the database was quickly shut down, Fowler says, although World Host Group did not respond to the researcher until after it was contacted by WIRED.",https://www.wired.com/story/mysterious-database-logins-governments-social-media/,Technology

NordVPN rolls out post-quantum encryption to all applications,"LONDON, May 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NordVPN, a leading cybersecurity company, announces the launch of post-quantum encryption (PQE) support for all its VPN applications. The first iteration of post-quantum cryptography was implemented on the NordVPN Linux application last year. In 2025, NordVPN also rolled out its PQE feature for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, including Android TV and tvOS.

“As quantum computing advances, the traditional encryption methods used by most VPN protocols today will eventually become vulnerable. By integrating PQE into our VPN infrastructure, we're taking a proactive step to ensure long-term confidentiality and resilience for our customers' data, both now and in a post-quantum future,” says Marijus Briedis, CTO at NordVPN .

In September 2024, NordVPN released a Linux app update with the first post-quantum cryptography upgrade for the NordLynx protocol — a high-performance VPN protocol known for its extreme speed and security, based on WireGuard. The upgraded protocol complied with the latest National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for post-quantum encryption and protected Linux users from quantum decryption, while also collecting essential performance metrics, such as impact on connection speeds and latency.

“The gathered data served as a stepping stone in the transition to quantum-resistant encryption to the rest of our platforms,” says Briedis. “The Linux case demonstrated that we successfully maintained the highest level of user experience in terms of connection time and speed during the transition. As a result, other applications followed to ensure long-term data security for our users.”

PQE is enabled with a toggle switch — once turned on under “Connections” in “Settings,” the feature will automatically activate whenever the user connects via the NordLynx protocol.

ABOUT NORDVPN

PiLogic raises $4 million for bespoke satellite AI models,"TAMPA, Fla. — Californian software startup PiLogic announced $4 million in seed funding May 22 to develop satellite diagnostics and other artificial intelligence tools tailored for space applications.

The first satellite equipped with the venture’s electrical power system diagnostics model is slated to launch this year for an undisclosed customer, according to Johannes Waldstein, PiLogic’s founder and CEO.

The software would integrate onboard sensor data with detailed knowledge of engineering principles and the satellite’s parts, enabling the operator to predict component health and potentially resolve issues autonomously.

“It understands the cause and effect in a healthy system, and then it reasons to what’s broken or what’s wrong,” Waldstein said.

Validated with satellites on the ground through work with NASA, PiLogic’s “exact AI” model is designed to be faster and more accurate than restrictive rules-based systems and broader generative AI tools like ChatGPT that rely on large language models.

“You lose the satellite if [diagnosis] takes too long,” he added, “if you have to send information back down, and you have an operator trying to figure out … and then suddenly, either you lose contact, or it runs out of charge or doesn’t recharge.”

By running inference and remediation directly onboard, the AI gives operators a chance to prevent cascading failures.

“It will go to a backup battery or it will change sensors automatically,” Waldstein continued.

“And it will contact the operators saying: ‘I’ve done this, I think there’s a failure in this sensor, I think space debris has hit it, and now this portion of the satellite is not working — we should reroute around that.’”

The model is designed to run efficiently without massive datasets or graphics processing units (GPUs), requiring minimal onboard computing power. That makes it suitable even for even small cubesats, Waldstein said, although PiLogic sees most demand coming from customers with more complex, high-value spacecraft.

PiLogic has also developed an AI model that tracks and predicts objects in 3D space, designed to distinguish between entities such as airplanes and drones much faster than conventional methods.

Waldstein, a data science and AI innovator who has co-founded five startups over the past two decades, said PiLogic’s software is currently being tested by several large satellite operators and dual-use commercial/government companies.

Chatbot Helps Users Adopt a Low FODMAP Diet,"SAN DIEGO — Low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) dietary advice has been shown to be effective in easing bloating and abdominal pain, especially in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but limited availability of dietitians makes delivering this advice challenging. Researchers from Thailand have successfully enlisted a chatbot to help.

In a randomized controlled trial, they found that chatbot-assisted dietary advice with brief guidance effectively reduced high FODMAP intake, bloating severity, and improved dietary knowledge, particularly in patients with bothersome bloating.

“Chatbot-assisted dietary advice for FODMAPs restriction was feasible and applicable in patients with bloating symptoms that had baseline symptoms of moderate severity,” study chief Pochara Somvanapanich, with the Division of Gastroenterology, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, told Medscape Medical News.

Somvanapanich, who developed the chatbot algorithm, presented the study results at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

More Knowledge, Less Bloating

The trial enrolled 86 adults with disorders of gut-brain interaction experiencing bloating symptoms for more than 6 months and consuming more than seven high-FODMAPs items per week. Half of them had IBS.

At baseline, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the ability to identify FODMAPs were assessed. All participants received a 5-minute consultation on FODMAPs avoidance from a GI fellow and were randomly allocated (stratified by IBS diagnosis and education) into two groups.

The chatbot-assisted group received real-time dietary advice via a chatbot which helped them identify high, low, and non-FODMAP foods from a list of more than 300 ingredients/dishes of Thai and western cuisines.

The control group received only brief advice on high FODMAPs restriction. Both groups used a diary app to log food intake and postprandial symptoms. Baseline bloating, abdominal pain and global symptoms severity were similar between the two groups. Data on 64 participants (32 in each group) were analyzed.

After 4 weeks, significantly more people in the chatbot group than the control group responded — achieving a 30% or greater reduction in daily worst bloating, abdominal pain or global symptoms (19 [59%] vs 10 [31%], P < .05). Responder rates were similar in the IBS and non-IBS subgroups.

Subgroup analysis revealed significant differences between groups only for participants with bothersome bloating, not those with mild bloating severity.

In those with bothersome bloating severity, the chatbot group had a higher response rate (69.5% vs 36.3%) and fewer bloating symptoms (P < .05). They also had a greater reduction in high FODMAPs intake (10 vs 23 items/week) and demonstrated improved knowledge in identifying FODMAPs (P < .05).

“Responders in a chatbot group consistently engaged more with the app, performing significantly more weekly item searches than nonresponders (P < .05),” the authors noted in their conference abstract.

“Our next step is to develop the chatbot-assisted approach for the reintroduction and personalization phase based on messenger applications (including Facebook Messenger and other messaging platforms),” Somvanapanich told Medscape Medical News.

“Once we’ve gathered enough data to confirm these are working effectively, we definitely plan to create a one-stop service application for FODMAPs dietary advice,” Somvanapanich added.

Lack of Robust Data on Digital GI Health Apps

Commenting on this research for Medscape Medical News, Sidhartha R. Sinha, MD, Director of Digital Health and Innovation, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University in Stanford, California, noted that there is a “notable lack of robust data supporting digital health tools in gastroenterology. Despite hundreds of apps available, very few are supported by well-designed trials.”

“The study demonstrated that chatbot-assisted dietary advice significantly improved bloating symptoms, reduced intake of high-FODMAP foods, and enhanced patients’ dietary knowledge compared to brief dietary counseling alone, especially in those with bothersome symptoms,” said Sinha, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“Patients actively used the chatbot to manage their symptoms, achieving a higher response rate than those in the control arm who received brief counseling on avoiding high-FODMAP food,” he noted.

Sinha said in his practice at Stanford, “in the heart of Silicon Valley,” patients do use digital resources to manage their GI symptoms, including diseases like IBS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — and he believes this is “increasingly common nationally.”

“However, the need for evidence-based tools is critical and the lack here often prevents many practitioners from regularly recommending them to patients. This study aligns well with clinical practice, and supports the use of this particular app to improve IBS symptoms, particularly when access to dietitians is limited. These results support chatbot-assisted dietary management as a feasible, effective, and scalable approach to patient care,” Sinha told Medscape Medical News.

Seniors With Diabetes Benefit From Intermittent Scanning CGM,"TOPLINE:

The use of intermittent scanning continuous glucose monitoring (is-CGM) led to significant reductions in A1c levels among patients aged 60 years or older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with improvements visible after 3 months and persisting up to 24 months. The technology showed high acceptance among users, with only 2.8% discontinuing it due to device-related issues.

METHODOLOGY:

Although real-time CGM has shown effectiveness in improving glycaemic control and preventing hypoglycaemia in older adult patients, the efficacy of is-CGM remains understudied in this population.

Researchers in the Netherlands conducted a retrospective case-control study to compare reductions in A1c levels between patients aged 60 years or older with type 1 or insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes who used is-CGM and those who did not.

They selected 353 patients (median age, 67 years; 59.8% men) from an outpatient clinic in Groningen; those who used is-CGM (n = 142) were matched with control individuals (n = 211) who did not use is-CGM on the basis of age, sex, type of diabetes, and insulin treatment modality.

Data were collected at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months following the initiation of is-CGM, focusing on A1c levels and sensor usage.

The primary endpoint was the difference in A1c levels over time between is-CGM users and control individuals relative to their baseline values.

TAKEAWAY:

Median baseline A1c levels were 7.9% and 7.8% among is-CGM users and control individuals, respectively. After 3 months of initiating is-CGM, a significant reduction in A1c levels was observed among users compared with control individuals (unadjusted estimates, −0.5% vs −0.01%; P = .013), with reductions persisting throughout the study.

After accounting for potential confounders, initiating is-CGM led to persistent statistically significant reductions in A1c levels at 6 months (−0.46%; P = .006) and 24 months (−0.39%; P = .033).

Device acceptance was notably high, with only 2.8% of users discontinuing is-CGM due to device-related reasons. No cases of diabetes-related complications were seen in both the groups.

IN PRACTICE:

""Together with the minimal number of discontinuations due to device-related reasons, our findings argue for the use of this technology in the elderly (60+) population with DM [diabetes mellitus],"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Riemer A. Been, MD, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. It was published online on May 13, 2025, in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

LIMITATIONS:

The distribution of patients with type 1 diabetes was not evenly balanced between control and is-CGM groups. The study defined older adults as those aged 60 years or older, which may not have adequately reflected the diversity within this population, especially since those aged 80 years or older were underrepresented. The single-centre design at an academic hospital in the Netherlands may have limited the generalisability of the results to other regions.

One author reported receiving an unrestricted educational grant from the European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes mentorship programme supported by AstraZeneca. The remaining authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

"Frailty in the ICU: Many Definitions, No Easy Solutions","SAN FRANCISCO — Frailty is hard to define and hard to distinguish from the effects of illness, injury, and medical interventions, but the frailty of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) can have profound effects on outcomes, including the risk for mortality.

In a scientific symposium on frailty in the ICU, presented during the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2025 International Conference, researchers outlined both the challenges of assessing frailty in the ICU and the effects of frailty on patients in the ICU and after discharge.

“I think the ICU is a unique rubric to understand the role of frailty, stress, and maladaptive physiologic responses in mediating short- and long-term outcomes,” said Aluko Akini Hope, MD, from Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, Oregon.

Despite some unique challenges in the ICU setting, frailty can be measured using approaches that consider both frailty phenotype and cumulative deficits, Hope said.

He defined physical frailty as “a clinical state in which the patient has reduced functional reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors due to maladaptive changes across multiple physiologic systems.”

Although definitions and means of assessing frailty vary, they can be roughly grouped into two main conceptual models.

The phenotypic model relies on physical factors such as recent weight loss > 10 lbs, low grip strength, exhaustion, slow gait, and low physical activity.

The cumulative health deficit model can be summed up as “the more individuals have wrong, the more likely they are to be frail,” Hope said.

Multiple Assessment Tools

Frailty can be assessed with a variety of approaches, including the frailty index, which generates a score calculated by dividing the number of deficits a patient has by the total number of health variables considered. The assessment using this index can be reduced to approximately 30 items with good predictive validity, Hope said.

The predictive power of this model relies, however, on clinical documentation in the electronic health record and is subject to residual confounding.

In contrast to the frailty index, the Clinical Frailty Scales is based on clinical judgment of experienced clinicians to summarize the overall frailty or fitness level of older patients. The 9-point scale ranks patients from being “very fit” to terminally ill and is associated with both morbidity and mortality outcomes in ICUs.

This scale, widely used in ICUs in Canada for research purposes, has strong interrater reliability in ICU multidisciplinary teams, Hope commented.

The phenotypic approach may be more difficult than other measures to use in a critical care setting because it relies on physical aspects such as ability to rise from a chair, slow walking speed, low physical activity, and exhaustion. These measures all rely on patient or caregiver recall.

Performance measures to identify frailty include a sit-to-stand test, balance test, gait speed, and mobility stress testing, which may be appropriate in the post-ICU setting but can be hard to apply in a critical care unit.

Impact on Outcomes

Lauren Ferrante, MD, MHS, from the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, noted that although the prevalence of frailty increases with age, from 3.2% in 65- to 70-year-olds to 25.7% in 85- to 89-year-olds in one study, many older adults are not frail, and making assumptions about frailty based only on appearance or immediate circumstances can result in either over- or undertreatment of patients.

However, it is identified “frailty is strongly associated with adverse ICU and hospital outcomes, including mortality,” she said.

In addition, frailty “is associated with worse patient-centered outcomes, including health-related quality-of-life and functional outcomes,” Ferrante said.

She summarized findings from the literature on the effects of frailty on outcomes. For example, in a study published this year in the Annals of Intensive Care, investigators looked at the impact of frailty and older age on weaning patients from invasive mechanical ventilation and found that the highest proportion of patients for whom weaning failed was in those patients who were deemed to be frail, and that frailty had more consistent effect on weaning duration and success rates than older age.

A separate study from the Canadian Critical Care Trials group, published in Intensive Care Medicine in 2024, found that frail patients were more likely than non-frail patients to experience ICU delirium and had higher in-hospital and 6-month mortality rates.

Ferrante and colleagues, Hope and colleagues, and others have also looked at frail patients in longitudinal and cohort studies and found that frailty is associated with post-ICU disabilities and poor functional outcomes.

In addition, patients who are frail have a 3.5-fold higher likelihood of new admissions to a nursing home after a critical illness than non-frail patients.

And as John Muscedere, MD, Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and colleagues reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis, also presented at ATS 2025 International Conference, compared with non-frail patients, those who were frail had a more than twofold relative risk for in-hospital death, had a more than 2.5-fold relative risk for long-term mortality, and were significantly less likely to be discharged home.

“We should be thinking more about augmenting processes of care for frail ICU across the continuum to post-discharge care,” Ferrante said.

She recommend considering automated methods of ascertaining frailty such as the eFrailty Index in the Epic medical record system, which automatically generates a frailty index score from chart data and has the potential to be adapted for use in the ICU.

Clinicians should be cautioned, however, not to conflate automated measurements with severity of illness, which could yield false positive results, she emphasized.

A Confusing Entity

An ICU specialist who attended the session told Medscape Medical News that he wasn’t convinced that the research presented during the session fully addressed the problem of frailty in the ICU.

“I really worry when we think about frailty as a construct in the ICU that we end up putting the cart before the horse. It’s something that we know when we see it, but it’s very difficult to measure, and we’re talking about different things. When we say the word ‘frailty’ we’re not always talking about the same thing, and I definitely worry when we think about developing specific interventions, particularly around ICU patients,” said Jeremy Kahn, MD, MS, professor of critical care medicine and health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh.

“If we don’t really understand what frailty is then we’re going to end up with a lot of negative studies that may be several different diseases that we’re conflating as one,” he said.

Asked by Medscape Medical News whether the idea of an automated frailty index had merit, he replied that “it’s definitely more objective, but then it does raise the question whether you’re measuring something new. We have lots of measures around comorbidities, we have age, which is very predictive, and not to say that frailty isn’t a real thing, but if we can’t measure it in a way differently from age or comorbidities, we’re just using the electronic health record.”

In the absence of an accurate objective measure of frailty, clinicians may be measuring things that they already know, such as comorbidities, or may be identifying patient populations that are diverse and may not be amenable to a single intervention, Kahn told Medscape Medical News.

Hope, Ferrante, and Kahn reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

Maternal Preeclampsia Tied to Kidney Disease Risk in Kids,"TOPLINE:

Children exposed to maternal preeclampsia and born at term (37 weeks or more) were 26% more likely to develop kidney disease in the first year of life than those not exposed. They also faced notably high risks for chronic, unspecified, and diabetic kidney diseases as they grew older, particularly at or after 25 years of age.

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers conducted a nationwide register-based cohort study to examine the association between maternal preeclampsia and the risk for kidney disease in their offspring.

They analysed data of 2,288,589 offsprings born in Denmark between 1978 and 2017, of whom 63,191 (17.7% preterm) were exposed to maternal preeclampsia; mothers of the included offsprings were required to have pregnancy durations of more than 20 weeks.

Information on maternal preeclampsia was identified from the National Patient Register; offsprings were categorised on the basis of their gestational age at birth as early preterm (< 34 weeks), late preterm (34-36 weeks), and term (≥ 37 weeks).

Offsprings were considered to have kidney disease if they were registered with any of the following diagnoses: Acute or chronic kidney disease, glomerular and proteinuric disease, diabetic kidney disease, unspecified kidney disease, or kidney disease due to external causes.

The median follow-up duration of this cohort was 18.8 years.

TAKEAWAY:

During the follow-up period, 37,782 individuals developed kidney disease, including 1150 who were exposed to maternal preeclampsia.

O ffsprings exposed to maternal preeclampsia had a higher risk of developing overall kidney disease within the first year of life, irrespective of gestational age at delivery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.05-1.90 for preterm birth and HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.46 for term birth), than those not exposed to maternal preeclampsia and born at term.

In offsprings born at term, exposure to maternal preeclampsia was strongly associated with increased risks for chronic kidney disease, unspecified kidney disease, and diabetic kidney disease (HR range, 1.36-2.85) at or after the age of 25 years.

Exposure to preeclampsia with preterm delivery was not linked to higher rates of kidney disease in offsprings beyond the first year of life.

IN PRACTICE:

""In adolescents and young adults presenting with signs and symptoms of kidney dysfunction, a history of maternal preeclampsia may warrant an upweighting of kidney disease in the differential diagnosis, despite the patient's youth,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Ida Lihme, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on May 16, 2025, in Kidney International.

LIMITATIONS:

Relatively few individuals were exposed to preterm preeclampsia and developed kidney disease, which may have yielded unstable results in some subanalyses and made it difficult to assess associations with early and late preterm preeclampsia separately. In analyses of individual kidney disease subtypes, evidence for associations with preterm preeclampsia was often lacking, likely due to a lack of statistical power.

"Reframing Anxiety Helps Young People Cope, Says GP","BIRMINGHAM — General practitioners (GPs) can play an important role in helping young people cope with anxiety, delegates heard at The Primary Care Show 2025.

Although anxiety is a normal response to many situations in life, GPs can guide young people to understand this and reframe their angst, according to Fiona Smith, a GP at Eaglescliffe Medical Practice in Stockton-on-Tees, England.

Fiona Smith

“There are ways that we can use language within the consultation — and use youth-friendly consulting — to help young people and families manage the anxiety,” she said.

Smith founded the Footsteps Youth Wellbeing service in 2018, offering support for 11- to 19-year-olds.

She acknowledged the importance of access to cognitive-behavioural therapy. However, she also shared some practical ways in which GPs can address anxiety during 10-minute consultations.

Why Anxiety?

“I’ve heard from a lot of my colleagues locally about the surge in anxiety issues in this generation of young people, and there’s lots of debates about why that might be,” Smith said.

She noted that anxiety is not only just about neurodevelopment but also about the pressures being put on young people by their parents, school, society, and social media.

Teenagers often compare themselves with others online but only see the highlights of others’ lives, Smith said.

Research has found that the peak time for mental health problems to emerge in young people is around 14.5 years. While not all young people who experience anxiety will develop a chronic anxiety-related disorder in adulthood, identifying people earlier can have an important impact on their later mental well-being, “and that’s what we’re really hoping,” said Smith.

“Even if their initial presenting complaint is not feeling anxious and is feeling low in mood or even self-harming or feeling suicidal, there’s always anxiety somewhere within the problem list,” she said.

Normalising Anxiety

Smith said that a good starting point during a consultation might be to ask the young person to describe what they think anxiety is and whether it is good or bad.

“We’re looking to normalise and reduce the stigma,” she said. “Anxiety is a helpful thing if it fits into the situation.”

Being anxious is a natural instinct, but a young person lacks the life experience and limbic system response that can quell levels of anxiety before they get out of proportion to the situation. Smith uses the metaphor of a smoke alarm. “If your limbic system is your smoke alarm, and your smoke alarm at home is going off all the time, but there’s no smoke, then that’s a faulty alarm.”

However, “If your smoke alarm goes off when you have burned the toast, it’s working well. So, that’s one way of helping them to understand when their anxiety is out of proportion with the situation.”

Shifting to Positive Thinking

According to Smith, overthinking and negative thinking can feed anxiety, which is a common problem among young people. Moreover, worrying about physical symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, which may be brought on by anxiety, can also exacerbate the problem.

A key element of the consultation process involves changing the language used and helping young people reframe negative thoughts in a positive way. She also recommended explaining to parents that it can be beneficial for children to express their emotions.

Problems can become worse when they are given too much attention. Simple strategies include setting aside time to talk about worries at the end of the day or visualising the mind as a TV with channels that can be changed to switch to more enjoyable topics.

It is important to encourage young people to step out of their comfort zones, as fear and anxiety are often necessary for growth. “Anxiety can be uncomfortable, but it’s rarely harmful,” said Smith.

Consultation Tools and Techniques

How can primary care professionals help? First, they should “connect” with the young person by being there to talk and listen, said Smith. Second, advise them to “be active” — do what they can, enjoy what they do, and try to “move your mood.” Third, encourage them to “take notice” and remember the simple things that bring joy. Fourth, encourage them to “keep learning” and embrace new experiences and opportunities and “surprise yourself.” Finally, give your time, your words, and your presence.

Smith recommended using two tools for consultations:

RULER, a self-assessment tool that gauges emotional literacy. The acronym stands for:

R: Recognising emotions in oneself and others.

U: Understanding the causes and consequences of emotions.

L: Labelling emotions accurately.

E: Expressing emotions appropriately.

R: Regulating emotions effectively.

The other tool is STOPP, which helps young people take a step back and reassess their situation. The acronym stands for S, stop; T, take a breath; O, observe what’s happening; P, pull back; and P, practise what works for you.

Smith also suggested square breathing: Breathe in, hold, breathe out, and hold again — each for four counts — to regulate the nervous system.

Involving Parents

Parents play a key role in supporting their children. “We shouldn’t overlook parents in terms of the support and the guidance they need in supporting their young people,” Smith said. “We often respond as parents to our young people’s anxiety or children’s anxiety by being anxious ourselves, and that then just reinforces it.”

Smith gives young patients the option to include or exclude their parents or guardians during consultations. She always asks young people if they would like their parent or guardian to be present during the consultation, and if so, they can ask them to leave at any time.

Explaining different parenting styles can also help. With a “helicopter-type parenting style,” when a young person comes to their parent with a problem, “the parent wants to immediately fix it,” Smith explained. “So, the young person never actually builds their own resilience or builds their own tools, or ways, of fixing the problem for themselves — and they always then turn to the parent.”

She suggested the concept of “lighthouse” parenting: Steady support that is there when needed to provide reassurance while allowing the young person to solve their own problems as appropriate. This involves offering encouragement and understanding rather than being the one to fix problems immediately.

The GP Perspective

Michael Dixon, a GP at Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health in Devon, England, welcomed Smith’s approach.

“There’s an awful lot we can actually do simply by talking to the child, validating and explaining, and giving some very simple methods they can use to reduce their anxiety,” he told Medscape News UK. “I think it’s a message that needs to get out, not only to doctors and nurses but also to schools.”

Dixon said that parents often ask GPs for a diagnosis of conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, behavioural disorders, and autism spectrum disorders. However, this has a downside. “People wait a year or 2 before they get a diagnosis, and then another year or 2 before they get help,” he noted. “Giving them labels they can’t do anything else with” could do more harm than good.

Dixon praised Smith’s message that it’s okay for young people to live ordinary lives and not constantly strive for perfection or compare themselves with others. “You don’t have to be the cleverest in the class, the fastest runner, or anything else. I feel our whole virtual world is continually making us feel inadequate for not being the happiest, the loveliest, the most beautiful, the thinnest,” he said.

Adolescent-Friendly Consultations

Separately, Ichechim White, a GP at Aplos Health Primary Care Network in London, England, said youth consultations should be “trauma-informed, neurodevelopmentally appropriate, and held in collaboration with the young person, as well as with outside partnerships and organisations.”

White, who is the adolescent health clinic lead for the network, encourages GPs to use the HEADSSS psychosocial screening tool, which explores:

Home

Education/employment

Activities

Drugs/alcohol

Sexuality

Suicidality/self-harm

Safety, including online behaviour

Consultations should be “strength-based, rather than deficit- or negative-based,” she told Medscape News UK.

Smith, Dixon, and White reported having no financial relationships.

Fortnite returns to iOS in US and Europe,"Fortnite has returned to iOS on Apple's App Store five years after it was first removed.

Its return came a few days after Epic Games filed an injunction against Apple after it blocked the developer's latest Fortnite submission.

While Apple specified it had informed Epic Sweden that it needed to resubmit its submission ""without including the US storefront of the App Store"" (via Associated Press), a federal judge demanded Apple to comply with the court's previous decision.

This decision came on May 1, 2025, when the Northern District of California Court ruled that Apple can no longer collect fees on app purchases made outside its App store.

As reported by TechCrunch, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers demanded Apple to explain the ""legal authority upon which Apple contends that it can ignore this court's order.""

""Apple is fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing,"" Rogers said.

On May 20, Epic confirmed that Fortnite had returned to the App Store. As reported by The Guardian, Apple said the dispute had been resolved.

The legal battle between Epic and Apple began in 2020 after the tech giant removed Fornite from its App Store after accusing Epic of bypassing platform fees.

AMD at Computex 2025: Making the Case for an AI Powerhouse,"Full-service marketing programs from TechNewsWorld deliver sales-ready leads. Segment by geography, industry, company size, job title, and more. Get Started Now.

At Computex 2025 in Taiwan, AMD made its most aggressive play yet to position itself as a top-tier force in AI, both in the data center and at the endpoint.

With sweeping product announcements across GPUs, CPUs, and AI PCs, AMD is signaling that its transformation from a high-performance computing stalwart to a full-spectrum AI leader is well underway.

The company’s vision is clear: dominate at every layer of the AI stack — from gaming and client devices to professional workstations and hyperscale AI training platforms.

Two-Pronged AI Offensive: Cloud to Client

AMD’s message focused on one key idea: the future of AI will not be exclusively in the cloud. A hybrid approach, spanning data centers, local workstations, and AI-powered PCs, will define the next decade of compute.

On the cloud and AI data center front, AMD leaned heavily on its EPYC and Instinct product lines, which continue to serve hyperscalers like Meta and Netflix.

However, the breakout spotlight fell on the new Radeon AI PRO R9700, a workstation GPU designed to bring high-performance AI processing to the edge. With 32GB of VRAM, PCIe Gen 5 support, and up to 4x higher AI accelerator throughput than its predecessor, the R9700 aims to power everything from local LLM fine-tuning to real-time video generation.

The Radeon AI PRO R9700 aligns with AMD’s push to enable AI workloads where data is most sensitive, or latency is most critical. It isn’t just a spec bump — it’s a declaration that AMD intends to make edge-based AI a mainstream part of the developer stack.

On the client side, AMD revealed its Ryzen AI 300 Series and accompanying Ryzen AI Pro chips, headlined by the Ryzen AI Max, which AMD claims outperforms Apple’s M4 Pro by 15%. With up to 50 TOPS of NPU performance and dedicated hardware for vision, audio, and language processing, these chips aim to cement AMD’s position as the top silicon vendor for the exploding AI PC category.

AI Ecosystem Strategy Powered by Partnerships

AMD underscored its platform approach through deep partnerships with Lenovo, Asus, and TSMC:

TSMC, one of AMD’s closest strategic partners, praised the battery life and AI performance of AMD-powered Asus laptops deployed across its global operations, validating AMD’s claims about power efficiency and real-world productivity gains.

These collaborations weren’t token mentions; they represent focal points of AMD’s proof that its ecosystem is rallying around AI, not just as a feature but as a core computing model.

AI-Driven Gaming: AMD’s New Focus

While AI took the lead, AMD also reinforced its gaming dominance. The newly introduced Radeon RX 9060 XT delivers top-tier 1440p gaming performance for under $350 and features 16GB of VRAM with 821 TOPS of AI compute. The RX 9060 XT is an AI-first gaming GPU that demonstrates how machine learning can enhance upscaling, frame generation, and ray tracing without relying on brute-force rendering.

The highlight was FSR Redstone, AMD’s next-gen machine learning-based rendering engine. Building on FSR4, Redstone incorporates neural radiance caching, ray regeneration, and ML super-resolution technologies that rival Nvidia’s DLSS in quality but are optimized for broader accessibility across GPUs.

AMD also revealed a compelling co-development with Sony PlayStation called Project Amethyst, aimed at rethinking the future of immersive gaming using shared AI pipelines across consoles and PCs.

Threadripper for Creative AI Workstations

AMD’s workstation ambitions got a massive lift with its Ryzen Threadripper PRO 9000 WX-Series unveiling. The flagship 9995WX offers 96 cores and 192 threads, built on the Zen 5 architecture. AMD claims it outpaces the competition by 80%, aimed squarely at VFX studios, engineers, and AI developers who need sustained, scalable compute.

To underscore the significance of this performance boost, AMD showcased Weta FX, the visual effects powerhouse behind major films such as “Avatar” and “The Lord of the Rings,” announced that it’s replacing its entire render farm with AMD-based systems, citing 60% faster performance versus previous solutions.

This combination of Threadripper CPUs and Radeon AI GPUs forms the basis of what AMD dubs “the world’s most powerful AI workstation platform,” ready to run large models like Llama 4 or DeepSeek R1 locally and securely.

ROCm Comes to Windows: A Critical Software Shift

AMD acknowledged a major Achilles’ heel: software. Historically, ROCm, its open-source software stack for AI acceleration, was focused on Linux and hyperscale environments. But developers wanted full client-side support. AMD’s answer: ROCm for Windows is coming in the second half of 2025, with out-of-the-box support for PyTorch and ONNX execution providers.

This move could be transformative for developers working on AMD hardware, unlocking easier access to local model training, fine-tuning, and inference. With growing client hardware support, AMD intends to compete head-to-head with Nvidia and Intel in developer mindshare.

Tailwinds and Potential Headwinds

The broader market dynamics also favor AMD’s AI pivot:

Microsoft’s Copilot+ push is helping redefine what a PC should be, shifting focus toward NPU and on-device AI.

Apple’s M-series chips drive awareness that AI performance is not just a cloud topic but a personal productivity tool.

Enterprise interest in privacy-preserving, local AI is surging, aligning with AMD’s hybrid compute approach.

However, AMD isn’t without challenges:

Nvidia remains dominant in the maturity of developer tools, model support, and CUDA ecosystem.

Intel’s Lunar Lake chips, set to ship in volume later this year, may blunt AMD’s performance edge in AI PCs if Microsoft’s tight integration favors Intel more.

ROCm adoption must prove it can deliver ease of use and support at scale. Without that, AMD risks being seen as “open but incomplete.”

AMD’s AI Transformation Is Real But Not Yet Complete

At Computex 2025, AMD delivered the most cohesive and ambitious argument that it is ready to lead in AI, from consumer PCs and gaming rigs to enterprise workstations and cloud-alternative infrastructures.

Its strengths lie in platform breadth, energy efficiency, and open-standards-based software. However, its biggest hurdles remain developer engagement and ecosystem maturity. If AMD can turn ROCm into a genuine rival to CUDA and ensure real-world performance translates into share gains, then it’s not just participating in the AI era—it could help define it.

The transformation is underway; however, whether AMD becomes the AI powerhouse it envisions will depend on the speed and execution of factors beyond silicon. Give credit to AMD CEO Lisa Su, who has continued transforming the company into an entity few would have believed possible 10 years ago.

Google AI Mode traffic is untrackable,"Google’s newly launched AI Mode in Search isn’t passing referral data. That means it’s impossible to know how many clicks you got from AI Mode in your analytics tools. Clicks also aren’t appearing in Google Search Console (GSC).

Why we care. You have no way of knowing how much traffic you’re getting from AI Mode. Google continues to tell us its AI answers drive higher-quality clicks, without proof. We have no data to verify this. Frustratingly, Google continues to take away helpful data, making it impossible for us to make data-driven decisions.

Driving the news: Tom Critchlow, EVP audience growth at Raptive, first raised the issue on LinkedIn. Testing from Patrick Stox, product advisor, technical SEO, and brand ambassador at Ahrefs, confirmed that you can’t track clicks from AI Mode:

Clicks on links shown in AI Mode don’t appear in Google Search Console.

Analytics tools classify these visits as Direct or Unknown.

The links generated in AI Mode are marked with a noreferrer attribute, which strips the referrer value that would otherwise enable attribution.

Why? Lily Ray, vice president, SEO strategy and research at Amsive, shared her theory on LinkedIn, dubbing this “Not Provided 2.0” (a reference to when Google began encrypting searches and outbound clicks by default):

“Google does NOT want us having access to traffic data for AI Mode, or AI Overviews for that matter, because it will reveal just how little traffic both are actually driving to external websites.

It’s much more convenient to continue repeating some carefully crafted statement about how these tools ‘drive traffic to more websites than ever,’ without giving us any tools to confirm this.”

Temporary or permanent? In the Measuring the performance of your site section of the AI features and your website Google Search Central help document, Google wrote:

Just like the rest of the search results page, sites appearing in AI features (such as AI Overviews and AI Mode) are included in the overall search traffic in Search Console. In particular, they’re reported on in the Performance report, within the “Web” search type.

When you visit the GSC What are impressions, position, and clicks? page, there is no mention of AI Mode. Only AI Overviews are mentioned.

Also, Google’s newest blog post wrote seemed to be saying that we should no longer “focus too much on clicks” and more on “the overall value of your visits from Search.”

What Google is saying. Will AI Mode traffic data become visible? Perhaps, based on what Google’s John Mueller said on Linkedin :

“This seems unexpected … I saw this somewhere else and had already sent it to the team to check, but haven’t heard back.”

For now, we remain in the dark.",https://searchengineland.com/googles-ai-mode-traffic-untrackable-455883,Technology
Chinese hackers breach US local governments using Cityworks zero-day,"Chinese-speaking hackers have exploited a now-patched Trimble Cityworks zero-day to breach multiple local governing bodies across the United States.

Trimble Cityworks is a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based asset management and work order management software primarily used by local governments, utilities, and public works organizations and designed to help infrastructure agencies and municipalities manage public assets, handle permitting and licensing, and process work orders.

The hacking group (UAT-6382) behind this campaign used a Rust-based malware loader to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons and VSHell malware designed to backdoor compromised systems and provide long-term persistent access, as well as web shells and custom malicious tools written in Chinese.

These attacks started in January 2025, when Cisco Talos observed the first signs of reconnaissance activity within the breached organizations' networks.

""Talos has found intrusions in enterprise networks of local governing bodies in the United States (U.S.), beginning January 2025 when initial exploitation first took place. Upon gaining access, UAT-6382 expressed a clear interest in pivoting to systems related to utilities management,"" said Cisco Talos security researchers Asheer Malhotra and Brandon White.

""The web shells, including AntSword, chinatso/Chopper and generic file uploaders, contained messaging written in the Chinese language. Furthermore, the custom tooling, TetraLoader, was built using a malware-builder called 'MaLoader' that is also written in Simplified Chinese.""

Federal agencies warned to patch immediately

The security flaw exploited in these attacks (CVE-2025-0994) is a high-severity deserialization vulnerability that allows authenticated threat actors to execute code remotely on the targets' Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers.

In early February 2025, when it released security updates to patch this vulnerability, Trimble warned that it was aware of attackers trying to exploit CVE-2025-0994 to breach some Cityworks deployments.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also added CVE-2025-0994 to its catalog of actively exploited vulnerabilities on February 7, ordering federal agencies to patch their systems within three weeks as mandated by the November 2021 Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.

""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,"" the cybersecurity agency warned.

Days later, on February 11, CISA released an advisory warning to organizations in the water and wastewater systems, energy, transportation systems, government services and facilities, and communications sectors to ""install the updated version immediately.""",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-breach-us-local-governments-using-cityworks-zero-day/,Technology

Graduate Student Solves Classic Problem About the Limits of Addition,"The simplest ideas in mathematics can also be the most perplexing.

Take addition. It’s a straightforward operation: One of the first mathematical truths we learn is that 1 plus 1 equals 2. But mathematicians still have many unanswered questions about the kinds of patterns that addition can give rise to. “This is one of the most basic things you can do,” said Benjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford. “Somehow, it’s still very mysterious in a lot of ways.”

In probing this mystery, mathematicians also hope to understand the limits of addition’s power. Since the early 20th century, they’ve been studying the nature of “sum-free” sets — sets of numbers in which no two numbers in the set will add to a third. For instance, add any two odd numbers and you’ll get an even number. The set of odd numbers is therefore sum-free.

In a 1965 paper, the prolific mathematician Paul Erdős asked a simple question about how common sum-free sets are. But for decades, progress on the problem was negligible.

“It’s a very basic-sounding thing that we had shockingly little understanding of,” said Julian Sahasrabudhe, a mathematician at the University of Cambridge.

Until this February. Sixty years after Erdős posed his problem, Bedert solved it. He showed that in any set composed of integers — the positive and negative counting numbers — there’s a large subset of numbers that must be sum-free. His proof reaches into the depths of mathematics, honing techniques from disparate fields to uncover hidden structure not just in sum-free sets, but in all sorts of other settings.

“It’s a fantastic achievement,” Sahasrabudhe said.

Stuck in the Middle

Erdős knew that any set of integers must contain a smaller, sum-free subset. Consider the set {1, 2, 3}, which is not sum-free. It contains five different sum-free subsets, such as {1} and {2, 3}.

Erdős wanted to know just how far this phenomenon extends. If you have a set with a million integers, how big is its biggest sum-free subset?

In many cases, it’s huge. If you choose a million integers at random, around half of them will be odd, giving you a sum-free subset with about 500,000 elements.

Paul Erdős was famous for his ability to come up with deep conjectures that continue to guide mathematics research today. George Csicsery

In his 1965 paper, Erdős showed — in a proof that was just a few lines long, and hailed as brilliant by other mathematicians — that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset of at least N/3 elements.

Still, he wasn’t satisfied. His proof dealt with averages: He found a collection of sum-free subsets and calculated that their average size was N/3. But in such a collection, the biggest subsets are typically thought to be much larger than the average.

Erdős wanted to measure the size of those extra-large sum-free subsets.

Mathematicians soon hypothesized that as your set gets bigger, the biggest sum-free subsets will get much larger than N/3. In fact, the deviation will grow infinitely large. This prediction — that the size of the biggest sum-free subset is N/3 plus some deviation that grows to infinity with N — is now known as the sum-free sets conjecture.

“It is surprising that this simple question seems to present considerable difficulties,” Erdős wrote in his original paper, “but perhaps we overlook the obvious.”

For decades, nothing obvious revealed itself. No one could improve on Erdős’ proof. “The longer it went without people being able to improve on that simple bound, the more cachet this problem acquired,” said Ben Green, Bedert’s doctoral adviser at Oxford. And, he added, this was precisely the kind of problem where “it’s very, very hard to do any better at all.”

Confronting the Norm

After 25 years without improving on Erdős’ original result, mathematicians finally began inching forward. In 1990, two researchers proved that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset with at least N/3 + 1/3 elements, more commonly written as (N + 1)/3.

But since the size of a set is always a whole number, an increase of 1/3 is often inconsequential. For example, if you know that a sum-free subset has to have at least 5/3 elements, that means its size is guaranteed to be 2 or more. If you add 1/3 to 5/3, your answer is still 2. “It’s funny, it means that it doesn’t actually always improve it,” said David Conlon of the California Institute of Technology. “It’s only when N is divisible by 3 that it improves it.”

In 1997, the mathematical legend Jean Bourgain nudged the bound up to (N + 2)/3. The result might have seemed hardly worth mentioning, but buried in Bourgain’s paper was a startling breakthrough. He described an idea for how to prove that the biggest sum-free subsets would be arbitrarily bigger than that. He just couldn’t pin down the details to turn it into a full proof.

“The paper’s almost like, here’s how I tried to solve the problem and why it didn’t work,” Sahasrabudhe said.

Jean Bourgain devised a creative strategy for proving the sum-free sets conjecture. George M. Bergman, Berkeley

Bourgain relied on a quantity called the Littlewood norm, which measures a given set’s structure. This quantity, which comes from a field of mathematics called Fourier analysis, tends to be large if a set is more random, and small if the set exhibits more structure.

Bourgain showed that if a set with N elements has a large Littlewood norm, then it must also have a sum-free set that’s much larger than N/3. But he couldn’t make progress in the case where the set has a small Littlewood norm.

“Bourgain is famously competent,” said Sean Eberhard of the University of Warwick. “It’s a very striking marker of how difficult this problem is.”

Bourgain ultimately had to use a different argument to get his bound of (N + 2)/3. But mathematicians read between the lines: They might be able to use the Littlewood norm to completely settle the conjecture. They just had to figure out how to deal with sets with a small Littlewood norm.

There was reason to be optimistic: Mathematicians already knew of sets with a small Littlewood norm that have massive sum-free subsets. These sets, called arithmetic progressions, consist of evenly spaced numbers, such as {5, 10, 15, 20}. Mathematicians suspected that any set with a small Littlewood norm has a very specific structure — that it’s more or less a collection of many different arithmetic progressions (with a few tweaks). They hoped that if they could show this, they’d be able to use that property to prove that any set with a small Littlewood norm has a large sum-free subset.

But this task wasn’t easy. “I certainly tried to prove the sum-free conjecture using [Bourgain’s] ideas,” Green said, but “we still don’t understand much about the structure of sets with small Littlewood norm. Everything to do with Littlewood is difficult.”

And so, though mathematicians continued to have faith in Bourgain’s Littlewood-based strategy, nothing happened.

More than two decades passed. Then, in the fall of 2021, Benjamin Bedert started graduate school.

Notorious Problems

With Green as his doctoral adviser, it was inevitable that Bedert would come across the sum-free sets conjecture. Green’s website lists 100 open problems; this one appears first.

Bedert perused the list shortly after he began his graduate studies. At first, he shied away from the sum-free sets problem. “I was like, this is super difficult, I’m not going to think about this,” he recalled. “I’ll leave this for the future.”

The future arrived soon enough. In summer 2024, Bedert decided he was ready for a riskier project. “I’d proved some reasonably good results in my Ph.D. so far, and kind of put a thesis together already,” he said. “I started thinking about these more, I guess, notorious problems.”",https://www.quantamagazine.org/graduate-student-solves-classic-problem-about-the-limits-of-addition-20250522/,Technology
AROS turns any PC into an Amiga with USB-bootable distro,"The FOSS recreation of AmigaOS is making progress. A new edition runs entirely from a USB key, so you can temporarily turn your PC into an Amiga – without any tricky installation process.

The AROS Research OS – AROS for short – has been around for 30 years, but it keeps a relatively low profile compared to more visible FOSS OSes such as Linux, the BSDs, or even Haiku. In April, a new x86-64 port was released, complementing the existing ports for x86-32, Motorola 68000, PowerPC, and Arm processor architectures. Downloads are already available, but it's early days, and more complete distributions should follow soon. The AROS News site regularly publishes bulletins describing what's new.

AROS has a full graphical desktop, loads of demos and applets, and runs direct from a USB key – click to enlarge

This month sees the release of a new portable distribution, which boots and runs entirely from a USB key, like a Linux distro. The image is a 3.2 GB download, which decompresses to a 16 GB disk image, and for decent performance you should use a USB 3.0 flash drive. The demo video shows it running top-down shooter BOH and the Odyssey web browser.

Youtube Video

We managed to get it to boot on our most recent UEFI laptop, and it runs well – although it crashed when we attempted to shut it down. When we wrote that it boots like a live Linux distro, we didn't realize how literally accurate that was. We did a little detective work, and in fact, it is a live Linux distro: the USB key image is in fact a Linux ext4 drive containing a copy of Ubuntu 25.04 (with the i3 window manager), which is set to log in automatically as a user called aros , and then runs QEMU full-screen and boots AROS inside the VM. The associated scripts are written in Polish, which isn't in The Reg FOSS desk's repertoire but is close enough to Czech to get the general drift.

So it's a sort of cheat, but it gets the job done. You can boot AROS from a live USB medium and run it without installing anything. What you get is the AROS One x86 distribution, configured with dozens of apps, games, and demos.

The original AmigaOS was written for the original 68000-based Amiga, 40 years ago now. Its design was groundbreaking for its time: it had color graphics and sound to beat any other mass-market machine, as well as a desktop GUI and full preemptive multitasking. The final release from Commodore was AmigaOS 3.1 in 1994, and the company went under later that year.

The Commodore and Amiga brands' intellectual property and software have been contested ever since. Different companies own different parts of the company's legacy, and over 30 years later, the lawsuits continue, as the Amiga Documents site describes.

AROS cuts through the rather tangled world of Amiga and various proprietary or partly proprietary Amiga operating systems. It's a ground-up reimplementation, an all-FOSS OS that aims to be source-compatible with AmigaOS 3.1. It's mainly developed on commodity x86 hardware, although there's also a version ported back to 68000 that can run on Amiga emulators or even on a real Amiga. Another version runs under Linux on Arm hardware.

By modern standards, AmigaOS is tiny and quite simple, and since original Amiga apps are for Motorola 68000 processors, AROS on x86 is by definition not binary-compatible with the original OS. 68000 code can't run natively on AROS, which to a degree frees the AROS developers from maintaining precise one-to-one compatibility.

The result is a surprisingly complete OS. It's got an Amiga shell-compatible command line, a desktop GUI called Wanderer, a network stack, and so on. As you'd expect for a platform that's been around for 40 years, it's got a wealth of apps, including lots of text editors, graphics packages, and file managers. It has drivers to talk to USB peripherals and so on.

The flipside of it being an OS with roots in the mid-1980s is that AmigaOS predates - among others - OS/2, Windows 3, Linux and NeXTstep. The desktop isn't very much like any of these or anything you've seen on any other OS; there's a slight resemblance to classic MacOS, and that's about it. There's a status bar across the top of the screen, like iOS or GNOME, which by default shows how much free memory you have. When you right-click this it becomes the menu bar, and that's where you find the menus of desktop apps. Drive icons appear on the desktop, arranged from top-left downward.

The file manager uses multiple windows for navigation, and there's no tree view of folders here because nobody had invented things like that in GUIs yet when the design of this OS's role model was established. Each window has a path entry box, into which you can type the name of a device or its path. At the end, there's a downward-pointing button. This takes you down a level toward the root directory. It's the reverse of the direction we're used to, which treats going to a parent directory as going up – but AmigaOS predates such UI conventions, and this way is undeniably logical. After all, a tree's roots are at its base, below the branches.

This is one small demonstration of a general point, though. Another is that conventional PC keystrokes like Alt+F4 to close a window, or Mac ones like Cmd+W, don't work here. Exploring AROS means relearning a lot of interactions and mechanisms.

There are some snags. One of the things that doomed the original Amiga is that while AmigaOS was a multitasking GUI OS that booted from a single 880 KB floppy disk and could run in half a megabyte of memory, its design meant that it couldn't adopt the improvements in later Motorola chips, such as the 68030 with its built-in memory-management unit. AROS does multitask, but it crashed on us several times during testing.

There's a lot here to explore. Alongside the demo apps, it has ready-made folders for you to copy real Amiga apps and games into. AROS can emulate classic Amigas to run their software, and you can download an ISO image of AROS and install it onto real hardware – although from our testing, we suggest avoiding any attempt to dual-boot.

Compared to some alternative PC OSes we've looked at, such as the C++-based Unix-like Serenity OS, or the Rust-based Redox OS, AROS is enviably complete. This is a mature, established OS with its own community of app developers, as well as lots of older apps that run under emulation. The Amiga even boasted big-name products such as WordPerfect, for instance. In this way, it reminds us a little of RISC OS, but AROS runs on ordinary PC hardware.

This isn't a strange experimental OS, and it's a native GUI desktop OS, so it's still much easier to find your way around by point-and-click than it is with any of the BSDs, let alone outliers such as Plan 9 fork 9front.

Offshoots of the real original Amiga are still around. As well as its FPGA accelerators for classic Commodore kit, Apollo Computer makes standalone devices, as The Register announced back in 2017. Their native OS, ApolloOS, is based on the 68000 version of AROS. You can also still buy PowerPC-based Amiga hardware, which runs AmigaOS 4.1.

The trouble is that these machines are specialist kit for a small market, and that makes them significantly more expensive. They're well beyond most people's toy budget for casual curiosity – which for us is one of the things that makes RISC OS on a Raspberry Pi interesting, especially as it will run well even on an early Raspberry Pi. We really wish there was a native, bare-metal version of AROS for the RasPi.

The next best thing is something like TheA500 mini from Retro Games Ltd. The keyboard of this tiny Arm-based device is non-functional: it's mainly for playing classic Amiga games. Slightly more expensive is the A600GS from AmigaKit, which similarly uses an Arm board to emulate classic Amiga hardware, but is designed for use with external USB peripherals. Both companies are working on larger, more ambitious devices, and we hope to return with more information on them soon.

Just like Linux, there are multiple distributions of AROS to explore, such as AROS Live's parent AROS One and Tiny AROS. It hasn't been updated in a long time, but there is also Icaros, designed to run under VMware.

In the meantime, AROS Live is a good way to start exploring AROS. If you ever owned an Amiga in the late 20th century – or even if you were curious, or simply coveted one – you should try AROS. It's fun, it's nostalgic, and there's a lot here to explore. ®",https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/22/aros_live/,Technology
Exposure to Antibiotics Preterm May Affect Lung Function,"TOPLINE:

Premature infants exposed to multiple courses of antibiotics around the time of birth had weaker lung function and a higher risk for asthma episodes by early school age than those with lower exposure.

METHODOLOGY:

The study analyzed 3820 premature infants born between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation with low birth weights (< 1500 g); the infants were enrolled from 58 hospitals across Germany over an 8-year period starting in January 2009.

Researchers divided the infants into three groups: Low-risk, or those exposed via their mothers who were given surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis in the 30 minutes before delivery; intermediate-risk, or children exposed prenatally and after birth; and high-risk, or children who had been exposed within 7 days of delivery prenatally, again at 30 minutes prior to birth, and after birth.

The primary outcome was the lung function and the amount of air each infant exhaled in the first second of forced exhalation, measured at ages 5-7 years. Secondary outcomes included the total amount of air exhaled or forced vital capacity and asthma episodes during childhood.

The analysis included 3109 participants born by cesarean delivery, with 292 (9.4%) in the low-risk group, 1329 (42.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 1488 (47.9%) in the high-risk group.

TAKEAWAY:

Children with intermediate risk scores had poorer lung function than those with low risk scores, as shown by lower forced exhalation in one second outcomes (β, −0.31; 95% CI, −0.59 to −0.02; P = .03).

Those with high-risk antibiotic exposure vs intermediate risk had lower forced vital capacity scores (β, −0.23; 95% CI, −0.43 to −0.03; P = .02).

Children with the highest level of exposure to antibiotics had a higher risk for early childhood asthma episodes than those with intermediate risk (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.32-2.76; P = .001).

IN PRACTICE:

“Early identification of high-risk neonates may enable targeted strategies to support respiratory health and optimize long-term outcomes,” the study authors wrote.

SOURCE:

The study was led by Ingmar Fortmann, MD, of the Department of Pediatrics at the University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein at Campus Lübeck in Lübeck, Germany. It was published online on May 12 in JAMA Network Open.

LIMITATIONS:

The study had a low median follow-up rate that varied across clinics. The researchers did not have details on the dosage of antibiotics. Only children well enough to take lung function tests were included. Infants who received more antibiotics already had poor health status, which may have accounted for some of the findings.

DISCLOSURES:

One or more study authors reported receiving financial support fromthe Advanced Clinician Scientist Program and Section of Medicine at the University of Lübeck, personal fees from Chiesi, and grants from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. No other disclosures were reported.

Founded in 1927, Volvo sells to customers in more than 100 countries, and has the ambition to become a fully electric carmaker as part of its commitment to an ongoing reduction of its carbon footprint, achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.

The extended partnership will see Volvo​ car​s serve as one of Google’s reference hardware platforms for future Android development in cars.

Volvo models with Google technology built-in, in particular the Gemini AI platform, include the Volvo EX90, an all-electric Volvo EX90 sports utility vehicle (SUV). Volvo says that among the features of the seven-seat family vehicle is an “invisible shield” of safety enabled by sensing technology including cameras, radars and lidar. These are connected to the car’s high core computers running Volvo Cars’ in-house software to create a real-time, 360-degree view of the world.

In addition, the core software system is powered by Nvidia Drive AI platforms Xavier and Orin, Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms from Qualcomm Technologies and in-house developed software by Volvo engineers. These run most of the core functions inside the car, from safety and infotainment to battery management.

Future software will also include Google Gemini AI, and Volvo cars with Google built-in will be among the first to benefit from the latest conversational AI technology.

Volvo believes that with Gemini in the car, drivers can better understand ​what they want through natural conversations​. They can talk naturally to craft messages, translate them into another language before sending, ask questions from the car’s user manual or learn specific details about a destination. Natural conversation is seen to help reduce drivers’ cognitive load so they can stay focused on driving, reducing distractions for everyone onboard.

Gemini will replace the current Google Assistant in Volvo cars with Google built-in later in 2025, and Volvo​ car​s will now serve as one of Google’s reference hardware platforms for future Android development in cars. This means Google will use Volvo as a lead development partner for ​new ​features and updates, before adding them to the main Android codebase.

Google is confident that the upshot of this is that it and Volvo Cars can “innovate together” on new connected experiences​, making sure Volvo drivers will be among the first to enjoy the latest Android features and performance enhancements. They also expect their partnership to ​accelerate advancements in the connected car space for the entire automotive industry and drivers around the world.

Patrick Brady, vice-president of Android for Cars at Google, said: “For years, Google and Volvo Cars have collaborated closely to bring cutting-edge technology to connected cars. We’re excited to deepen this partnership, accelerating the pace of innovation that will not only improve the driving experience for Volvo customers, but also set new benchmarks for the automotive industry.”

Alwin Bakkenes, head of global software engineering at Volvo Cars, added: “We strive to deliver human-centric technology, and a stunning customer experience is an essential part of this. Through this partnership with Google, we are able to bring the very latest features and capabilities from the leading consumer ecosystem into our products first. With our expanding partnership, we’re collaborating on cutting-edge solutions that shape the future of connected cars.”",https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366624216/Google-gets-in-gear-with-Volvo-to-drive-connected-vehicle-AI,Technology
"Neptune OS is Debian made easy, but needs a cleanup","Neptune is a moderately tweaked Debian remix with KDE Plasma 5, a few alternative app choices, and a longer history than we anticipated.

Neptune OS sounded to us like it might appeal to quite a few people. Its about page tells you it's based on Debian stable, with KDE as a pragmatic choice of desktop, plus some selected newer apps than Debian itself includes. For instance, instead of Debian's ESR release of Firefox, you get a more recent version of Chromium.

The latest release, version 8.1, came out during Easter, and the announcement mentions some of the other changes. Rather than the KDE defaults that Debian offers, you get the Thunderbird messaging client and the VLC media player. So far, so good. These are solid choices. Also, as we described a few years ago, upgrading Debian to a newer web browser can be tricky. Neptune pre-installs Flatpak support, making it easy to add newer apps than Debian's conservative – and thus sometimes rather dated – collection. However, no flatpaks are installed by default.

As we mentioned when we covered LastOS Linux, we plan to take a look at a few less well-known distros that are candidates to replace Windows 10 for users who don't have the option of upgrading come the ""End of 10"" this October. It's not all that easy to turn a fresh Debian install into something fully functional with working drivers, media codecs, and so on. Neptune does this for you.

There's a lot here to enjoy, but as a result, resource usage is high – click to enlarge

The installation is pretty simple. Neptune boots into a live desktop environment, and uses the Calamares cross-distro installer, which is more flexible than Debian's approach. We did notice some small oddities, though. We tested in VirtualBox 7, which assigned our VM 20 GB of disk space, which should be plenty. Neptune's installer assigned a whopping 8 GB of this to a swap partition. That's equal to the amount of RAM we gave the VM, but that's an awful lot of swap by modern standards. We tried to do a custom install, but for no apparent reason it only offered us the option to create an LVM layout, which we didn't want. We accepted the defaults, and the result was that the OS was squeezed into an 11.2 GB primary partition. That isn't really enough space. Neptune itself used about 10 GB, leaving too little room to perform a post-install system update. It filled the root partition and the update failed, forcing us to do some manual cleanup and repair operations.

Now, true, 20 GB isn't much disk space for a modern OS, but that's not what we are questioning here. What we're pointing out is that the installer assigned an unnecessarily large amount of swap space. Secondly, we wondered why it took ten gigs of disk, which is a lot. For comparison, we installed a vanilla copy of the newly released Debian 12.11. Even with VirtualBox Guest Additions installed, it only uses 6.4 GB of space, and it assigns a reasonable 1 GB of swap.

KDE's partition manager, showing a lot of empty swap space and a perilously full root volume – click to enlarge

We were curious, both about where that disk space went, and what the distro's logo meant. Neptune uses a lower case Greek letter zeta as its logo. The project's own history page only goes back to Neptune 4.0 (versions 4.0 through 4.5 are listed twice, oddly) but Distrowatch has more info about that version:

Leszek Lesner has announced the release of Neptune 4.0 (formerly known as ZevenOS ""Neptune"" edition)

Longtime Register readers may remember ZevenOS. We mentioned it way back in 2013, and although its domain is no longer active, Distrowatch still has a page on it. ZevenOS was an unofficial Ubuntu remix with Xfce, customized to look remarkably like BeOS. As we have said before, The Reg FOSS desk was a big fan of BeOS, and we liked and used ZevenOS for a while. ZevenOS 1.0 – complete with a lower-case zeta as its logo – appeared in 2008, the year after yellowTab Zeta was discontinued. Zeta was a continuation of BeOS, based on the code of ""Dano,"" the unreleased beta of what would have been BeOS 5.1 or 6.0.

With Zeta dead, ZetaOS was a notable effort to bring some of the looks and functionality of BeOS's Tracker desktop to Linux. Neptune started out as ""ZetaOS Neptune Edition,"" the BeOS-a-like distro's slightly more mainstream sibling, using Debian instead of Ubuntu, and KDE instead of a custom Xfce. This explains the small mystery of the logo, and also its emphasis on media codecs and tools.

As for the size, there are some non-obvious extra tools included in Neptune 8.1. It includes the Ardour digital audio workstation and the Kdenlive video editing suite, as well as multiple media playback tools, image editors, and more. There are two web browsers (Chromium and Konqueror), two terminal emulators (Konsole and Yakuake), and two backup programs (Timeshift for OS files and Back in Time for user data). As well as LibreOffice Writer, there's ReText for Markdown. These are all good tools, but duplication takes space, and some of them are perhaps a little specialized for a general audience.

There's more besides. The login screen reveals a choice of desktops. As well as KDE 5.27.5 (which, as we noted when looking at the latest MX Linux, isn't the latest and final version of KDE 5, which is Plasma 5.27.12), in both X11 and Plasma versions, there's also a functional if bare Enlightenment E16 desktop session available, plus non-functional options called ""E16 GNOME 2"" and ""E16 KDE"".

There's a working Enlightenment E16 desktop as well – click to enlarge

We installed Debian 12.11 for comparison, and it's definitely a bit less ready for use. You need a separate user account for root and the sudo command doesn't work by default. To install VirtualBox drivers, we needed to manually install DKMS. Neptune does this, and more, for you, and as a result it works more smoothly out of the metaphorical box. But there's a price to pay for that. It's bigger and it has some substantial extra components that we suspect most people will never need. We'd like to see it relegate the advanced media creation tools to being optional extras, ship the final release of KDE Plasma 5, and either remove Enlightenment or go all-in and default to it.

This project has quite a long history, and that goes some way to explaining why it's accumulated a significant amount of duplicated components, all the way up to having two desktop environments. That, in turn, explains why it takes more than 10 GB of disk space. The distro's roots go back 17 years and a bit of housekeeping is needed. Saying that, as an easier way to get a media-ready version of Debian, Neptune does have some appeal. ®",https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/22/neptune_os/,Technology

OnePlus Nord 5 series leak hints at resemblance to Ace 5 Ultra and Racing Edition,"The OnePlus Nord 4 was released in July 2024. Now, the company is expected to launch the Nord 5 and Nord 5 CE. A recent leak suggests that the Nord 5 models may share a similar design with the upcoming Ace 5 phones launching in China.

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

The OnePlus Nord series features mid-range smartphones. The company is now expected to release the Nord 5 and the Nord 5 CE. So far, there are no official details regarding the phones. However, a new leak has surfaced online suggesting details regarding the design language of the upcoming Nord 5 models.

In China, OnePlus is set to launch two new phones: the Ace 5 Ultra and Ace 5 Racing Edition. A new leak (via The Tech Outlook) suggests that the Nord 5 and Nord 5 CE may look similar to the upcoming Ace 5 models. If that turns out to be true, the Nord 5 models will have a pill-shaped rear camera module. The mid-range phones may also feature an action button and an IR blaster.

In the past, we have seen many Ace phones being rebranded for the global market. For example, the standard Ace 5 was globally launched as the OnePlus 13R (curr. available for $499 on Amazon). Hence, the similarity between the new Ace models and the Nord 5 lineup may extend beyond just the design. OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra and Racing Edition expected specifications

The OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra is said to feature a 6.83-inch OLED screen. OnePlus has confirmed it will be powered by the Dimensity 9400+, a flagship processor from MediaTek. Another highlight of the phone is expected to be its large 7,000mAh battery. It is expected to have a rear camera setup comprising a 50MP primary and an 8MP ultra-wide lens. On the other hand, the Ace 5 Racing Edition is a more affordable phone. It is confirmed to be powered by the new Dimensity 9400e processor. It may rumored to feature a 6.77-inch OLED panel and a 7,000mAh battery. The Racing Edition may utilize a dual rear camera setup featuring a 50MP primary lens and a 2MP depth sensor.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-Nord-5-series-leak-hints-at-resemblance-to-Ace-5-Ultra-and-Racing-Edition.1021333.0.html,Technology
A Rugged Redesign: Formex Unveils Field Automatic Gen 2,"Formex has announced the launch of the Field Automatic Gen 2, a bold evolution of the brand’s adventure-focused tool watch, now reimagined with enhanced functionality, refined construction, and a striking new aesthetic. The watch is available with three dial color ways and several strap options.

Housed in a 40mm x 10.5mm Grade 2 titanium case, which weighs only 54 grams, the Field Automatic Gen 2 is engineered to withstand the elements while maintaining a sleek profile that slips comfortably under a cuff. Formex has treated the titanium with a proprietary hardening process, increasing its surface hardness from 145 Vickers to an impressive 900 HV — nearly three times harder than conventional Grade 5 titanium, without sacrificing its lightness, skin-friendliness, or corrosion resistance. The sandblasted matte finish and faceted edges give the case, which is water-resistant to 150 meters, a utilitarian yet refined character, true to the spirit of a proper field watch.

The Field Automatic Gen 2 is available in three vibrant new colorways–Ice Blue, Coho Salmon, and Basalt Grey. The dial is designed in a two-layer configuration. A sunburst central section is framed by a recessed chapter ring with stencil-cut Arabic numerals, creating a sculpted profile that plays with light and shadow. Paired with color-matched Super-LumiNova, excellent legibility is ensured.











Beneath the surface lies the self-winding Sellita SW200-1 with a power reserve of 41 hours. The Field Gen 2 features a tool-free strap change system and Formex’s patented carbon fiber clasp with micro-adjustment, ensuring a perfect fit.

Complementing its performance and design versatility are new nylon Velcro straps, crafted with a rugged weave that echoes the dial’s texture. These straps are built for durability in outdoor conditions, but transition smoothly to casual or professional settings. For a more polished look, leather strap options are also available, each compatible with the micro-adjust clasp system for maximum comfort and convenience.

“As a brand, we love to challenge expectations,” says Raphael Granito, CEO of Formex Watch SA. “For us, a field watch is not just a rugged piece of equipment–it’s a well-thought-out, refined tool designed to support a wide range of lifestyles. The Field Gen 2 reflects our ongoing commitment to delivering exceptional value, not just in materials and craftsmanship, but in the complete wearing experience.”

The new Field watches are available for pre-order starting May 22nd, 2025 at $870 on a nylon/velcro strap, or $995 on a leather strap and carbon deployant clasp, with deliveries beginning in late June 2025.

"AI can't replace freelance coders yet, but the day is coming","Freelance coders take solace: while AI models can perform a lot of the real-world coding tasks that companies contract out, they do so less effectively than a human.

At least that was the case two months ago, when researchers with Alabama-based engineering consultancy PeopleTec set out to compare how four LLMs performed on freelance coding jobs.

David Noever, chief scientist at PeopleTec, and Forrest McKee, AI/ML data scientist at PeopleTec, describe their project in a preprint paper titled, ""Can AI Freelancers Compete? Benchmarking Earnings, Reliability, and Task Success at Scale.""

""We found that there is a great data set of genuine [freelance job] bids on Kaggle as a competition, and so we thought: why not put that to large language models and see what they can do?""

Using the Kaggle dataset of Freelancer.com jobs, the authors built a set of 1,115 programming and data analysis challenges that could be evaluated using automated tests. The benchmarked programming tasks necessary to perform the freelance jobs were also assigned a monetary value, at an average of $306 (median $250), such that the paper stated that completing every freelance job could achieve a total potential value of ""roughly $1.6 million.""

Then they evaluated four models: Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen 2.5, and Mistral, the first two representing commercial models and the latter two being open source. The authors estimate that a human software engineer would be able to solve more than 95 percent of the challenges. No model did as well as that, but Claude came closest.

""Claude 3.5 Haiku narrowly outperformed GPT-4o-mini, both in accuracy and in dollar earnings,"" the paper reports, noting that Claude managed to capture about $1.52 million in theoretical payments out of the possible $1.6 million.

""It solved 877 tasks with all tests passing, which is 78.7 percent of the benchmark – a very high score for such a diverse task set. GPT-4o-mini was close behind, solving 862 tasks (77.3 percent). Qwen 2.5 was the third best, solving 764 tasks (68.5 percent). Mistral 7B lagged behind, solving 474 tasks (42.5 percent).""

Inspired by OpenAI's SWE-Lancer benchmark

Noever told The Register that the project came about in response to OpenAI's SWE-Lancer benchmark, published in February.

""They had accumulated a million dollars' worth of software tasks that were genuinely market reflective of [what companies were actually asking for],"" said Noever. ""It was unlike any other benchmark we've seen, and you know there's millions of those. And so we wanted to make it more universal beyond just ChatGPT.""

Overall, the models evaluated had much less success with the OpenAI SWE-Lancer benchmark than with the benchmarks the researchers created, possibly because the range of problems was more difficult in the OpenAI study. The payouts in OpenAI's SWE-Lancer study, with a total work value of $1 million, came to $403,325 for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, $380,350 for GPT-o1, and $303,525 for GPT-4o.

On one specific subset of tasks in the OpenAI study, the best performing model was more or less worthless.

""The best performing model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, earns $208,050 on the SWE-Lancer Diamond set and resolves 26.2 percent of IC SWE issues; however, the majority of its solutions are incorrect, and higher reliability is needed for trustworthy deployment,"" the OpenAI paper says.

Regardless, while AI models cannot replace freelance coders, Noever said people are already using them to help them fulfill freelance software engineering tasks. ""I don't know whether someone's completely automated the pipeline,"" he said. ""But I think that's coming, and I think that could be months.""

People, he said, are already using AI models to generate freelance job requirements. And those are being answered by AI models and scored by AI models. It's AI all the way down.

""It's really phenomenal to watch,"" he said.

One of the interesting findings to come out of this study, Noever said, was that open source models break at 30 billion parameters. ""That's right at the limit of a consumer GPU,"" he said. ""I think Codestral is probably one of the strongest [of these open source models], but it's not going to complete these tasks. …So as it plays out, I think it does take infrastructure. There's just no way around that."" ®",https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/22/freelance_coders_ai_work/,Technology
"Orbea’s new Rallon downhill bike is totally unique: add weights to tune the ride, choose from two back ends, and there’s a super enduro version too","The Orbea Rallon goes full gravity, the brand’s first downhill bike has interchangeable weights under the BB to smooth the ride, and a host of geometry nip and tucks

Orbea has ditched the Rallon enduro bike as we know it, instead relaunching it as a downhill race machine… one you might have spotted Tahnee Seagave pilot to victory at round one of the World Cup last weekend.

The Spanish brand says falling enduro bike sales pushed it to drop the old Rallon, as riders look more to e-bikes like its brilliant Wild, and enduro racing becomes increasingly unwatched.

In a quirky twist though, the new Rallon for 2025 will actually be available as a sort of super enduro bike, with 170mm travel and 180mm fork. So while last year Orbea riders like Martin Maes had to race downhill on a modified e-bike, this year it flipped the tables and riders can race enduro on a modified downhill rig… just not pro team riders of course, because Orbea folded its enduro team last year.

Orbea Rallon need to know

Rallon is now a downhill bike with 200mm front and rear and full carbon frame

Enduro version uses the same front triangle as the downhill bike

Gravity focussed bikes, with low antisquat for supple suspension

Weights can be added to the BB area on both enduro and DH, adding up to 600g

Bikes from £5,399 on the Enduro, up to £9,999; DH is £7,899

Choice of chainstay lengths, head angle adjustment and progression flip chip

Top end Enduro version uses Fox Live Valve Neo for pedalling efficiency

Four models in the range, one DH bike and three Enduros

We should really think of the Rallon as a downhill bike now then, and you’ll understand more when I explain the new bike’s details, which are 100% focussed on downhill performance. That already sets it apart from the best enduro mountain bikes out there, which have to pedal well (at least some of the time).

Most excitingly, the new Rallon comes with interchangeable weights to let riders alter the centre of gravity, something downhill racers have been tinkering with since the dawn of the sport. Apparently Martin Maes did this too last year, packing out the motor area on the Wild e-bike with weights to improve its performance, but I’m pretty sure the Rallon is the first to try this on a production bike.

Orbea’s done the same thing here, albeit in a more controlled and repeatable way. The weights slot into the bottom of its GravityLink (more on this in a minute), which also acts as the bottom mount for the Rallon’s shock. That’s going to let riders choose between three weights – 395g, 95g, and 93g and totalling up to 600g. And because it’s so low in the bike – actually poking through the bottom of the downtube – it dramatically changes the bike’s centre of gravity.

Orbea didn’t shout about this, but in theory it’ll also make the suspension work better. Adding weight to the frame will effectively decrease the unsprung mass ratio (wheels, fork lowers, and the back end of the bike), meaning it can slip into its travel more quickly and smoothly.

How does screwing in weight to some pre-drilled holes make the bike pedal? Who cares, when we’re talking about a downhill bike configured for gravity alone. Where it might matter is on the enduro bike version – Orbea says its really for bike park riding rather than racing, so riders might be on an uplift, but there’s always some pedalling involved in my experience.

There’s also no information on how much these two bikes weigh, either with or without their weight plates.

Orbea has a way round this though, the Rallon enduro has been built for electronically controlled suspension like RockShox Flight Attendant 2025, and specifically for use with Fox Live Valve Neo active suspension. You’ve probably heard plenty about both recently, but the whole idea is bikes can be designed with super active suspension that excels on the descents, letting AI firm up the shock for the pedalling sections.

Orbea has really leaned into this, the new bike looks more active according to the suspension kinematic charts, with just 85% antisquat – the old Rallon sat at around 120%. That’s going to make for a bike with really active suspension, probably too much if you were hoping to pedal it around places or didn’t use Live Valve.

Maximum adjustability

Orbea’s designed something called a GravityLink on the new Rallon, it’s the lower mounting point for the shock and it sits lower than the frame itself thanks to a channel cut into the downtube. Of course the idea is to drop that centre of gravity as far as possible.

More than just a low mounting point though, you can also use it to switch between a mullet and a full 29er setup on the En enduro bike by switching out the link. Orbea’s also positioned the bike’s progression flip chip down here, letting riders choose from 25% progression to 30%, something that’s all the rage in bikes this year – the Santa Cruz Vala e-bike got the ball rolling on this, and most recently we’ve seen the DJI-powered Velduro Rogue doing the same thing.

There’s no tweaking of the BB height though because Orbea hasn’t added a traditional geometry-adjust flip chip. What it has done though is popped in an angle adjust headset capable of changing the head angle by plus or minus 0.75º

Chainstay choice

This is a brilliant idea, Rallon customers can now choose which chainstay length they prefer. At the checkout you can opt for either a 442mm option or a 450mm, the former makes for a more playful ride and the latter gives you more stability at speed, Orbea says.

Usually chainstay length is either fixed, as in the case with Propain’s Spindrift CF 5 Ultimate; comes in two sizes depending on the bike size you go for, like on the YT Jeffsy Core 5; or comes in proportionally sized lengths, a la Forbidden’s new Druid CorE e-bike. The other exception is the new Specialized S-Works Turbo Levo Gen 4, which has adjustable chainstays.

Orbea reckons this is feasible because it has such an established customisable order process. All its bikes are painted and shopped from the Basque County, meaning it can make changes to the spec as you load up your basket.

Rallon DH details

The Rallon DH has 200mm travel front and rear. It comes as a mullet setup but you can opt for a full 29er at checkout. Sizing is pretty modest at 474mm on a size large, meaning it’s way smaller than the Canyon’s new 2025 Sender, which also has adjustable rate suspension. The Rallon DH isn’t as slack as the Sender either, at 63.7deg head angle.

How does it ride? Orbea says the Rallon frame is tuned for traction and confidence, rather than out and out stiffness. It also has low pedal kickback.

There’s just one downhill model on offer.

Rallon En details

The Rallon En has 170mm travel and a 180mm fork. Like the downhill bike, it’s been designed with the same gravity ethos, and as such it’s almost certain to pedal like a dog! Which is why there’s one models available with the Fox Live Valve shock. Riders on the two lower teir bikes will just have to suck it up, I guess.

The enduro bikes also get the same progressivity change as the downhill bike, but it’s a more linear platform, going from around 22.5% to 27.5%. And unlike the downhill bike, there is a high and low setting to the geometry, accessed via a flip chip in the GravityLink. This adjustment changes the head angle by 0.5º and alters bottom bracket drop by 7 mm. On top of that you get an angle adjust headset to change the head angle by plus or minus 0.75º and at stock it’s 64.5.

The enduro bike also comes in four frame sizes (S, M, L, XL) and there are three models: Rallon E-LTD, Rallon E-Team, Rallon E-10.

The Rallon Range

Orbea Rallon D-LTD £7,899 (€7,999)

The downhill bike gets a Factory level Fox 40 fork and a Float X2. Shimano handles the brakes and drivetrain, with XTR stoppers and Saint crankset and mech. The wheels are Orbea’s own OQUO MC32 Team alloy.

Orbea Rallon E-LTD £9,999 (€9,999)

The flagship enduro bike uses Fox again, with a Factory 38 up front and a Float X with Neo electronically controlled damping. It gets the same Shimano XTR brakes and Orbea wheels as the downhill bike, but a SRAM X0 drivetrain.

Orbea Rallon E-Team £6,899 (€6,999)

You get the same Factory level suspension as the E-LTD, but there’s no Neo Live Valve as standard. The wheels are the same, but the brakes and drivetrain step down to Shimano XT

Orbea Rallon E-10 £5,399 (€5,399)

Again, Orbea keeps the same Factory level suspension as the other enduro bikes. Brakes are Shimano MT6120, and the drivetrain is SLX. The wheels change too, with Race Face Arc 30s.",https://www.mbr.co.uk/news/orbea-new-rallon-downhill-bike-lets-you-add-weights-to-tune-the-ride-450110,Technology
Xiaomi launches new compact GaN charger with support for 90 W fast charging,"There's a new charging head in Xiaomi's growing accessory lineup. Called the Xiaomi ""small pudding"" charger, it features one USB-C port with support for 90 W fast charging. The starting launch price in China is CNY 149, around $21.

Fujifilm Introduces X half™ Premium Compact Digital Camera,"VALHALLA, N.Y., MAY 22, 2025 – FUJIFILM North America Corporation, Electronic Imaging Division, today announced the launch of its FUJIFILM X half™ premium compact digital camera (X half). Inspired by half-frame film cameras, best known for how they are casually used on the go, the compact size and light weight frame (8.5 ounces/240g)[1] of X half blends its modern functions with its half frame DNA to bring a new and innovative approach to content creation. Features include a dedicated smartphone application[2] and the ability to directly print to select FUJIFILM instax™[3] smartphone printers directly.

“X half is special because it rekindles our love for the compact camera and blends it with the modern sensibilities that make it easy to make a part of our everyday lives,” said Victor Ha, vice president, Electronic Imaging and Optical Devices Divisions, FUJIFILM North America Corporation. “This aligns perfectly with the growing trend of users, especially among Gen Z, who want dedicated devices to use alongside their smart devices as they try to find the balance between minimizing distractions, while documenting and sharing their lives online.”

Main Features:

The design of X half carries on the classic form and function of the FUJIFILM X Series, with its use of an aperture ring, Frame Advance Lever, and other controls to deliver a satisfying tactile response that celebrates the functionality of traditional analog photography.

The in-camera 2-in-1[4] feature allows users to combine vertical stills and movies with a simple winding of the Frame Advance Lever Users can also create 2-in-1 images with selected still image combinations through the dedicated X half smartphone app[5]. The app enables simple and intuitive editing, including changing dividing line colors and sizes or swapping left and right images.

X half is equipped with 13 Film Simulations[6] that provide a myriad of opportunities for users to emulate classic Fujifilm analog film varieties as well as three new creative filters inspired by film photography: Light Leak, which creates a slightly exposed look to the image; Halation, a halo effect that appears around light sources; and Expired Film, which mimics the grainy look of older analog film. In addition to these filters, X half also includes an additional eight filters from the instax™ instant camera series.

Film Camera Mode lets users digitize the experience of using a classic one-time use film camera. After selecting a Film Simulation to use and the a roll size of 36, 54, or 72 exposures, users will experience an analog-like experience with X half, complete with the need to wind the camera’s Frame Advance Lever after making each image, perfectly replicating the classic analog photography experience.

FUJIFILM X half app will allow users to view still images and movies in gallery or album format, directly upload images to social media, or print to an instax™ Link series[7] smartphone printer.

The camera features a new intuitive touch-screen interface that is easily navigated using the camera’s two rear LCD monitors. Smooth touch operations allow the user to intuitively change image settings and Film Simulations, providing comfortable operability in a compact body.

When creating images, X half includes a Grain Effect option that adds natural grain to the entire image to create film-like textures. Various film grain textures can be applied to change the texture of still images and movies and is also equipped with a new ""Date Stamp"" function, making it possible to imprint dates in the bottom right of images and movies like film photos.

A 1-inch back-illuminated sensor and 10.8mmF2.8 prime lens (equivalent 35mm focal length of 32mm), gives Fujifilm’s one-time-use QuickSnapTM camera enthusiasts a similar angle of view and digital way of making memories in the moment.

X half features a 3:4 aspect ratio rear LCD monitor and optical viewfinder for vertical composition of photos and videos.

Create up to 880 frames on one battery charge[8].

Pricing and Availability:

FUJIFILM X half compact digital camera is expected to be available late June 2025 at a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price of $849.99 USD and $998.99 CAD. For more information, please visit https://www.fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x-hf1/.

Samsung Galaxy S26 to have a surprise in the camera department,"Samsung's Galaxy S26 family is expected to launch in January, with or without a Plus member. Today a new rumor tells us about a surprise that Samsung is preparing for the series.

Namely, the base S26 will have a new sensor for the main camera. It will still have 50 MP resolution, but the Samsung ISOCELL GN3 sensor that's in the Galaxy S25 and has been used since the Galaxy S23 will finally be replaced, if this rumor pans out.

Samsung Galaxy S25

It's unclear what exact sensor will feature instead of it, but it is also one in the ISOCELL GN family, so it's most likely one that hasn't been made official yet.

Those are all the details supposedly outed today, and it's not a lot to go by, but it does seem like there's a chance the S26 is getting a newer and presumably better main camera.

Google’s Official Advice On Optimizing For AI Overviews & AI Mode,"Google has released new guidelines for website owners who want to excel in AI-powered search.

In a blog post, Search Advocate John Mueller shared tips for ranking in AI Overviews and AI Mode.

This guidance comes as Google moves beyond traditional “blue links” to offer more AI-driven search features.

Curious about AI in Search and your website? We just launched two new documentation pages and a blog post with some general tips on what to think about with regards to these new Search experiences. Check out the blog post at https://t.co/fYaVOfICmL — Google Search Central (@googlesearchc) May 21, 2025

AI Is Changing Search Behavior

Google noted that users now ask longer questions and follow-up queries through these new interfaces, which creates challenges and opportunities for publishers.

Mueller writes:

“The underpinnings of what Google has long advised carries across to these new experiences. Focus on your visitors and provide them with unique, satisfying content.”

Content Quality Remains Paramount

Google says creating “unique, non-commodity content” is still the foundation for success in all search formats, including AI.

The company recommends focusing on content that meets user needs instead of trying to trick the algorithm.

Google points out that AI search users ask more specific questions and follow-ups. This suggests that thorough, detailed content works especially well in these new search environments.

Technical Requirements and Page Experience

Beyond good content, Google stressed the importance of technical access.

This includes ensuring that:

Googlebot isn’t blocked

Pages load correctly

Content can be indexed

Also focus on user experience factors like mobile-friendly design, fast loading speeds, and clear main content.

Mueller writes in the blog post:

“Even the best content can be disappointing to people if they arrive at a page that’s cluttered, difficult to navigate or makes it hard to find the main information they’re seeking. Ensure that you’re providing a good page experience for those who arrive either from classic or AI search results…”

Managing Content Visibility In AI Experiences

Google confirms that current content controls work for AI search.

Publishers can use the following tags to control how their content appears:

nosnippet

data-nosnippet

max-snippet

noindex

More restrictions will limit visibility in AI results.

Multimedia Content For Multimodal Search

Google’s blog post stressed the growing importance of images and videos as Google’s AI improves.

With multimodal search, you can upload images and ask questions about them. Google recommends adding high-quality visuals to support your text content.

Ecommerce businesses should keep their Merchant Center and Business Profile information updated for better performance in visual searches.

Rethinking Success Metrics

Google shared insights about user behavior with AI search results, suggesting publishers may need to reconsider how they measure success:

“We’ve seen that when people click to a website from search results pages with AI Overviews, these clicks are higher quality, where users are more likely to spend more time on the site.”

Google suggests AI results provide better context about topics, potentially sending more engaged website visitors.

Mueller encourages site owners to look beyond just clicks and focus on more meaningful metrics like sales, signups, and engagement.

What This Means

This guidance shows that while search looks different now, Google’s main ranking principles haven’t changed.

Unique content, technical quality, and user experience still define success, even as AI changes how people use search.

The key takeaways are:

Your website meets the technical requirements for Google Search

Optimize your images and videos

Review your meta directives

Rethink how you measure traffic quality from AI search rather than just counting clicks.

Google’s full guidance, along with additional resources on AI features and generative AI content, can be found on the Google Search Central blog.

"KSE-100 surges nearly 1,000 points on investor optimism ahead of budget","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a strong rebound on Wednesday, with the benchmark KSE-100 Index closing 960 points higher as investor sentiment turned positive ahead of the upcoming federal budget.

The index settled at 119,931.45, marking a gain of 960.33 points, or 0.81%, by the end of the trading session. The rally followed a lackluster Tuesday, when the index had dropped by over 700 points amid uncertainty surrounding fiscal measures tied to Pakistan’s ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.

Eearlier in the day, buying momentum was observed across key sectors including commercial banks, oil and gas exploration companies, OMCs, power generation, and refineries. Heavyweights such as HUBCO, NRL, PSO, SNGPL, SSGC, MARI, OGDC, POL, and PPL were among the top performers, contributing significantly to the day’s gains.

At 3pm, the benchmark index was already up by 859.92 points, hovering around 119,831.04, as broad-based optimism lifted market sentiment.

The rally comes despite lingering concerns around the fiscal 2025-26 budget, as investors appear to be positioning themselves for potential pro-growth measures or clarity around the government’s fiscal path.

Analysts believe the recovery reflects technical consolidation and selective value-hunting, especially in blue-chip stocks that had been beaten down in the previous session.

The market’s performance over the next few sessions will likely remain sensitive to developments surrounding the National Fiscal Pact, IMF commitments, and taxation proposals for the new financial year.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/21/kse-100-surges-nearly-1000-points-on-investor-optimism-ahead-of-budget/,Business

Walmart is laying off corporate staff in the US to ""remove layers and complexity.""

The retailer will lay off 1,500 employees, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, reported that the layoffs were in the company's Arkansas headquarters and other offices.

The retailer's US CEO, John Furner, and global technology chief, Suresh Kumar, announced the layoffs in a Wednesday memo to corporate staff titled ""Building for the future,"" seen by BI.

""We are reshaping some teams in our Global Tech and Walmart U.S. organizations where we have identified opportunities to remove layers and complexity, speed up decision-making, and help associates innovate rapidly,"" the memo wrote.

It added that the technology team would be slimmed down to simplify its structure and ""facilitate speed and innovation.""

Aside from the layoffs, Walmart will also be opening new roles that align with its business priorities and growth strategy, the memo read.

Walmart is not the only company flattening its corporate structure. Big Tech companies, like Amazon, Google, and Intel, have been cutting middle managers to boost efficiency.

On the retail side, Amazon said in September that it would increase the ratio of its workers to supervisors by at least 15%.

The news of Walmart's layoffs comes about a week after the retailer announced in an earnings call that it would increase the prices of its products due to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Walmart said it imports a third of what it sells in the US from outside the country, such as China, Vietnam, and Mexico. Although Trump has paused his additional tariffs, Walmart's CFO said reduced tariff rates are still ""too high.""

""Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,"" CEO Doug McMillon said in the earnings call.

Walmart reported a 2.5% revenue growth in its latest quarter compared to the year before, with sales of $165.60 billion.",https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-cutting-roles-remove-layers-complexity-2025-5,Business

SECP warns public against investing in unlicensed online trading platforms,"The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has issued a warning to the public about the risks of investing through unlicensed online trading platforms, websites, and mobile applications that promise unrealistic returns on investment in stocks and other financial products. These platforms, both domestic and international, are being promoted through social media channels, offering high returns with minimal risk.

SECP has received complaints from licensed securities brokers and investors regarding platforms such as Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR), IGIL Securities Country, BMA Capital No. 108/BMAC Global Pro, WTIC World Top Investor Competition, and Aviva Securities, among others.

These platforms are attracting investors with fraudulent claims of high returns, soliciting investments through unverified mobile and web applications that appear to be legitimate trading platforms.

In order to appear credible, these fraudulent platforms misuse the names, logos, and images of reputable companies, professionals, and even regulatory authorities. They display fake dashboards showing false account balances and profit figures, while in reality, no actual trading or investment is occurring.

Initially, these platforms may allow investors to withdraw small profits, creating a sense of trust. However, this is often followed by pressure to invest larger sums. If additional funds are deposited or if an investor refuses to invest further or attempts to withdraw funds, access to their account is blocked.

The SECP reminds the public that trading in securities of listed companies and commodities in Pakistan can only be conducted through SECP-licensed securities and futures market brokers. A list of authorized brokers can be accessed through the websites of the Pakistan Stock Exchange and Pakistan Mercantile Exchange Limited.

SECP is working closely with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to report fraudulent platforms and their associated bank accounts for further action.

The public is urged not to deposit or invest funds with unlicensed entities or individuals offering unauthorized trading or investment services. Before committing to any financial arrangement, investors should verify the legitimacy of the platform or person involved. Additionally, individuals are advised against sharing personal or financial information with unverified sources on social media or messaging apps to avoid financial loss and identity theft.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/22/secp-warns-public-against-investing-in-unlicensed-online-trading-platforms/,Business

Chocolate industry faces mounting supply threats from global warming: Report warns,"Listen to article

Climate breakdown and biodiversity loss are exposing the European Union to mounting risks in its food supply chains, with cocoa imports at the heart of what experts have called a “chocolate crisis,” a new report said on Tuesday.

The analysis by UK-based consultancy Foresight Transitions found that more than two-thirds of key food imports into the EU in 2023 came from countries ill-prepared for climate change.

The study mapped Eurostat trade data against environmental readiness scores from the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index and biodiversity rankings from the UK’s Natural History Museum.

It identified six key commodities – cocoa, coffee, soy, rice, wheat and maize – as particularly vulnerable.

Cocoa stood out as the most exposed. The EU sourced nearly 97% of its cocoa imports from countries with poor climate preparedness and 77% from nations with degraded biodiversity.

“These aren’t just abstract threats,” said Camilla Hyslop, lead author of the report. “They are already affecting prices, availability, and jobs — and it’s only getting worse.”

Most cocoa comes from West African nations, where rising temperatures, unpredictable rains, and biodiversity decline are combining to stress farming systems.

The report argued that large chocolate manufacturers should invest in climate adaptation and biodiversity protection — not just as a sustainability effort, but as a risk management strategy.

“This is not an act of altruism,” the report noted, “but a vital derisking exercise.” Ensuring fair prices for farmers, it added, would allow investment in climate resilience on the ground.

EU maize and wheat imports were also heavily reliant on countries with medium to low environmental readiness, according to the study. Maize was especially vulnerable, with 90% of imports coming from countries with poor climate scores.

Environmental experts warn the trend undermines the EU’s assumption of food security.

“This paints an extremely worrying picture,” said Paul Behrens, a food systems expert at the University of Oxford. “The EU likes to think of itself as self-sufficient, but the data show deep dependencies on fragile ecosystems abroad.”

The report, commissioned by the European Climate Foundation, also flagged concerns around coffee, soy and rice.

Uganda, for example, which supplied 10% of the EU’s coffee last year, scored low on climate readiness and biodiversity intactness.

Ugandan coffee farmer advocate Joseph Nkandu called for increased access to international climate finance to help smallholders cope with erratic weather patterns.

“The weather in Uganda is no longer predictable,” he said. “Our coffee bushes are suffering from prolonged dry spells and unseasonal rains.”

Oxford researcher Marco Springmann, who was not involved in the report, said deeper reform of food systems was needed.

“Resilience isn't just about stabilising current supply chains,” he said. “We also need to move away from overreliance on crops like soy, which are primarily used to feed livestock.”",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2547067/chocolate-industry-faces-mounting-supply-threats-from-global-warming-repor,Business

Currency exchange rates play a vital role in the global economy. They affect the price of imports and exports, influencing trade balances. A stronger currency makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive, which can impact a country’s trade deficit or surplus. Additionally, businesses and investors monitor exchange rates closely, as fluctuations can affect profitability, especially for companies operating internationally.

Currency exchange allows businesses and governments to trade goods and services across borders.

Exporters and importers convert foreign currencies to their local currencies, enabling smooth transactions.

Meanwhile, remittances from the United Kingdom recorded at $535.3 million during April 2025, down by 22% compared to $683.8 million in March 2025. When it comes to year on year basis, the remittances were increased by 33%.

VIS reaffirms credit ratings of Feroze1888 Mills amid stable outlook,"KARACHI- VIS Credit Rating Company Limited has reaffirmed the entity ratings of Feroze1888 Mills Limited, a leading textile manufacturer in Pakistan, according to a stock exchange filing by the company on Thursday.

The rating action was disclosed under Section 96 and Section 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and communicated to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) through a material information notice.

Honda Atlas annual profit rises 16% to Rs2.71bn as sales rebound in FY25,"KARACHI: Honda Atlas Cars (Pakistan) Limited (PSX: HCAR) reported a 16.08% increase in after-tax profit, reaching Rs2.71 billion [EPS: Rs18.97] for the year ended March 31, 2025, compared to Rs2.33 billion [EPS: Rs16.34] in the previous year. The company also announced a final cash dividend of Rs8 per share, or 80%.

This marks a modest recovery in profitability compared to FY24, when earnings were under pressure from inflation, auto financing restrictions, and import constraints. The turnaround was driven largely by a 41.75% surge in revenue, which climbed to Rs78.07 billion from Rs55.07 billion in the same period last year (SPLY), amid an improving supply chain and easing monetary conditions.

Gross profit increased by 47.82% to Rs6.66 billion, as cost of sales rose in line with revenue by 41.21% to Rs71.4 billion. However, the company faced significant pressure from non-core income streams, as other income plummeted by 56.1% to Rs988.73 million—down from Rs2.25 billion last year, when elevated returns on cash holdings had boosted earnings.

Administrative and distribution expenses also weighed on margins, rising 27.66% and 23.69% YoY respectively, reflecting higher marketing spend and inflationary pressures. On the positive side, finance costs declined 14.54% to Rs1.04 billion, indicating improved cash flow and lower reliance on debt.

Honda Atlas paid Rs565.63 million in taxes during the year, up 35.09% from FY24.

Participating Airports

Four major airports across both countries will participate in the trial:

In Japan:

In South Korea:

Gimpo International Airport in Seoul (GMP)

Gimhae International Airport in Busan (PUS)

These airports serve as critical connection points between the neighbouring countries, handling significant passenger volumes daily.

The Immigration Services Agency explained that this special measure commemorates the 60th anniversary of normalised diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.

The initiative represents one of several collaborative efforts to strengthen ties and facilitate greater people-to-people exchange between the nations.

Bilateral Relations

This immigration initiative follows a period of improving relations between the two countries after years of historical tensions. By enhancing travel convenience, both governments acknowledge the importance of people-to-people exchanges in strengthening bilateral ties.

The priority lanes program, while currently limited to a one-month trial, could potentially serve as a model for future immigration cooperation between the countries if successful. Tourism officials from both nations will likely monitor the initiative closely to evaluate its effectiveness and consider possible expansion or permanent implementation.

As travellers begin utilising these expedited lanes in June, the program stands as a tangible symbol of the evolving relationship between Japan and South Korea, prioritising practical cooperation and enhanced connectivity between their populations.

May 22 (Reuters) - Indian benchmark indices fell on Thursday, mirroring global losses as U.S. fiscal worries and rising Treasury yields weighed on investor sentiment.

Other Asian markets also declined on the day, with the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index (.MIAPJ0000PUS) , opens new tab losing 0.9%. European markets also traded lower, ahead of the crucial vote in the U.S. on President Donald Trump's tax bill.

Investors are worried the new tax and spending bill could add about $3.8 trillion to the $36 trillion U.S. debt pile.

Concerns over mounting debt and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating last week pushed longer-dated Treasury yields to 18-month highs.

Rising Treasury yields make bonds more attractive to foreign investors, driving out capital from stocks in emerging markets such as India.

""The domestic market does not appear to be on strong legs as uncertainties have increased significantly,"" said Sandeep Bagla, CEO of Trust Mutual Fund.

India's Nifty, which rose 4.2% last week, helped by foreign inflows, ceasefire with Pakistan and U.S.-China trade truce, has lost 1.6% so far this week.

""While some investors expect domestic flows to continue supporting the market, others remain concerned about whether economic and earnings recovery can sustain the uptrend,"" Bagla said.

All 13 major sectoral indices logged losses.

U.S. dollar falls for third day amid tax bill uncertainty,"The U.S. dollar fell for a third consecutive day against a range of currencies on Wednesday amid growing concerns over the Trump administration’s tax cut and spending bill, with Republicans remaining divided over key aspects of the legislation.

President Donald Trump met with House Republicans but failed to secure support from party holdouts who argue the bill does not sufficiently reduce spending, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.

As the bill impasse continues, the euro strengthened 0.5% against the dollar, reaching $1.1339, its highest level in two weeks. Investor sentiment shifted away from U.S. safe-haven assets, driven in part by concerns about the country’s rising debt levels, which analysts estimate could increase by $3 trillion to $5 trillion due to the proposed tax bill.

Meanwhile, cautiousness over U.S. officials potentially seeking a weaker dollar as part of independent trade negotiations during the Group of Seven finance ministers meetings in Canada added to the currency’s pressure. Recent developments in the global tariff conflict have slowed, though talks with close allies such as Tokyo and Seoul appear to have lost momentum, fueling ongoing uncertainty.

The dollar also weakened against the yen, which rose 0.6% to 143.64 yen, boosted by a sharp increase in Japanese government bond yields. Yields on 30-year Japanese government bonds reached new records following a disappointing auction, raising concerns over upcoming debt sales.

The rise in Japanese yields has narrowed the gap with U.S. Treasury yields, reducing the appeal of holding the dollar.

In addition, the yen, Swiss franc, and gold gained after reports emerged that the United States has gathered intelligence suggesting Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, heightening geopolitical tensions. The recent Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign debt rating, while having limited market impact, has contributed to reduced confidence in U.S. assets as safe havens, with the dollar declining against all major currencies so far this year.

Market participants are also focused on upcoming U.S.-Japan discussions, with Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato expected to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later this week. Kato emphasized that exchange rate talks will be grounded in a mutual understanding that excessive volatility is undesirable.

"Gold prices rise to 2-week high on US debt worries, Middle East uncertainty","Investing.com-- Gold prices rose in Asian trade on Thursday, extending recent gains as demand for safe havens was buoyed by persistent concerns over high U.S. debt levels and the passage of a tax cut bill.

Bullion was buoyed by recent reports of Israel planning an attack on Iran, although the announcement of more nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington helped quell fears of an immediate attack.

But gold retained most of its gains from earlier this week, as reports said Israel was standing ready to attack Iran if talks with the United States broke down.

Spot gold rose 0.7% to $3,338.04 an ounce, while gold futures for June rose 0.8% to $3,339.20/oz by 01:27 ET (05:27 GMT).

Gold buoyed by US debt concerns

Gold was largely underpinned this week by heightened concerns over stretched U.S. debt levels, especially after Moody’s cited the matter as a key motivator for its recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.

Traders were seen dumping U.S. Treasuries and the dollar in favor of gold and other safe havens, with Treasury yields rising sharply this week. The U.S. Treasury saw soft demand for a $16 billion sale of 20-year bonds on Wednesday.

Focus was on a House of Representatives floor vote on a sweeping tax-cut and spending bill, which could occur this week after a Republican-controlled house committee approved the bill for vote.

Analysts argue that the proposed tax cuts and increased border and defense spending could further increase the U.S.’ debt pile, ramping up fiscal risks for the country. This comes against the backdrop of continued uncertainty over the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which was a key driver of gold’s gains this year.

Other precious metals rose on a softer dollar. Platinum futures rose 0.4% to $1,082.20 an ounce, while silver futures rose 0.7% to $33.873/oz.

Copper upbeat with focus on China stimulus

Among industrial metals, copper prices advanced on Thursday, benefiting from a softer dollar and as traders continued to cheer signs of more stimulus in top importer China.

Benchmark copper futures on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.2% to $9,545.50 a ton, while U.S. copper futures rose 1.3% to $4.7175 a pound.

Copper was sitting on strong gains this week after China cut its benchmark loan prime rate to further loosen monetary policy and support the economy.

This week’s cut increased optimism that China will release more measures to support growth, which could in turn buoy the country’s appetite for copper.

Trade dialogue between China and the U.S. also remained in focus, amid some signs of strain after a truce last week.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-prices-rise-2-week-061456563.html,Business

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo

May 22 (Reuters) - These robots don't break into a jig or jump, but their ability to do single tasks cheaply and efficiently is attracting investor dollars as focus shifts to function from flash.

Far from the sleek humanoids of science fiction that are meant for complex and adaptive work, boxy and utilitarian robots - some the size of industrial tool chests - are built to handle tasks such as hauling parts, collecting trash or inspecting equipment.

Sign up here.

Interest has been rising in such specialized robots as they offer a clear path to profitability, given the stress on automation across industries, including retail, defense and waste management, company executives, analysts and investors told Reuters.

In contrast, makers of general-purpose humanoids are still grappling with technical challenges, including limited training data and difficulty operating in unpredictable real-world environments, to make them viable.

Data from PitchBook shows robotics companies globally raised $2.26 billion in the first quarter of 2025, with more than 70% of that capital funneled into firms making task-focused machines.

The funding reflects a broader global race to robot supremacy. From Shenzhen to Silicon Valley, companies are trying to develop machines that can take on physical work, with China emerging as a major player thanks to ample government support.

The push has been fueled by advances in chip technology, which has enabled more sophisticated AI models that allow robots to perceive, process and react without needing remote servers.

""With Nvidia's Orin NX, we were able to put far more AI models on the edge than we could earlier,"" said Saurabh Chandra, CEO of Ati Motors, referring to Nvidia's high-performance AI chip designed to run multiple machine learning models directly on edge devices such as robots, without relying on the cloud.

Based in India's tech capital of Bengaluru, Ati Motors makes robots that can tug around more than 1,000 kilograms on factory floors and industrial sites. Ati Motors has deployed hundreds of robots across more than 50 factories globally, including at Hyundai (011760.KS) , opens new tab , Forvia (FRVIA.PA) , opens new tab , and Bosch, with its flagship Sherpa Tug logging over 500,000 kilometers in operation.

In healthcare, Austin-based Diligent Robotics is seeing traction with Moxi, a robot that handles non-patient-facing tasks such as delivering supplies, medications and lab samples.

""We've found that by solving a very specific problem in a high-need area like healthcare, we can create a sustainable business model,"" Diligent Robotics CEO Andrea Thomaz said, adding Moxi has reached product-level profitability.

Humanoid startups secure just a slice of VC capital as robotics funding soars - Venture Capital investors continue to lean towards task-focused robots

HUMANOID CHALLENGES

The interest comes as general-purpose humanoids face challenges such as teaching machines to navigate unpredictable environments and developing sophisticated reasoning abilities.

Unlike generative AI, which is trained on vast online datasets of text, images and audio, the data available to develop humanoid robots is far more limited. These machines must learn by interacting with the physical world and training on datasets focused on tasks such as stacking boxes.

Firms like Figure AI, which aims to ship 100,000 humanoid robots over the next four years, rely on advanced AI to process real-time sensory data. That means such robots are mostly confined to controlled environments such as car factories.

The cost of humanoids is also far higher than task-specific robots. Components such as cameras and lidar sensors can push manufacturing costs for humanoid robots to between $50,000 and $200,000 per unit, compared with $5,000 to $100,000 for task-specific machines, according to industry executives and a market study by startup Standard Bots.

""(True) general-purpose robots have not really been invented yet,"" said Marc Theermann, strategy chief at Boston Dynamics, adding that ""if somebody claims that they are commercially finding a general-purpose robot, they are over-promising and they will under-deliver.""

While the company's Atlas robot has made headlines with viral clips of it leaping, flipping and dancing, Theermann said the value currently lies in targeted designs. Its four-legged robot, Spot, excels in hazardous industrial inspections, a narrow but lucrative niche.

Era Ventures has backed ViaBot, whose autonomous machines manage trash collection in parking lots. Parkway Venture Capital has diversified its bets between Siera AI's forklift automation and Figure AI's humanoid ambitions.

""You'll see a transition where there will be robots built for a task doing something very useful, very cost-effectively,"" said Raja Ghawi, Partner at Era Ventures. ""And as that gets better, people will realize there is a good reason to have a full humanoid.""

Why The Dollar Must Fall: Two Charts You Need To See,"Falling dollars getty

What follows is about trying to make money – or at least preserve capital – in these unpredictable times. It is not an attempt at political critique. Sadly, the days when you could simply look at a balance sheet to decide whether to invest are long gone. Today, everything pivots heavily on the output of the White House.

A few weeks back, I wrote about how disastrous U.S. tariffs would be. The market melted down, Treasury bonds wobbled, and disaster seemed imminent. Then the White House paused its course, kicked the can down the road, and the market reversed as if tariffs were off the table. Then, on May 14th, China tariffs were rolled back to a level lower than under Biden (around 20%), generally down to 10%. (News sources are mixed, with the BBC claiming 30%.)

So, tariffs on China have imploded – from 145% down to 10% – for a 90-day truce.

Let’s pull back. What was the point of these wild tariffs in the first place? Wherever they were ultimately set, high tariffs were supposed to rebalance trade and eliminate the U.S. trade deficit. But there was more to it than that: the broader goal was to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. – to reestablish it as the “workshop of the world,” or at least a workshop of the world, with all the geopolitical implications that come with it.

Doing that via tariffs might work, though history would offer a healthy dose of skepticism. Still, you can see how the idea holds some merit – if you’re willing to risk massive economic pain. The financial markets, however, gave the idea a resounding “nope,” threatening to bring the roof down.

So here we are, in a truce with tariffs lower than they were under Biden – a far cry from the rhetoric of just a few weeks ago. If tariffs remain at these levels, they may actually worsen the trade deficit.

What’s Next for the August Deadline?

In the short term, a U.S. restocking blitz from China is likely. It takes about 70 days to ship goods from China to the U.S., so companies can replenish inventories before the 90-day window closes. This pushes any supply chain shock from high tariffs further down the road. We might see only a minor blip in goods arriving at U.S. ports. That means the inflation wave from previous tariffs will be limited – buying some time.

So, what then?

There are two roads ahead:

Plan A: Reimpose high tariffs and return to the old trade war path.

Plan B: Maintain the new, lower tariffs – perhaps even lower than the previous 20%, keeping them around 10% (this is Trump, after all).

Under Plan A, the stock market collapses, we slide into recession or even depression, inflation surges, and the only thing missing is the zombie apocalypse (though even that might feel plausible). The U.S. walks through economic hell to revive its manufacturing muscle. It could be epic – but probably not in a good way.

Under Plan B, it’s a “go for growth” scenario. Here's the logic:

America doesn’t want low-wage jobs – it wants the kind created in Silicon Valley. The goal is to make all the high-end products domestically, leaving low-end consumer goods to the rest of the world. To do that, the U.S. needs growth – lots of it. And while no one will say it out loud, that implies low interest rates, a weaker dollar, and elevated inflation. Tariffs already cause some inflation, so that part’s a wash.

You also don’t need to slash and burn government spending – just prevent it from growing too fast. If economic growth rises, it outpaces expenditures and shrinks the deficit (at least in theory). Clinton pulled off a surplus during the dot-com boom, so this idea has precedent – much more than tariffs ever had. Still, this is the same old strategy that eventually lands us back in fiscal trouble. Yet it’s the strategy that gave the U.S. the highest GDP per capita (in dollars), even while bleeding trade and fiscal deficits.

Fixing the trade deficit by weakening the dollar ends up looking a lot like a tariff.

Take a look at a long-term dollar chart – say, against the yen. The dollar is strong, making it easy for Japan to export to the U.S.

The USD/JPY chart Credit: ADVFN

If the dollar drops by a third (a historically sustainable and palatable level), import prices rise by 33% – which acts like a tariff and suppresses demand. At the same time, U.S. exports become 30% cheaper, boosting competitiveness. If China and Europe revalue their currencies too, trade flows could shift dramatically.

The USD/EUR chart Credit: ADVFN

But even if they don’t, the U.S. can still move the needle. Lower interest rates and, if necessary, QE can achieve the same outcome. This is, of course, currency manipulation – something every country does but denies. If the U.S. starts the game, others will join in a reflationary race. That’s still preferable to a full-blown trade war… maybe.

So, in Plan B, you get:

Economic boom

Inflation

Surging asset prices (real estate and stocks)

Another boom-bust cycle, turbocharged by asset inflation

Let’s just hope inflation doesn’t go full 1970s.

Of course, this hinges on the Federal Reserve playing along. Faced with a trade war-induced meltdown, what options would the Fed really have?

But Wait – Plan C

Talk big, do little.

This means ongoing confusion, chronic uncertainty, and a generally bearish undertone.

Naturally, there’s an entire alphabet of “what ifs,” but Plans A and B are front and center. We can track their likelihood by watching the markets:

If the market tanks: Plan A.

If the dollar falls: Plan B.

If it’s Plan A, hold gold and cash – wait it out.

If it’s Plan B, go long stocks – and if you fear inflation, hedge with gold or your favorite inflation-resistant assets.

Uncertainty is the mother of unstable money supply – and therefore, the mother of inflation. And we have oodles of uncertainty ahead. Strap in for a wild ride as the global economy sprints toward growth. But make no mistake: unpredictability is not good for good outcomes.

Trump’s ‘Little Problem’ With Tim Cook Is a Big One for Apple,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has become a frequent target for attacks by President Donald Trump, a factor that has held the stock back as other big tech companies have rebounded over the past month.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The iPhone maker was the biggest company in the world at the start of May, but since then, it’s fallen to third, behind Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp.

It underperformed again Wednesday, falling in a broadly negative session after OpenAI announced the acquisition of a startup co-founded by Apple veteran Jony Ive that is focused on artificial intelligence-fueled hardware. The prospect of shiny new alternatives to Apple’s devices added to concerns about the company’s struggle to compete in the AI arms race.

But a more unusual threat stems from Trump’s focus on the company over its global manufacturing process. Earlier this month, Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook,” and said that he had asked Apple’s chief executive officer to stop building plants in India.

“It’s a red flag for me that Trump continues to single out Apple and seems to have something against them,” said Randy Hare, director of equity research at Huntington National Bank. “It doesn’t mean that Trump is going to do anything more, but you can’t predict what’s going to happen, and that makes me cautious.”

Shares fell 0.5% on Thursday, on track for their seventh straight negative session.

Political risk has been a driver of markets overall this year, as seen in Wednesday’s stock selloff over concerns about the ballooning deficit, an issue that prompted Moody’s to downgrade the US credit rating. Investors are also monitoring the latest developments regarding the Trump administration’s signature tax bill.

Apple’s fate has been more closely tied to the trade war and it has avoided the worst-case scenario that seemed plausible last month. While shares saw incredible tariff-related volatility and have recently been rangebound, the stock is still up 16% from the low it hit after the tariffs were first announced in early April.

Not long after, the Trump administration exempted key categories of electronics — including smartphones and computers — from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, and the US and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on each other’s products.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-little-problem-tim-cook-115502597.html,Business
Oil prices dip as U.S. crude and fuel inventories rise unexpectedly,"Oil prices slipped on Wednesday following the release of unexpected increases in U.S. crude and fuel inventories, dampening market sentiment ahead of the U.S. summer driving season, a period typically associated with higher fuel demand.

Brent crude futures declined by 12 cents to $65.26 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 9 cents to $61.94.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration revealed crude stockpiles rose by 1.3 million barrels last week, alongside increases of approximately 800,000 barrels in gasoline inventories and 600,000 barrels in distillate supplies. These inventory builds caught the market off guard, leading to a downturn in oil futures despite earlier gains fueled by geopolitical concerns.

Earlier reports had suggested that Israel might be preparing a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, raising fears of potential supply disruptions in the Middle East. Iran, a major oil exporter and the third-largest producer within OPEC, ships over 1.5 million barrels per day, and any escalation in conflict could threaten these exports.

Concerns also remain that Iran might retaliate by obstructing tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical passageway for crude shipments from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates.

Should tensions escalate, disruptions in the range of 500,000 barrels per day could occur, though market participants expect OPEC+ to respond swiftly to stabilize supply. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan has increased its oil production by 2% in May, defying calls from OPEC+ to curb output, adding further complexity to the global supply dynamics.

Diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Iran continue, with multiple rounds of talks this year focused on Iran’s nuclear program. However, recent statements from U.S. officials and Iran’s Supreme Leader suggest that a breakthrough remains distant, contributing to the ongoing uncertainty influencing oil markets.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/21/oil-prices-dip-as-u-s-crude-and-fuel-inventories-rise-unexpectedly/,Business

Gold daily market movers: Rally extends amid heightened US yields and hawkish Fed commentary

US Treasury bond yields have risen due to Moody’s actions with the US 10-year Treasury note yield at around 4.477%, up almost three basis points (bps). Meanwhile, US real yields are also up three bps at 2.117%.

The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the US currency against six others, falls 0.21% to 100.17. Although it remains off daily lows of 100.06, traders seeking safety have moved to the yellow metal.

St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said that if inflation expectations become de-anchored, the Fed's policy should be centered on price stability. He said that there is uncertainty if tariffs would have a temporary or persistent effect on inflation.

Last week, Moody’s, the international rating agency, downgraded the US government rating from AAA to Aa1. They highlighted that more than a decade of inaction by successive US administrations and Congress has contributed to the country’s worsening fiscal position, raising concerns over long-term debt sustainability.

Given the backdrop, major banks are convinced that the yellow metal will continue to rally heading into next year. Goldman Sachs forecasts Bullion to average $3,700 an ounce by year-end, then reach $4,000 by mid-2026.

FXStreet calculates Gold prices in United Arab Emirates by adapting international prices (USD/AED) to the local currency and measurement units. Prices are updated daily based on the market rates taken at the time of publication. Prices are just for reference and local rates could diverge slightly.

Gold FAQs Why do people invest in Gold? Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government. Who buys the most Gold? Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves. How is Gold correlated with other assets? Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal. What does the price of Gold depend on? The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

BofA joins peers in lifting rupee forecast; sees 84,"By Nimesh Vora

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Bofa Research expects the Indian rupee to strengthen to 84 per U.S. dollar by December 2025 from a prior forecast of 87, joining peers in turning more bullish on the currency amid improving capital inflows and trade engagement.

BofA expects the rupee to track broader weakness in the U.S. dollar and be supported by stable domestic fundamentals, it said on Thursday, adding that the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) pro-growth stance is likely to attract renewed equity inflows,

The RBI cut rates in February and April this year to support growth, with traders pricing in a near-certain 25 basis-point reduction at the June meeting.

A potential revival in economic activity could boost foreign interest in Indian stocks. After pulling out $13.5 billion from equities in the January-March period, foreign investors have already pumped in $2.5 billion so far this quarter.

An improvement in India’s terms of trade, aided by lower oil prices, is expected to keep the current account deficit within a manageable range. Additionally, while India was flagged by the U.S. as a potential target for higher reciprocal tariffs, ongoing efforts to secure a trade agreement have helped ease those concerns to an extent, BofA said.

""These factors are likely to support INR strength through the remainder of the year.""

BofA's forecast aligns with projections from Goldman Sachs and MUFG Bank.

MUFG, which had earlier forecast the rupee at 87.5, revised its target about three weeks ago to 84. Around the same time, ANZ upgraded its December forecast for the rupee to 86 from earlier expectations of 88.5.

""We see a mild appreciation bias for the rupee driven by dollar softness, an improving domestic growth outlook, the return of capital flows, and lower commodity prices,"" said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank.

CoreWeave's stock is up 200% in a month. Here's why it's so polarizing.,"By Laila Maidan

CoreWeave bulls are celebrating a new customer win, but bearish positions have built up and the company is still losing money

Shares of CoreWeave Inc. have tripled over the past month, and they're up 34% this week alone. On the surface, investors seem to be expressing optimism over the company's better-than-expected earnings, latest customer acquisition of Google and upsized debt deal. But the stock is also a prime candidate for a short squeeze, given how crowded bearish positions have become in recent weeks.

CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV), which went public on March 28, already has an impressive lineup of lineup of data-center-infrastructure customers, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), OpenAI and now Alphabet Inc.'s Google (GOOGL) (GOOG). Despite that, short positions continue to build up. Based on data from S3 Partners, 6.7 million shares had been shorted over the last 30 days, leading to an over 104% increase in total shares shorted. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners, noted that existing shorts are paying a fee of about 17%. New shorts are paying between 20% to 30%, making it an expensive position to hold.

Below is a chart that shows how steeply short interest as a percentage of the stock's float rose from April 15 to May 20.

While investor optimism sent the stock's price rallying, there are positions on the other side of the trade. Dusaniwsky noted that it's a crowded stock that's now ""very squeezable"" with a ""squeeze"" score of 100, the highest score on a scale from zero to 100.

""In 999 instances out of 1,000 situations, if you told me that Google and OpenAI signed up as customers and Nvidia was a shareholder, that would be a good thing,"" said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. ""So I definitely understand how the stock got this high. What we're arguing is that this is the one in 1,000, where those things are actually, not very good.""

In other words, investors who took short positions had good reason to do so. Luria noted that the big issue with CoreWeave is that its borrowing costs are too high. He estimated that the company's return on assets, which measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit, is at 5%, while the interest the company is paying on the debt to purchase some of those assets is more than 10%.

In the short term, that may be acceptable for a smaller company that's spending money to ramp up its business. But it's not great news for CoreWeave. The business isn't a small one at this point, he noted. CoreWeave is expected to generate more than $5 billion in revenue this year and the company already has over 30 data centers in operation. So if CoreWeave isn't already able to make money at this point, it's hard to imagine it will be able to down the line, he said. The company reported a first-quarter adjusted net loss of $150 million, compared with $24 million a year ago.

This is especially the case when considering that CoreWeave's customers are also its direct competitors and are using its cloud storage as excess capacity when they're tight on internal capacity, Luria noted. This means they're not expected to be long-term customers because they can walk away once they have increased their capacity, in his view.

Ten disruptors taking aim at modern warfare,"As global alliances shift and technology redefines the battlefield, Europe’s defence industry is stepping up to offer smart new solutions. Here are a few of the innovations currently on our radar.

The heat is on for Europe to start taking its own defence and security more seriously, with the US signalling that it will no longer be the guarantor of peace on the continent. European defence stocks are soaring as investors watch budgets track up for the first time in years. Countries claim that they want to “buy European” – yet those shopping around for new kit soon realise that while there are big local players such as BAE Systems, Thales and Dassault Aviation, the ecosystem of defence start-ups is less developed in Europe than in the US. There’s clearly some catching-up to do.

Tekever’s intelligence software Atlas

Here, Monocle rounds up 10 firms that could become the vanguard of the continent’s defence industry. Whether they’re creators of armour, walkie-talkies or counter-drone technology, the following have caught the attention of venture capitalists, helping them to scale up to meet the moment.

Engineers at work AR3 drone

1.

The up-and-comer

Tekever

Portugal

Portuguese defence firm Tekever started out building software before shifting into drone technology in 2010. According to its CEO, Ricardo Mendes, those beginnings planted the seeds of its success. “Good software companies are agile to their core,” he says. “Just look at your phone. You get a new update every two to three weeks and, if you don’t, it starts to lag. That attitude to development is how we approach our work.”

In 2018, Tekever signed its first contract with the European Maritime Safety Agency to run drone patrols over European waters, collaborating with Collecte Localisation Satellites, France’s space agency subsidiary. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022 boosted business as demand for hi-tech reconnaissance drones soared. Tekever has since expanded its Portuguese presence, rolled out a UK-based manufacturing hub and picked up investment from the Nato Innovation Fund and early SpaceX backer Baillie Gifford.

Phil Hanson, Tekever’s deputy head of defence strategy Kitted out for the job

When Monocle visits Tekever’s facility in Wales, which opened in 2023, employees are hard at work on its AR3 surveillance drone. “We manage the entire process,” says Tekever’s deputy head of defence strategy, Phil Hanson. “The AR3 drone being used in Ukraine has gone through more than 100 iterations. We take feedback from customers 24/7, allowing us to update our products rapidly. That’s pretty much unique in the market.”

Tekever might be an emerging firm but it has illustrious neighbours. Nextdoor to the Wales facility is French defence giant Thales; from a meeting room, we catch sight of a 6.5-metre WK450 drone that Thales produced with Israeli military technology company Elbit Systems. That project was retired from service earlier this year amid rocketing costs – well before its scheduled end-of-service date of 2042. “There is a growing frustration with the present way of doing things,” says Hanson, who believes a fresh approach is needed – and which Tekever, with its agility, cost-effective mindset and urge to improve, is practising.

Drones on the factory floor

Mendes also believes this is a time of great opportunity for European defence firms such as his. “The nature of war and defence is no longer compatible with long development and procurement cycles,” he says. “The market model has changed and we’re moving away from defence monoliths. What Europe needs now are companies that can move fast, scale up and work together in an ecosystem.”

The delivery guys

Arx Robotics

Germany

Last-mile delivery is a sector that’s full of opportunities, whether that’s doorstep drop-offs or getting military supplies to the front line while under fire. During his time at the start-up incubator lab at Bundeswehr University Munich, which is run by the German Armed Forces, former army officer Marc Wietfeld wondered whether robots could be put to this dangerous task.

As Wietfeld explored the robots’ potential for logistics, he sought to raise funds for a large prototype. In March 2022 he teamed up with Max Wied, another army officer with a background in finance. Stefan Roebel, who cut his teeth in business at Ebay and fashion retailer Asos, joined in 2023. A few years later, the company they founded, Arx Robotics, has already broken several records, including for funding and deliveries to Ukraine, where its robots now carry ammunition, sensors or aerial drones into combat and wounded soldiers out of harm’s way.

business development

The success of Arx’s Gereon robots is down to their autonomous capabilities, which are facilitated by a mix of artificial-intelligence software, night-vision stereo cameras for a 3D view, and thermal and lidar sensors for obstacle recognition. Crucially, they are also inexpensive to build, as the software easily integrates with third-party products and the hardware is mostly made up of off-the-shelf industry components. Initially, Arx set the cost of a robot at between €30,000 and €150,000, depending on features and sensors. Today, says Wietfeld, “They cost a sixth of our cheapest competitor.”

Arx robots have all-terrain tracks, a maximum speed of 30km/h and a range of 40km. The modular mounted section of the robot can be swapped out by hand in just two minutes and can be modified to carry a stretcher for evacuations, sensors for reconnaissance, a launcher for aerial drones or a basket for supplies of up to 500kg. The firm rapidly attracted supporters and capital. In September 2023, Project A, a Berlin-based technology VC company, invested €1.15m. Nine months later, Discovery Ventures, another VC from Berlin, and the Nato Innovation Fund (see below), along with Project A, put forward joint seed investment of €9m – the largest seed round for a European defence-technology company to date. In early 2025, Arx sent 30 robots to Ukraine. The delivery from Germany was the biggest autonomous ground fleet provided by any Nato country.

Since then, Arx has established a 10-person team in Kyiv to oversee maintenance and production and gather feedback. It found that limiting the size of the robots to about 1.3 metres makes them harder to detect and more easily deployable by civilian vehicles.

Arx is increasing production in Germany and Ukraine and setting up in the UK, and recently inaugurated Europe’s largest plant for unmanned ground systems in Erding, near Munich, which is becoming a hub for defence start-ups. In April, Arx secured a second funding round of €31m to quintuple its production capacity and raise its workforce from 60 to at least 100 employees by the end of 2025.”

Investing in defence

European venture capital has in the past been wary of investing in start-ups that make products with links to warfare. But the invasion of Ukraine changed that. According to a 2024 report from the Nato Innovation Fund and Dealroom, European investment in the defence, security and resilience sector totalled €4.5bn in 2024, an all-time high. Here are five funds to know. 01

MD One Ventures

Europe’s first VC firm dedicated to national-security start-ups has backed everything from quieter jet engines to AI. 02

Nato Innovation Fund

Backed by 24 allies, this fund has deployed more than €1bn in hypersonic systems and next-generation communications. 03

Scalewolf

The Lithuania-based accelerator invests in dual-use technologies with defence as well as commercial applications. 04

National Security Strategic Investment Fund

This UK government-supported venture fund has backed breakthrough companies in drones and next-generation defence manufacturing. 05

Hyperion Fund

This Spanish fund launched in 2024 with €150m growth equity and focuses on aerospace, cybersecurity and AI-related defence firms.

The frontier steward

Frankenburg Technologies

Estonia

Being “mission-driven” has become a cliché among start-ups – jargon trotted out by ambitious founders and written in pitch decks. At Frankenburg Technologies, a defence start-up based in Tallinn, Estonia, the phrase feels more like a battle cry. “We are a single-use company with a single mission: to defend Europe and equip the free world with the technology to win the war,” says Kusti Salm, the firm’s CEO. As he speaks, he presents a prototype of the company’s first product: a missile designed to shoot down drones such as the low-cost Iranian-made Shahed deployed by Russian forces in Ukraine. In contrast to the traditional military-industrial model – which is heavy, slow and expensive – Frankenburg promises guided-missile systems that are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster to produce.

Kusti Salm, Frankenburg’s CEO

Estonia, once occupied by the USSR, now has more start-ups per capita than any other country in Europe. Frankenburg represents a convergence of that technology-forward spirit with a frontier nation’s understanding of regional security. The company was launched in 2024 by a formidable trio – a former high-ranking defence official in Estonia’s military, a veteran rocket scientist and one of Estonia’s wealthiest entrepreneurs – and has moved with the urgency of a start-up. In just a few months, its valuation has tripled to €150m. Several funding rounds have been announced, with plans to scale operations across Europe. The company is establishing research and manufacturing facilities in Latvia and opening a new headquarters in the UK. The company also has plans to test its missile systems in Ukraine, in co-operation with the country’s Ministry of Defence.

Frankenburg has a staff of about 50. Many of its employees are ex-military leaders and top engineers drawn from the private sector and academia. According to Salm, his team’s modest size makes the company nimble. “We’re faster, more flexible and not locked into outdated models,” he says. While Russian factories churn out low-cost drones by the hundreds of thousands, Europe’s air-defence systems are complex, prohibitively expensive and too slow to scale. “Europe is behind and, unless we invest trillions in defence capabilities, we’ll stay behind,” he adds.

Unlike conventional missile systems, Frankenburg’s products are intended to be scalable, partially disposable and manufactured using commercial components. Many of the sensors in its missiles, for example, are the same as those found in smartphones. The company also relies heavily on 3D-printing and rapid prototyping to slash costs and to iterate quickly. “There is no time to waste,” says Salm. “We can’t afford to move at the pace of traditional procurement cycles. The battlefield is changing now.”

Greenjets

UK

Drones might be reshaping battlefield planning but the wasp-like buzzing of an unmanned autonomous aerial vehicle hardly makes for a stealthy entrance. UK-based Greenjets, which was founded in 2021, saw an opportunity to address this and is developing electric-powered jet engines for vertical take-off and landing that emit just a third of the noise.

The company launched its first engine of this kind in 2023. Designed to power the next generation of small unmanned aircraft, the IPM5 was inspired by the helicopter-shaped seeds of sycamore trees, which the wind can carry great distances. Its ducted-fan architecture helps to keep the volume down while making it safer and more secure than conventional engines with open-bladed propellers.

Though it weighs just 750g in total, the IPM5 efficiently provides plenty of thrust. It is now shipping to drone manufacturers. The company plans to eventually roll out models for larger aircraft that are capable of carrying passengers; it has released renders of a futuristic-looking “air taxi” and a timeline to have them aloft by 2028. That might sound ambitious – but there’s nothing wrong with aiming for the sky.

Pangolin Defense

France

Ballistic-protection specialist Pangolin Defense’s signature vest can take a pummelling. It incorporates glass scales to create flexible ballistic plates that make for comfortable and affordable bulletproof armour. Founded in 2020 by four students, Pangolin Défense received an early grant from the French ministry of defence that allowed it to manufacture everything in the country.

The company now makes 3,000 vests a month, which it supplies to militaries and police forces across the globe, as well as the UN. It has also recently expanded into the US. “Our goal is to win a major national or European public tender before the end of the year,” says co-founder Clément Saglio. “That will get us a seat at the big kids’ table.” The war in Ukraine led to a spike in demand and Pangolin Défense has doubled its revenue over the past two years.

Himera

Ukraine

Kyiv-based walkie-talkie maker Himera launched in 2022 to solve a problem: Ukrainian soldiers had few effective, cheap and reliable ways to communicate. “You can have the most sophisticated weapons and equipment but if you can’t co-ordinate, most of that becomes useless,” says Himera’s co-founder Misha Rudominski.

The company offers radio and communication devices that are resistant to external interference, such as that from Russian troops, as well as cheap to produce. In 2024 it announced a deal with Ottawa’s Quantropi to distribute its products in the US, Canada and selected Nato markets. Being based in Ukraine is an advantage to the business. “It has given us the best understanding of how our products work in practice,” says Rudominski. “Our users write to us from the battlefield, reporting any problems. We take that information on board and fix things.”

Icebreakers are key to navigating the Arctic. Helsinki Shipyard is a historic builder that, until 2023, was owned by Russians and was heavily affected by sanctions. That year it was acquired by Québec-based firm Davie, which has been building ships in Canada since 1825. Its first new vessel, the Polar Max, will be delivered to the Canadian coast guard in 2030. “The door to the Arctic is wide open and the West isn’t winning the race,” says Davie’s Paul Barrett. “We’re looking to accelerate joint shipbuilding efforts on both sides of the Atlantic, with a view to securing the strategic interests of the West in the High North.”

Nordic Air Defence

Sweden

Swedish start-up Nordic Air Defence’s Kreuger 100 is a battery-powered, non-explosive drone interceptor that relies on built-in software to locate its target and knock it out of the sky. It’s named after Swedish tycoon Ivar Kreuger, who built a business empire on matches. “He took something potentially dangerous and made it safe, mass-manufacturable and cheap,” says the company’s business director Jens Holzapfel. “We will do the same with counter-drones. In Ukraine, it’s a numbers game right now. To compete, the countermeasures against drones must be cheaper than the actual threat – or, at least, not exceed its price.”

Helsing AI

Germany

Founded in 2021, Munich-based Helsing AI is among Europe’s leading defence start-ups and was valued at €5bn last year. It creates AI software for battlefield planning that’s capable of crunching vast amounts of data from sensors and weapons systems, enabling split-second decision-making. It has also been used to co-ordinate drone “swarms” in Ukraine. Both a technology and a hardware company, Helsing makes products, such as its HX-2 drones, at “resilience factories” designed with local supply chains in mind.

The firm received support from venture-capital fund Accel, an early backer of Facebook and Spotify, and has partnered with French-American space start-up Loft Orbital to deploy Europe’s first AI-powered multi-sensor satellite constellation. In collaboration with Swedish aerospace firm Saab, Helsing is set to upgrade the electronic-warfare capabilities of 15 of the German Luftwaffe’s Eurofighters.

Space Forge

UK

Space Forge is a young company that is reviving an old idea: manufacturing in space. Its focus is the crystals that go into compound semi­conductor chips, which are crucial to the energy-intensive radar and communication systems used by the defence industry, as well as by AI. “All of the things that make Earth a lovely place to live, such as gravity and the atmosphere, are terrible for almost any industrial process,” says Joshua Western, co-founder of Space Forge. Growing these crystals in space, he adds, is far quicker, with a lower risk of impurities.

In the summer, Western’s team will send its Forgestar-1 grower into orbit. Though still testing its product, the start-up has attracted industry interest and is collaborating with US defence giant Northrop Grumman. “Semiconductors are the oil of the 21st century,” says Western. “They underpin all critical infrastructure and whoever has the best material to make the best chip has the biggest edge.”

Nike to raise US prices as firms face tariffs uncertainty,"Nike to raise US prices as firms face tariffs uncertainty

2 hours ago Share Save Annabelle Liang & Dearbail Jordan Business reporters, BBC News Share Save

Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the US from early June, weeks after rival Adidas warned it would have to hike the cost of products due to tariffs. The sportswear giant did not name US tariffs explicitly as a reason for the increase, saying it regularly made ""price adjustments"". Almost all of Nike's goods are made in Asia - a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs. The US has paused higher so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs until July, but a ""base"" levy of 10% remains in place against a long list of countries.

Tariffs, which are a tax on imports, are almost always paid by the company that is importing the goods into a country rather than the business which makes the product. While importers can decide to absorb the extra charge, they often choose to pass it on to the consumer. Ahead of his tariff announcements, Trump disputed those predictions. He has since attacked firms, including Mattel and Walmart, that have linked price rises to the measures. ""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,"" he wrote on social media over the weekend, saying the company had made billions of dollars and should ""eat the tariffs"". Commenting on its price rises, Nike said: ""We regularly evaluate our business and make pricing adjustments as part of our seasonal planning."" In a call with investors in March, Nike's finance chief Matt Friend said that the company was ""navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment"" including tariffs. He also said Nike was monitoring ""the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence"". From Sunday, 1 June, most Nike shoes that cost more than $100 (£74.50) will see prices rise by as much as $10. Prices of clothing and equipment will also be raised by between $2 to $10. Nike's popular Air Force 1 trainers, as well as shoes that cost less than $100, will be exempted from the price hikes. Children's products and Jordan branded apparel and accessories will also be excluded. Last month, Adidas said that levies imposed by Trump would lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba. On Wednesday, UK sportswear retailer JD Sports said higher prices in its key US market due to tariffs could hit customer demand.

Companies around the world are contending with the uncertainty of the Trump administration's trade policies. A slew of steep ""reciprocal"" tariffs, which were announced on 2 April, were put on hold as countries from around the world negotiate with the White House. Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and China - countries that make shoes for US companies - are set to face some of the heaviest US import taxes of between 32% to 54%. The 90-day pause is due to expire in early July, but the base 10% tariff remains in place. Vietnam is by far the biggest manufacturer of Nike goods. In its last full financial year, the company said factories in Vietnam produced 50% of all its footwear and 26% of its clothing. Companies in China, Indonesia and Cambodia also make products for Nike. Manufacturing for overseas businesses is a key sector for Vietnam and Trump placed one of the highest reciprocal tariffs on the country at 46%. This week, the US president's son, Eric, is visiting Vietnam days after the country's government approved a plan by the Trump Organisation and local business Kinh Bac City Development to invest $1.5bn in hotels, golf courses and luxury real estate. The Trump Organisation is also scouting for locations to build a Trump Tower in Ho Chi Minh City. Nike said it would sell products directly to Amazon in the US for the first time since 2019. The company had previously listed its goods on the platform, but stopped six years ago to focus on its official website and physical stores as part of a strategy by its then chief executive John Donahoe. However, Nike's online sales have been falling. In its most recent results for the three months to the end of February, digital sales tumbled across all the regions where Nike sells its goods, with Europe, the Middle East and Africa showing the sharpest drop of 25% while Greater China recorded a 20% fall. The company's overall revenue has been declining and late last year Nike brought back Elliott Hill, a former senior executive, to takeover running the business from Mr Donahoe. Mr Hill is now conducting a turnaround of Nike which will focus on the UK, the US and China.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3315er3gygo,Business

Summary

Companies OPEC in pursuit of market share, says Onyx analyst

411,000 bpd increase likely, RBC Capital analyst says

U.S. crude inventories rise unexpectedly

HOUSTON, May 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday after a report that OPEC+ is discussing a production increase for July, stoking concerns that global supply could exceed demand growth.

Brent futures fell 57 cents, or 0.88%, to $64.34 a barrel by 11:17 a.m. EDT (1517 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 53 cents, or 0.86%, at $61.04.

Sign up here.

An increase of 411,000 barrels per day for July is among the options under discussion, though no final agreement has been reached, the report said, citing delegates.

Reuters previously reported that the group planned to accelerate output increases and could bring back as much as 2.2 million bpd by November. OPEC+ has been in the process of unwinding production cuts, with additions to the market in May and June.

""We're seeing the market reacting to evidence that OPEC is letting go of a strategy to defend price in favour of market share,"" said Harry Tchiliguirian at Onyx Capital Group. ""It's a bit like taking off a Band-Aid; you do it in one fell swoop.""

RBC Capital analyst Helima Croft said in a note on Wednesday that a 411,000-bpd increase from July is the ""most likely outcome"" from the meeting, primarily from Saudi Arabia.

""A key question will be whether the voluntary cut will be fully drawn down before the leaves turn brown in many parts of the world, in line with the original taper schedule,"" she said.

Prices were already lower in the session after Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday showed U.S. crude and fuel inventories showed surprise stock builds last week as crude imports hit a six-week high and gasoline and distillate demand slipped.

Crude inventories rose by 1.3 million barrels to 443.2 million barrels in the week ended May 16, the EIA said. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected a drawdown of 1.3 million barrels.

The EIA's surprise stock builds will exert downward pressure on prices, particularly on WTI, said Emril Jamil at LSEG Oil Research, adding that this could further encourage more U.S. exports to Europe and Asia.

Meanwhile, a U.S. oil license in Venezuela will expire on May 27, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a post on his personal X account late on Wednesday.

Sir Jony Ive, the hugely influential British designer responsible for the look of Apple's most iconic and successful products, is joining OpenAI. Boss Sam Altman said he was ""thrilled"" to be partnering with the man he called the ""greatest designer in the world"". OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is buying Sir Jony's startup, io, in a $6.5bn (£4.7bn) deal. Mr Altman said he was excited to ""try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers"" together. Sir Jony - who designed the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad - will ""assume deep design and creative responsibilities"" across the company, the two firms said in an announcement.

Re-imagining the computer

AI software has made rapid advances in recent years, spearheaded by ChatGPT. But developing new hardware based around it has proved more of a challenge - with several recent attempts failing to interest consumers and attracting derision from reviewers. Mr Altman though has spoken of his confidence that this partnership can succeed where others have failed. ""I think we have the opportunity here to kind of completely re-imagine what it means to use a computer,"" he said in a video that accompanied the announcement. Sir Jony said he believed the world was on the ""brink of a new generation of technology"". It may not be long until this new ""family of devices"" from the pair make an impact. ""The first one we've been working on I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" said Sir Jony. Mr Altman said he has already tried out a prototype of a new device designed by Sir Jony and his team, and he thinks it is ""the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen"".

'A singular figure in the design world'

Sir Jony worked for Apple for 27 years, helping to revive the company with groundbreaking products including the iPhone and iPod. He also designed the iMac in 1998 and the iPad in 2010. When Sir Jony left the company in 2019, Apple's CEO Tim Cook described him as ""a singular figure in the design world and his role in Apple's revival cannot be overstated"". Shares in Apple fell more than 2% following the news of his partnership with OpenAI.

He left to found his own company, LoveFrom, which has worked with companies such as Airbnb and Moncler. In the announcement about the merger, it said LoveFrom had been ""quietly collaborating"" with OpenAI for two years. The idea for io, which Sir Jony founded last year with others, followed this partnership. ""It became clear that our ambitions to develop, engineer and manufacture a new family of products demanded an entirely new company,"" said Sir Jony and Mr Altman. OpenAI had a 23% stake in the start-up prior to Wednesday's announcement, according to US media. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, told BBC News that it would be ""foolish to bet against Jony Ive, given his remarkable track record of delivering products that disrupt a market"". ""There is no question that OpenAI would love to have a direct relationship with its customers rather than delivering services via devices made by or powered by Apple, Google, or others,"" he added.

Ministers said to be considering bill to wipe out British Steel’s debts,"Ministers are reportedly considering legislation to relieve British Steel of debts that have risen to nearly £1bn, as the government considers how best to prepare the Scunthorpe steelworks for sale.

The government took control of the business last month after it said its Chinese owner, Jingye Steel, planned to close the plant within days. The move required emergency legislation that was passed in a historic recall of parliament.

Jingye remains the legal owner of British Steel, despite the takeover, and is owed money by the company. Those debts would probably have been wiped out in a liquidation. However, the Labour government prevented that from happening, fearing as many as 2,700 job cuts and the symbolic loss of the ability to produce steel from iron ore in Britain.

British Steel owed £711m to Jingye businesses at the end of December 2023, according to its last filed accounts. Net debt has risen to just under £1bn in the year and a half since then, government and industry sources told the Financial Times. The government is considering ways to wipe out that debt, including new legislation, the FT reported.

Legislation to wipe out debts would be highly controversial, as it would in effect destroy a privately held asset. It could make foreign investors more wary of investing in the UK.

A debt-free British Steel would be a much more attractive prospect for a possible buyer for Scunthorpe, where two blast furnaces are operating. It is thought that the government would provide hundreds of millions of pounds for investment in a new electric arc furnace to produce much cleaner steel. That would secure Scunthorpe’s longer-term future.

The industry minister, Sarah Jones, said on Tuesday the government had so far provided £94m to British Steel in working capital needed to buy raw materials and pay salaries.

Jingye bought British Steel in early 2020, after Boris Johnson’s Conservative government bore the cost of running the company for several months during the search for a buyer. The previous owner, Greybull Capital, an investment firm, had walked away.

The Jingye takeover, completed in March 2020, came just as the Covid pandemic began to disrupt global supply chains. The Scunthorpe plant was losing about £700,000 a day when Jingye announced plans to close it.

The government had offered Jingye £500m in state aid to make the switch to electric arc furnaces, but the company, whose other steel facilities are all in China, asked for significantly more.

The switch would also be financially risky for any buyer. Liberty Steel, the operator of the UK’s biggest existing electric arc furnace in Rotherham, is in talks with creditors as it faces a winding-up petition. Liberty, which is owned by the metal magnate Sanjeev Gupta, has not produced any steel for nine months.

Liberty and the rest of the UK steel industry have long argued that British wholesale energy costs are too high to be competitive with rivals in France and Germany, let alone in China.

"Trump’s tax bill to cost 830,000 jobs and drive up bills and pollution emissions, experts warn","A Republican push to dismantle clean energy incentives threatens to reverberate across the US by costing more than 830,000 jobs, raising energy bills for US households and threatening to unleash millions more tonnes of the planet-heating pollution that is causing the climate crisis, experts have warned.

A major tax bill passed by the Republican-held House of Representatives on Thursday morning will, as currently written, demolish key components of climate legislation signed by Joe Biden that has spurred a record torrent of renewable energy and electric vehicle investment in the US.

Under the reconciliation bill, tax credits for cleaner cars will end this year, with incentives for wind, solar and even nuclear energy projects scaled down and then eliminated by 2032. Clean energy manufacturing tax credits will be axed by 2031, while Americans seeking to upgrade their homes to cleaner or more energy efficient appliances will get no further subsidy after the end of this year.

“This bill is worse than what people envisioned – it pulls the rug out from facilities banking on these incentives, it raises everyday household costs by hundreds of dollars and undercuts any sort of action on climate change,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan climate policy thinktank.

“You can’t overstate how significant this will be in weakening the US’s position. With inflation, tariffs and rising electricity use, it really couldn’t come at a worse time. It’s a really damaging bill.”

Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, more than $320bn has flowed mostly to Republican-held districts in the form of new clean energy development and electric car construction. A further $522bn in investment is in the pipeline but is now menaced by the Republican bill’s removal of tax incentives.

“You’re talking about half a trillion dollars of investment at risk from these changes,” said Orvis. “Over 10 years, we found that these changes would reduce US GDP by over $1tn.”

The legislation also follows months of attacks on green spending from the Trump administration, including the end of energy efficiency programs and climate-focused grantmaking and loans.

“If you take all of that together, all of these pieces have the same effect: it’s going to increase prices on everybody,” one former senior Department of Energy official said.

Republicans wrangled over how far to slash the IRA’s tax credits.The bill as it stands will cause Americans’ energy bills to spike by stymying new renewable energy – often the cheapest form of new electricity generation – the non-partisan thinktank Energy Innovation calculated. The average household will see their bills rise by more than $230 by 2035. This comes on top of the cost of tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, who has attempted to aggressively push the US to “drill, baby, drill” for more oil and gas at the expense of solar and wind, which he has called “ugly” and “disgusting” and barred from federal lands and waters.

“This will all come at the expense of the environment,” said Orvis.

The new bill will also cause the US to emit 260m tonnes more pollution than it would’ve otherwise in 2035, which is more than the entire annual emissions of Spain. While emissions would still decline overall, the US is cutting pollution far too slowly to avert the worst impacts from the heatwaves, floods, drought and other disasters fueled by global heating.

And the legislation will cost the US 830,000 jobs by 2030 compared with the status quo, Energy Innovation found. That includes the direct loss of jobs in fields such as solar panel manufacturing and electric vehicle production, indirect job loss from the decreased investments and lower clean energy demand, and induced cuts resulting from consumer spending cuts attributable to layoffs, higher fuel costs, and other third-order effects.

“The Inflation Reduction Act was carefully crafted to create good-paying jobs in deindustrialized communities, underserved communities, and coal communities. We have seen that it is doing just that, creating good jobs you don’t need a college degree to get and opening up pathways to the middle class across the nation,” said Ted Fertik, vice-president of manufacturing and industrial policy at climate and labor advocacy group Blue Green Alliance. “Killing the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act is a direct attack on working Americans.”

Other experts have also warned about the devastating consequences of the legislation. By 2028, the reconciliation bill would kill approximately 300,000 jobs in the solar and energy storage sectors, found an analysis from the industry group Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released on Monday.

Organized labor is increasingly speaking out against the megabill. This week, the president of the North America’s Building Trades Unions said: “Job cuts for blue-collar Americans should not foot the bill for billionaire tax cuts.” And last week, the president of an electrical worker union in Washington state wrote an op-ed defending the IRA.

Warring blocs in the GOP fought for months over the fate of the IRA’s green incentives. While some moderate, IRA-defending Republicans floated reconciliation language aimed at preserving its green credits, a handful of hardliners demanded an even quicker phaseout of clean energy programs.

The latter faction has critiqued the IRA on the grounds that it is anti-populist, with Oklahoma congressperson Josh Brecheen deeming it “nothing more than a massive, taxpayer-funded gift to green energy lobbyists and their leftist billionaire employers” and Texas congressperson Chip Roy critiquing calling it the “green new scam”.

But the rich are expected to benefit most from the reconciliation bill’s tax cuts, while the rollback of IRA credits is expected to raise household costs and slash employment – particularly in red districts, which have enjoyed the vast majority of investment spurred by the IRA.

The Republican legislation, which will act as an effective repeal of the climate bill, is compounded by the actions of the Trump administration, which has set about eviscerating rules limiting pollution from cars, trucks and power plants and sought to halt other efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

The combined impact of all these actions is set to exact a greater toll than the bill itself, resulting in as much as 730m tonnes of extra pollution over the next decade, a separate study by Rhodium, another energy research group, has found.

“This is just about as bad as it gets,” said Ben King, associate director at Rhodium. “If you’re a solar or wind developer, there’s no reason you’d choose the US rather than China after this. The proposals are cutting off the nose to spite the face, it’s unclear what the policy objectives are other than they don’t like the policies.

May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. federal antitrust enforcers were expected to express support on Thursday for arguments wielded by Republican states that accuse asset managers BlackRock (BLK.N) , opens new tab , Vanguard and State Street (STT.N) , opens new tab of conspiring through climate activism to decrease coal output, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission were expected to file a statement of interest in the case where Texas and 12 other states claim the companies used their substantial holdings in U.S. coal companies to discourage competition.

Sign up here.

The development marks a political setback for the top asset managers. With some $27 trillion among them, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have come under fire from conservative Republicans, many from energy-producing states, who say the firms wrongly put environmental and social concerns above maximizing returns for their customers.

Spokespeople for the asset managers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

BlackRock, for instance, faces restrictions and outright bans on managing public assets in states including Texas and Indiana over its ESG policies. There were signs of thawing relations in February when the company led a consortium to buy ports near the strategic Panama Canal waterway, a deal hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump

The asset managers have called the case ""half-baked"" and say there is no evidence they pressed for reduced output. U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Tyler, Texas, is scheduled to hear arguments on the asset managers' bid to dismiss the case in June.

CEO Andy Jassy says he’s ‘very bullish’ on Amazon’s grocery business,"We know if we want to serve as many customers as we want, we need to have a broader, mass perishables offering. And we have several efforts here. We've been working on the second version of our physical Amazon Fresh stores, and those are showing meaningful progress in terms of what the performance looks like versus the first version of those Fresh stores. We've also been experimenting with a number of other concepts that we think have promise. These are things like at Whole Foods Market stores, where we have a store within a store, where we're able to have items that maybe Whole Foods Market doesn't supply, but that a lot of families want to shop when they do their weekly grocery shopping. Similar type of idea, being able to get some of those items in micro-fulfillment capabilities, on locations at certain Whole Foods Market stores. And then an offering that I would say we have seen some very early success on, that's very promising, which is we have these same day facilities that we fulfill millions of SKUs out of for our retail business, typically same day.",https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-grocery-business,Business

More than half of pension funds exceed private equity allocation targets,"Pension funds were the institutional investors most likely to be over their target allocation to private equity as global economic shifts clouded the outlook for private equity fundraising.

More than half of government-, corporate- and union-sponsored pension plans showed an overallocation to private equity in their latest publicly available financial reports, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. Corporate pension plans had the highest number of overallocated sponsors compared to underallocated.

Several other categories of private equity limited partners (LPs) — including sovereign wealth funds, foundations and real estate investment managers — were also over their allocation targets, but publicly available allocation data was limited, making it difficult to draw conclusions.

Overallocation could limit pension fund commitments to new private equity funds, undercutting attempts to reverse the three-year slide in global fundraising.

Portfolio constraints

The slow pace of exits, which fell to a two-year low in the first quarter, is another factor restraining private equity fundraising. The sale or IPO of a portfolio company triggers a distribution of cash to LPs, but broad swaths of LPs, including university endowments, have seen lower-than-expected distributions from their private equity investments since 2022, Preqin noted in its 2025 institutional allocation study released earlier this year.

Pensions are now factoring lower distributions into their private equity pacing models, which keeps allocations on target by anticipating future flows of capital into and out of the private equity segment of their portfolios.

""That's leading [pensions] to deploy less. Your budget has to go down because you're not expecting to get money back,"" said John Haggerty, a managing principal and director of private market investments for Meketa Investment Group Inc., an adviser to pension funds and other private equity LPs.

Denominator effect

A public market correction earlier this year increased pressure on pension fund portfolios.

Broad declines in public equity valuations increased the risk of a denominator effect, which occurs when public market assets lose value faster than private market assets, Preqin noted in its first-quarter update on the private equity market. For pensions and other LPs already at or above their target private equity allocation, the denominator effect would push them further into overallocation territory by increasing the relative value of the private equity holdings in their portfolio.

The S&P 500, which on April 8 was down more than 15% for the year, subsequently recovered, re-entering positive territory on May 13. However, a prolonged tariff spat between the US and China could send markets down again and reinvigorate the denominator effect, said Paul Spendiff, head of business development in Europe for Gen II Fund Services, LLC, a PE fund administrator.

""The problem is these waves of uncertainty delaying decision-making, delaying investment,"" Spendiff said.

Outlook

Blackstone Inc. President and COO Jonathan Gray acknowledged the same dynamic in April on the firm's first-quarter earnings call.

""You may see a little bit of a slowdown in decision-making, there may be a little bit of a denominator effect, but the overall bias is towards more alternatives,"" Gray said, referring to fundraising prospects among its large, North American LPs, including pension funds.

Pensions are among the most seasoned private equity investors and have been through previous down cycles for PE, added Bart Molloy, a partner at Monument Group Inc., a placement agent connecting LPs and private equity funds.

""Go back to the aftermath of [the Global Financial Crisis in] 2008, where there were a couple of good vintage years where some people stayed on the sidelines, they recognized in retrospect, a little too long,"" Molloy said.

""What we're seeing with pensions and, of course, with their consultants and their gatekeepers, is still a real commitment to trying to be as consistent as they can in vintage year diversification.""",https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/5/more-than-half-of-pension-funds-exceed-private-equity-allocation-targets-89164143,Business

AI could account for nearly half of datacentre power usage ‘by end of year’,"Artificial intelligence systems could account for nearly half of datacentre power consumption by the end of this year, analysis has revealed.

The estimates by Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of the Digiconomist tech sustainability website, came as the International Energy Agency forecast that AI would require almost as much energy by the end of this decade as Japan uses today.

De Vries-Gao’s calculations, to be published in the sustainable energy journal Joule, are based on the power consumed by chips made by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices that are used to train and operate AI models. The paper also takes into account the energy consumption of chips used by other companies, such as Broadcom.

The IEA estimates that all data centres – excluding mining for cryptocurrencies – consumed 415 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity last year. De Vries-Gao argues in his research that AI could already account for 20% of that total.

He said a number of variables came into his calculations, such as the energy efficiency of a datacentre and electricity consumption related to cooling systems for servers handling an AI system’s busy workloads. Datacentres are the central nervous system of AI technology, with their high energy demands making sustainability a key concern in the development and use of artificial intelligence systems.

By the end of 2025, De Vries-Gao estimates, energy consumption by AI systems could approach up to 49% of total datacentre power consumption, again excluding crypto mining. AI consumption could reach 23 gigawatts (GW), the research estimates, twice the total energy consumption of the Netherlands.

However, De Vries-Gao said a number of factors could lead to a slowdown in hardware demand, such as waning demand for applications such as ChatGPT. Another issue could be geopolitical tensions resulting in constraints on producing AI hardware, such as export controls. De Vries-Gao cites the example of barriers on Chinese access to chips, which contributed to the release of the DeepSeek R1 AI model that reportedly used fewer chips.

“These innovations can reduce the computational and energy costs of AI,” said de Vries.

But he said any efficiency gains could encourage even more AI use. Multiple countries attempting to build their own AI systems – a trend known as “sovereign AI” – could also increase hardware demand. De Vries-Gao also pointed to a US datacentre startup, Crusoe Energy, securing 4.5GW of gas-powered energy capacity for its infrastructure, with the ChatGPT developer OpenAI among the potential customers through its Stargate joint venture.

“There are early indications that these [Stargate] datacentres could exacerbate dependence on fossil fuels,” writes De Vries-Gao.

On Thursday OpenAI announced the launch of a Stargate project in the United Arab Emirates, the first outside the US.

Microsoft and Google admitted last year that their AI drives were endangering their ability to meet internal environmental targets.

De Vries-Gao said information on AI’s power demands had become increasingly scarce, with the analyst describing it as an “opaque industry”. The EU AI Act requires AI companies to disclose the energy consumption behind training a model but not for day-to-day use.

Prof Adam Sobey, the mission director for sustainability at the UK’s Alan Turing Institute, an AI research body, said more transparency was needed on how much energy is consumed by artificial intelligence systems, and how much they could save by helping to make carbon-emitting industries such as transport and energy more efficient.

Sobey said: “I suspect that we don’t need many very good use cases [of AI] to offset the energy being used on the front end.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/22/ai-data-centre-power-consumption,Business

Tax rise warning after higher-than-expected UK government borrowing,"Tax rise warning after higher-than-expected UK borrowing

Higher-than-expected government borrowing figures have increased the prospect of Chancellor Rachel Reeves raising taxes in the autumn, experts say. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £20.2bn in April, up £1bn from the same month last year, official figures showed. It is the fourth highest April figure since monthly records began in 1993 and analysts said it could mean Reeves will struggle to meet her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing. Ruth Gregory, Capital Economics deputy chief UK economist, said the ""poor start"" to the financial year meant tax rises were ""starting to feel inevitable"".

She said weaker economic growth forecast over the next few months was likely to hit tax receipts, adding to pressure on government finances. ""With the PM announcing a partial U-turn on the cut to winter fuel payments, the dilemma faced by the chancellor over how to deal with increased spending pressures in environment of low economic growth and high interest rates hasn't gone away,"" Ms Gregory said. Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""Talk of the reinstatement of some winter fuel payments and the likely need to spend more on defence will further increase the pressure for tax rises."" On Wednesday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, in a U-turn following mounting political pressure in recent weeks. In her October 2024 Budget, Reeves had introduced £40bn in tax increases, the largest since 1993. However, at the time she pledged there would be no additional tax rises beyond those already announced. The chancellor is following two main rules, which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy: day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing

to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30 Reacting to the latest borrowing figures, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: ""After years of economic instability crippling the public purse, we have taken the decisions to stabilise our public finances, which has helped deliver four interest rate cuts since August, cutting the cost of borrowing for businesses and working people."" How much money does the UK government borrow, and does it matter?

Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: ""Instead of reining in spending, the Labour chancellor has piled billions onto the national debt by fiddling the fiscal rules and maxing out the national credit card."" Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper accused the chancellor of making ""a series of blunders"". ""The warning lights must be flashing in the Treasury this morning,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e55l8zx4go,Business

WASHINGTON, May 22 (Reuters) - Inflation-adjusted earnings stalled across age and income groups over the past year, while the sometimes rapid wage gains of the COVID-19 era have left workers as a whole little better off five years later, a JPMorganChase Institute study concluded.

The study, released on Thursday, said after-tax take-home pay, adjusted for inflation that soared above 9% in 2022, grew more slowly than the economy as a whole from 2019 through 2025, likely leaving workers with a smaller share of annual output.

Sign up here.

While lower-paid workers have kept the relative wage gains made early in the pandemic, when their pay was rising faster than others, that progress has stalled recently, the study found, with earnings growing about the same across income categories.

""While the labor market has been strong, American workers may sense that it could have been even stronger,"" as the economy continued to grow but wage gains were offset by inflation, the institute said in its study.

It used data from about 20 million checking accounts, including 7 million from the 2019-2025 period, to track take-home earnings of individuals by income level and age.

The findings are potentially relevant for Federal Reserve officials trying to gauge the resilience of consumer spending should inflation accelerate due to the Trump administration's import tariffs

Retail spending barely grew in April after a surge of buying in March that may have reflected efforts to make purchases before the tariffs on goods from China and other major trading partners took effect.

Whether spending rebounds or continues to slow from here will be important to U.S. central bankers trying to understand the impact of trade policy on the economy. Firms like Walmart have warned of future price increases, while Fed officials and economists say households are facing mounting financial challenges, including the restart of student loan repayments and the loss of financial buffers built up from government payments during the pandemic.

""Workers can see how their wages are moving, and they can read the paper and understand what is happening"" on trade and other issues, Institute President Christopher Wheat said in an interview. ""Eventually you'd think that is going to show up in spending, though we've not directly seen that yet.""

SSCI Spotlights Trends in Social Sustainability at FSSC Insights,"In her panel discussion, Reguse identified three key trends driving this shift:

Demand for greater credibility in sustainability programmes. Movement towards purposeful auditing — using credible social audits to enhance and inform due diligence strategies. Alignment with human rights due diligence (HRDD) and emerging regulations, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

Reguse said “In today’s complex regulatory landscape, businesses need clarity and trust in the tools they use. That’s where SSCI comes in — by recognising credible standards and aligning expectations, we help companies turn ambition into action and build stronger, more responsible supply chains.”

With hundreds of schemes and programmes on the market, it can be difficult for organisations to know which programme to use. SSCI addresses this by benchmarking and recognising credible schemes based on international norms and defining minimum criteria for credible social and environmental programmes.

Kim Jong Un’s fury after watching North Korea’s new navy destroyer crippled in botched launch,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —

North Korea’s newest warship was severely damaged during a launch ceremony Wednesday, with leader Kim Jong Un, who witnessed the accident, saying it brought shame to the nation’s prestige and vowing to punish those found responsible, state media reported.

In a rare admission of failure, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said a malfunction in the launch mechanism caused the stern of the as-yet unnamed 5,000-ton destroyer to slide prematurely into the water, crushing parts of the hull and leaving the bow stranded on the shipway.

Kim called the launch failure “a criminal act” and blamed it on “absolute carelessness” and “irresponsibility” by multiple state institutions - including the Munitions Industry Department, Kim Chaek University of Technology and the central ship design bureau.

According to a South Korean military analysis, the vessel is lying on its side in the water, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) spokesperson Lee Sung-joon said during a press briefing on Thursday.

Naval analysts said the damage incurred by a vessel in such a launch malfunction could be “catastrophic.” State media did not immediately release images of the accident.

“If the ship does not move together, the stresses will tear the hull apart,” Sal Mercogliano, a professor at Campbell University in North Carolina and a maritime expert, told CNN.

Naval analyst Carl Schuster in Hawaii, after reviewing the KCNA account, said he thinks the stresses would “warp the hull, induce cracks and (possibly) snap the keel depending on where the greatest stress falls.”

The launch failure marks a setback for what analysts have viewed as North Korea’s most ambitious naval modernization effort in decades.

The ship was to be the second major navy surface vessel revealed in quick succession by North Korea. In April, Kim unveiled the Choe Hyon, the country’s first newly constructed destroyer in decades, and declared his ambition of building more destroyers and various cruisers and frigates.

The Choe Hyon, described as a “new generation” warship, was presented with significant fanfare with state media saying it would strengthen naval readiness amid what Pyongyang calls rising threats from the United States and South Korea.

Western defense analysts noted that the Choe Hyon marked a departure from the aging Soviet-era vessels that dominated the Korean People’s Navy. While details remain scarce, satellite imagery and footage suggested the Choe Hyon could share design elements with similar Russian navy ships.

Lee, the South Korean military spokesperson, said the vessel damaged on Wednesday was thought to be equipped like the Choe Hyon.

Wednesday’s incident could cast doubt on the country’s ability to scale its navy. Kim said the damage would be addressed not only through technical repairs, but political accountability.

He ordered the destroyer to be restored before the late June plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party, calling the matter one of national honor.

However, considering the potential degree of damage, analysts said that it would be nearly impossible to meet Kim’s deadline.

Retired South Korean Adm. Kim Duk-ki told CNN that North Korea appeared to lack the necessary infrastructure – a dry dock – to launch a 5,000-ton destroyer, let alone recover and repair it.

A dry dock is a basin facility that can be filled with water to float a ship or drain out to build or repair one.

“Dry dock is an expensive facility, and North Korea probably doesn’t have one… It’s easy to repair a ship in a dry dock after draining water, but they don’t have the facility,” the retired admiral said, adding that restoration could take over four to five months.

South Korean lawmaker and defense analyst Yu Yong-weon said rushing the launch of the ship likely led to the problems encountered on Wednesday and warned hasty repairs could cause more problems down the line.

Schuster said repairs, if possible, are more likely to take months, rather than weeks.

An accident investigation group has been formed, and senior officials may face censure at the upcoming Party Central Committee meeting, an account from KCNA reported.

North Korea’s navy is often seen as the least developed branch of its military. The hastened pace of destroyer development has surprised some outside observers, raising questions about how much of the technology is functional versus symbolic.

Mercogliano, the US professor, said it’s unclear whether Pyongyang’s new warships even have engines as state media has provided no images of them underway.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/asia/north-korea-destroyer-accident-intl-hnk-ml,World

UN says 90 lorry loads of aid now in Gaza after delay at crossing,"UN says 90 lorry loads of aid now in Gaza after three-day delay at crossing

EPA More aid lorries entered Gaza through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing on Thursday

More than 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected by UN teams inside the Gaza Strip, three days after Israel eased an 11-week-long blockade. The aid, which included flour, baby food and medical equipment, was picked up from the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday night and taken to warehouses for distribution. Pictures showed a bakery producing bread with some of the flour. The UN said the delays were due to insecurity along the single access route which the Israeli military had approved. Israeli authorities said they allowed an additional 100 lorry loads through Kerem Shalom on Wednesday. However, the UN said it was ""nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza"".

Humanitarian organisations have warned of acute levels of hunger among the 2.1 million population, amid significant shortages of basic foods and skyrocketing prices. Palestinian Authority Health Minister Majed Abu Ramadan, who is based in the occupied West Bank, told reporters in Geneva on Thursday that 29 children and elderly people had died from ""starvation-related"" causes in the last couple of days, according to Reuters news agency. An assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has also said that half a million people face starvation in the coming months.

On Wednesday night, a UN spokesperson said its teams had ""collected around 90 truckloads of goods from the Kerem Shalom crossing and dispatched them into Gaza"". A video shared with the BBC showed the lorries with aid collected from Kerem Shalom driving in a convoy along a road in southern Gaza. Other footage showed bags of flour being unloaded at a bakery and hundreds of pita breads rolling out of its ovens on conveyor belts. Amjad al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organisations Network in Gaza, said bakeries backed by the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) would produce bread that would be handed out by the agency's staff. ""The idea is to try and reach the most needy families, those who are desperate, as it is just the start,"" he told Reuters. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had brought in one lorry load of medical supplies for a field hospital in the southern city of Rafah, but that more was needed. ""A trickle of trucks is woefully inadequate. Only the rapid, unimpeded, and sustained flow of aid can begin to address the full scope of needs on the ground,"" it said.

Reuters Palestinian workers were pictured unloading sacks of flour at a bakery in the southern city of Khan Younis overnight

Before the operation, senior WFP official Antoine Renard told the BBC that the problems with collecting the aid arose because the Israeli military wanted lorries to move along a route in Gaza which aid agencies considered to be dangerous. The route, he said, could leave them at risk of attack by desperately hungry civilians and armed criminal gangs. ""At market prices in Gaza right now, each truck full of flour is worth around $400,000 (£298,000),"" Mr Renard explained. He added that the solution would be ""hundreds of trucks daily"" travelling along a safe route to warehouses, noting ""the less we provide, the greater the risk and more anxiety created"" among the population. Mr Renard said aid agencies on the Gaza side did not employ armed guards to accompany their cargoes because it was considered too dangerous, so a lengthy ceasefire and an extension of the current five-day window for the transfer of food was urgently needed.

Israel stopped all deliveries of aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel also insisted there was no shortage of aid and accused Hamas of stealing supplies to give to its fighters or sell to raise money - an allegation the group denied. The UN also denied that aid had been diverted and said Israel was obliged under international humanitarian law to ensure food and medicine reached Gaza's population. On Wednesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was allowing a limited amount of food into Gaza so that the Israeli military could continue its newly expanded ground offensive and take full control of the Palestinian territory. ""At the end of this manoeuvre, all of the Gaza Strip will be under Israeli security control and Hamas will be completely defeated,"" he told a news conference. ""In order for us to keep our operational freedom of action, and to allow our best friends to continue to support us, we need to prevent a humanitarian crisis."" Netanyahu also said the controversial US-Israeli plan for aid in Gaza - which would bypass existing UN facilities and use a private company to distribute food from hubs in southern and central Gaza protected by security contractors and Israeli troops - would give Israel ""another tool to win the war"".

Two Israeli embassy staff shot dead outside Jewish museum in Washington,"Two Israeli embassy staffers were shot dead late on Wednesday outside a Jewish museum in Washington by a gunman who shouted “free Palestine”. authorities said, with US and Israeli leaders expressing shock and outrage over the killings.

US President Donald Trump quickly condemned the attack, saying, “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on anti-Semitism, must end, now!”

“Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA,” he added on social media.

Gunfire broke out on the sidewalk outside the Capital Jewish Museum in the centre of Washington as the venue held a social event for young professionals and diplomatic staff.

The victims were a young couple who planned to get married, the Israeli ambassador said.

A video clip circulating on social media showed a young bearded man in a jacket and white shirt shouting “free, free Palestine” as he was led away by police.

Police confirmed the suspected shooter walked into the museum after the shooting and had been detained.

“We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody,” Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith told reporters.

“Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum. He approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire.

“After the shooting, the suspect then entered the museum and was detained by event security.”

She said the handcuffed suspect identified where he had discarded the weapon and chanted “Free, free Palestine”. Police identified him as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered enhanced security measures at Israeli diplomatic missions worldwide after the incident.

“I have instructed to enhance security arrangements at Israeli missions around the world and to increase protection for state representatives,” he said.

“We are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel.”

“I am devastated by the scenes in Washington,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement.

“This is a despicable act of hatred, of anti-Semitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy.

“America and Israel will stand united in defence of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.”

‘Unspeakable act of violence’

Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said, “Harming diplomats and the Jewish community is crossing a red line.

“Israel will continue to act resolutely to protect its citizens and representatives — everywhere in the world.”

The targeted event appeared to be a reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC) for Jewish young professionals and the Washington diplomatic community.

The evening was “dedicated to fostering unity and celebrating Jewish heritage,” with an invitation to the event saying the location would be “shared upon registration”.

“American Jewish Committee (AJC) can confirm that we hosted an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC this evening,” AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement.

“We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue… Our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”

The museum is in downtown Washington, close to the US Capitol and just 1.6 kilometres from the White House.

Police Chief Smith said officers responded to multiple calls of a shooting near the museum at around 9pm on Wednesday evening (6am Thursday).

First responders found a man and a woman unconscious and not breathing. Despite life-saving efforts, both were pronounced dead.

Engagement

Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter told reporters the young staffers were a couple “about to be engaged”.

“The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,” Leiter said.

He added that he spoke to Trump by telephone, with the president assuring that the United States will “do everything it can possibly do to fight and end anti-Semitism.”

“We’ll stand together tall and firm, and we will confront this moral depravity without fear and with determination,” Leiter said.

Emergency vehicles remained at the scene in the morning after police taped off the area.

“We’re going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send the clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters.

“The horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city, and in our country. I want to be clear that we will not tolerate this violence or hate.”",https://www.dawn.com/news/1912576/two-israeli-embassy-staff-shot-dead-outside-jewish-museum-in-washington,World
Governments condemn Israel for firing towards diplomats in West Bank,"Canada, UK, France and Mexico among countries to condemn Israeli forces for firing ‘warning shots’ near diplomats.

More than a dozen governments have condemned Israel after its forces fired in the direction of a diplomatic delegation near the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.

The Israeli army said its soldiers fired “warning shots” after the foreign diplomats, who included representatives of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Russia and China, deviated from a previously agreed-on route.

“[Israeli] soldiers operating in the area fired warning shots to distance them away,” Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

No one was injured in the incident.

Here are some of the reactions from political leaders to the incident:

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney

The Israeli ambassador has been summoned to Global Affairs to see the minister and explain. We expect a full investigation and we expect an immediate explanation of what happened. It’s totally unacceptable, it’s some of many things that are totally unacceptable that’s going on in the region.

China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning

We demand the launch of a full investigation so that similar incidents do not happen again.

UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Hamish Falconer

Today’s events in Jenin are unacceptable. I have spoken to our diplomats who were affected. Civilians must always be protected, and diplomats allowed to do their jobs. There must be a full investigation, and those responsible should be held accountable.

Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin

I am deeply shocked and horrified that the [Israeli forces] today opened fire on a group of diplomats visiting the town of Jenin. Thankfully, nobody was killed or injured.

I unreservedly condemn this aggressive, intimidatory and violent act. This is not and must never be a normal way to behave.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani

We ask the government of Israel to immediately clarify what happened. The threats against diplomats are unacceptable.

Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp

Diplomats should be able to do their work, and threatening them is unacceptable. I have called the Dutch representative in the Palestinian territories and our ambassador to Israel and am relieved that the delegation is unharmed. We condemn the shooting, have requested clarification from the Israeli authorities and are considering further steps.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot

A visit to Jenin, in which one of our diplomats was participating, was fired upon by Israeli soldiers. This is unacceptable. The Israeli ambassador will be summoned to explain. Full support to our agents on site and their remarkable work in trying conditions.

Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen

This is a very serious and condemnable incident. I have spoken with the Finnish diplomat who was present at the situation. We demand an explanation from Israel about the situation.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen

It is unacceptable that Israel has fired shots near foreign diplomats. It has no place anywhere and is completely unacceptable.

The Danish head of mission in Ramallah was among the diplomats and is fortunately safe. In light of the seriousness of the situation, I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to summon the Israeli ambassador so that we can get an official explanation.

Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot

I was shocked to learn that the Israeli army opened fire on 20 diplomats today, including a Belgian colleague. Fortunately, he is fine. These diplomats were on an official visit to Jenin, coordinated with the Israeli army, in a convoy of 20 clearly recognisable vehicles. Belgium is asking Israel for a convincing explanation.

Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide

I condemn the attacks by [the Israeli military] against a group of diplomats in Jenin today. Diplomatic and consular staff enjoy a special status under international law and must be protected. These actions constitute a clear violation of international law and are deeply unacceptable.

Portugal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Portugal condemns the attack by the Israeli army on the diplomatic delegation in the Jenin refugee camp, West Bank. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs … expressed its solidarity with the Portuguese ambassador who was part of the delegation and will take the appropriate diplomatic measures.

Germany’s Federal Foreign Office

The Federal Foreign Office strongly condemns this unprovoked fire. We can count ourselves lucky that nothing more serious occurred.

The group was travelling in the West Bank in the course of its diplomatic work and in coordination with the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli army. The role of diplomats as independent observers on the ground is indispensable and in no way represents a threat to Israeli security interests.

The Israeli government must immediately investigate the circumstances and respect the inviolability of diplomats.

Slovenia’s Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs

Slovenia joins EU partners in condemning the gunfire that threatened foreign diplomats at Jenin camp.

Such intimidation violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and is utterly unacceptable. We expect a prompt, transparent Israeli investigation, full accountability and guarantees of safe, unhindered access for all diplomatic missions.

Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates

This is a clear violation of international law and international humanitarian law, and a crime that contravenes all diplomatic norms.

The Ministry’s official spokesperson, Ambassador Dr Sufyan Qudah, affirmed the kingdom’s absolute rejection and strong condemnation of this targeting, which constitutes a violation of diplomatic agreements and norms, particularly the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which defines the procedures and controls governing diplomatic work and grants immunities to diplomatic missions.

Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs

The state of Qatar strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces for opening fire on an international diplomatic delegation during its visit to the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, and considered as a violation of international laws, conventions, and diplomatic norms.

Turkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs

We condemn in the strongest terms the opening of fire by Israeli soldiers on a group of diplomats, including an official from the Turkish Consulate General in Jerusalem, during their visit to the city of Jenin.

This attack, which endangered the lives of diplomats, is yet another demonstration of Israel’s systematic disregard for international law and human rights. The targeting of diplomats constitutes a grave threat not only to individual safety but also to the mutual respect and trust that form the foundation of inter-state relations.

Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs

The Arab Republic of Egypt emphasises its absolute rejection of this incident, which violates all diplomatic norms, and calls upon the Israeli side to provide the necessary clarifications regarding the circumstances of this incident.

Uruguay’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the Israeli ambassador in Montevideo to clarify the incident.

Uruguay urges the Israeli government to investigate this incident and take the necessary measures to ensure the protection and allow the operations of diplomatic personnel accredited to the State of Palestine.

Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs

The Israeli military justified the action by stating that the diplomatic delegation had invaded an ‘unauthorised area’. However, there is no record of this occurring or of any officer approaching the delegation to verbally warn them in a timely manner.

What happened violates the provisions of Article 29 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which establishes the inviolability of diplomatic agents. All States Parties to the aforementioned Convention, including Israel, are obliged to respect it.

"Muslim World League backs UK, France, Canada statement on Gaza, West Bank","How President Trump’s Middle East tour signaled a bold reset in US foreign policy

LONDON: Standing ovations and scenes of jubilation are not normally witnessed at investment forums. But there was nothing normal about the speech President Donald Trump delivered at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh last week.

Speaking at the beginning of a four-day tour of the region, Trump’s geopolitical surprises came thick and fast.

“After discussing the situation in Syria with the (Saudi) crown prince,” he said, “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness.”

The last few words were almost drowned out by the wave of applause, which was followed by a standing ovation led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Although the announcement came as a big surprise to most, including seasoned analysts and even some in Trump’s inner circle, it was not entirely unexpected.

In December, for the first time in a decade, US officials had flown to Damascus, where they met with Ahmad Al-Sharaa, the commander of Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham, which just two weeks earlier had led the dramatic overthrow of the Bashar Assad regime after 14 years of civil war.

As a result of that meeting, after which the US delegation said it had found Al-Sharaa to be wholly “pragmatic,” the US removed the longstanding $10 million bounty on his head. A month later, Al-Sharaa was appointed president of Syria.

The day after last week’s investment forum in Riyadh, Trump sat down for a face-to-face meeting with Al-Sharaa that produced what might well prove to be one of the most historic photographs in the region’s recent history: the Saudi crown prince, flanked by Trump and Al-Sharaa, standing in front of the flags of the US, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.

The photograph sent a clear message: For the US, and for a region all too often subject to the whims of its largesse and military approbation, all bets were off.

The day before, Trump had more surprises for his delighted audience at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center.

“I have never believed in having permanent enemies,” the president said, and “I am willing to end past conflicts and forge new partnerships for a better and more stable world, even if our differences may be very profound, which obviously they are in the case of Iran.”

He praised local leadership for “transcending the ancient conflicts and tired divisions of the past” and criticized “Western interventionists … giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs.”

In a message that will have echoed loudly in Kabul, Baghdad, and even Tehran, he added: “In the end, the so-called ‘nation-builders’ wrecked far more nations than they built — and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.”

Responding to Trump’s announcements, Sir John Jenkins, a seasoned diplomat who served as British ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria, and as consul-general in Jerusalem, told Arab News: “I think this could be a real turning point.

“Post-Arab Spring demographics — lots of young people wanting a better life and better governance but not wanting to get there through ideology or revolution — and Mohammed bin Salman, Trump, and Syria have all come together at a singular time.”

Trump’s speech last week in Riyadh, he said, “was extraordinary, an intellectually coherent argument, and he means it.

“If you can form a cohesive bloc of Sunni states — the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the rest of the GCC, Jordan, Syria and Egypt — which all aim in different ways to increase prosperity and stability instead of the opposite, then you potentially have a bloc that can manage regional stability and contain Iran in a way we haven’t had for decades. And that gives the US the ability to pivot.”

But a lot could still go wrong. “Iran, which is already trying hard to undermine Syria, will continue to play games,” said Jenkins.

“And then there’s Israel itself: Does it want strong and stable Sunni neighbors or not? It should do, but I’m not sure Bezalel Smotrich (Israel’s far-right finance minister, who this month vowed that Gaza would be ‘entirely destroyed’) and Itamar Ben-Gvir (the minister of national security who is pressing for Israel to seize and occupy Gaza) think so. That’s a headache for Israel’s Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu.

“But if you hook all this up to a possible US-Iran deal, which will give Iran incentives not to have sanctions come crashing back down, then there’s something there.”

For Al-Sharaa, even six months ago, the dramatic turnaround in his personal circumstances would have seemed fantastic, and as such is symptomatic of the tectonic upheavals presaged by Trump’s visit to the region.

Almost exactly 12 years ago, on May 16, 2013, the then-leader of the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, judged responsible for “multiple suicide attacks throughout Syria” targeting the Assad regime, had been designated as a terrorist by the US Department of State.

Now, as the very public beneficiary of the praise and support of Trump and the Saudi crown prince, Al-Sharaa’s metamorphosis into the symbol of hope for the Syrian people is emblematic of America’s dramatic new approach to the region.

In Doha, the president chose the occasion of a visit to a US military base to make nice with Iran, a country whose negotiators have been quietly meeting in Oman with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, to discuss a nuclear deal.

“I want them to succeed,” said Trump, who in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the US from the original deal, fashioned by President Barack Obama and European allies, and reimposed economic sanctions. Now, he said in Doha last week, “I want them to end up being a great country.”

Iran, he added, “cannot have a nuclear weapon.” But, in a snub to Israel, which has reportedly not only sought US permission to attack Iranian enrichment facilities, but has even asked America to take part, he added: “We are not going to make any nuclear dust in Iran. I think we’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this.”

In fact, Trump’s entire trip appeared to be designed as a snub to Israel, which did not feature on the itinerary.

A week ahead of the trip, Trump had announced a unilateral ceasefire deal with the Houthis in Yemen, who had sided with Hamas after Israel mounted its retaliatory war in Gaza in October 2023.

Under the deal, brokered by Oman and with no Israeli involvement, the US said it would halt its strikes in Yemen in exchange for the Houthis agreeing to stop targeting vessels in the Red Sea.

On May 12, the day before Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia, Hamas released Edan Alexander, the last surviving US citizen held hostage in Gaza, in a deal that came out of direct talks with no Israeli involvement.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump celebrated “a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war.”

Trump, said Ahron Bregman, a former Israeli soldier and a senior teaching fellow in King’s College London’s Institute of Middle Eastern Studies, “threw Netanyahu, in fact Israel, under the bus.

“He totally surprised Netanyahu with a series of Middle Eastern diplomatic initiatives, which, at least from an Israeli perspective, hurt — indeed, humiliate — Israel,” he told Arab News.

“In the past, if one wished to get access to the White House, a good way to do so was to turn to Israel, asking them to open doors in Washington. Not any longer. Netanyahu, hurt and humiliated by Trump, seems to have lost his magic touch.

“Trump despises losers, and he probably regards Netanyahu as a loser, given the Gaza mess and Netanyahu’s failure to achieve Israel’s declared aims.”

It is, Bregman said, Trump’s famously transactional approach to politics that is shifting the dial so dramatically in the Middle East.

“Trump looks at international relations and diplomacy through financial lenses, as business enterprises. For Trump, money talks and the money is not to be found in Israel, which sucks $3 billion dollars a year from the US, but in the Gulf states.

“Trump is serious about America First, and Israel doesn’t serve this aim; the Gulf states do. For now, at least, the center of gravity has moved to the Gulf states, and the Israeli status in the Middle East has weakened dramatically.”

For Ibrahim Al-Marashi, associate professor at California State University, San Marcos, the events of the past week stand in sharp contrast to those during Trump’s first presidency.

“During the first Trump administration, World War Three almost broke out, with aircraft carriers from my native San Diego deployed continuously to the Gulf to deter Iran, the (Houthi) strike on Saudi Aramco, and the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad at the beginning of 2020,” he told Arab News.

“Five years later, the Trump administration seems to be repeating the Nixon-Kissinger realist doctrine: ‘America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests.’ In that regard, his administration might forge relations with Iran as Nixon did with China.”

Kelly Petillo, program manager for the Middle East and North Africa at the European Council on Foreign Relations, likewise views last week’s events as the beginning of “a new phase of US-Gulf relations.”

Among the remarkable developments is “Israel’s relative sidelining and the fact that Israel does not have the privileged relationship with Trump it thought it had,” she told Arab News. “The US agenda now is wider than unconditional support to Israel, and alignment with GCC partners is also key.

“Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE have clearly become of key strategic importance to the US, with new deals on the horizon and the promise of expanding these relations. The announcements of more commercial ties have been accompanied with political declarations too, which overall represented positive developments for the region.”

Ultimately, said Caroline Rose, a director at the New Lines Institute, “Trump’s visit to the GCC highlighted two of his foreign policy priorities in the Middle East.

“Firstly, he sought to obtain a series of transactional, bilateral cooperation agreements in sectors such as defense, investment and trade,” she told Arab News.

“The second objective was to use the trip as a mechanism that could change conditions for ongoing diplomatic negotiations directly with Iran, between Hamas and Israel, and even Ukraine and Russia.”

It was, of course, no accident that Trump chose the Middle East as the destination for the first formal overseas trip of his second presidency.

“The Trump administration sought to court Gulf states closely to signal to other partners in the region, such as Israel, as well as the EU, that it can develop alternative partnerships to achieve what it wants in peace negotiations.”

Although a strategy to move forward with specific peace negotiations was “notably absent during his trip,” it was clear that “this trip was designed to lay the groundwork for potential momentum and to change some of the power dynamics with traditional US partners abroad, sowing the seeds of goodwill that could alter negotiations in the Trump administration’s favor.”",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2601563/middle-east,World
Netanyahu sets implementation of Trump’s Gaza relocation plan as new condition for ending war,"During his first press conference in five months, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday named the implementation of US President Donald Trump’s “revolutionary” plan to relocate Gaza’s civilians as a condition for ending the conflict, the first time he has made such a demand. He called Trump’s plan “brilliant,” and said it had the potential to change the face of the Middle East.

The fledgling Operation Gideon’s Chariots — the IDF’s expanded ground operation in Gaza that began over the weekend— is meant to “complete the war, the work” in the enclave, the premier told reporters and live TV cameras at the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem.

Israel has a “very organized” plan to achieve its war aims in Gaza, he insisted, saying its aims are “To defeat Hamas, which carried out the atrocities of October 7; to bring back all of our hostages; and to ensure that Gaza does not present a threat to Israel.”

“Our forces are landing powerful blows that will get stronger against Hamas strongholds that still exist in Gaza,” he explained, promising that by the end of the operation, “all the territory of Gaza will be under Israeli security control, and Hamas will be totally defeated.”

While “ready to end the war,” Netanyahu said he would only agree to do so “under clear conditions that will ensure the safety of Israel: All the hostages come home, Hamas lays down its arms, steps down from power, its leadership is exiled from the Strip… Gaza is totally disarmed; and we carry out the Trump plan. A plan that is so correct and so revolutionary.”

The US and Israel share a determination to ensure that Iran cannot get the bomb and that Hamas is booted out of Gaza, he said. And “we want to ensure that Trump’s plan” for Gaza comes to fruition, he added. “It’s a brilliant plan,” he said, “that truly can bring change not only here… but can change the face of the Middle East. Change once and for all what we have been through from Gaza for decades.”

He also said that if there is a possibility for a “temporary ceasefire” that will return more hostages, he would agree to that, but repeated that this would only be temporary.

“We will win — and it won’t take another year and a half. I don’t want to reveal the plans, but it will happen. We will reach a decisive outcome and a different future for Gaza,” said Netanyahu.

PM says Qatar ‘not a friendly country,’ but didn’t fund Oct. 7

Asked about the ongoing Qatargate scandal, Netanyahu stated he “didn’t know anything” about his aides allegedly getting money from Qatar to boost the Gulf nation’s image, and that he “still doesn’t know” what happened.

Netanyahu claimed that he publicly attacked Qatar — one of the main mediators between Israel and Hamas in hostage talks — while others praised them, and that Israel is primarily using them to help get the hostages out.

“Qatar is not a friendly country,” he said, noting that Doha still supports Hamas, and that he is allowing a Knesset bill defining Qatar as a “terror-supporting state” to advance.

“Maybe the time has come to say the things in the clearest way possible, to our American friends as well. We are saying it,” he said, adding that maintaining contact with Qatar on the hostage issue must be included as an exception within the bill.

Netanyahu also claimed money controversially transferred by Qatar to Hamas was given “on the recommendation of the Shin Bet and the Mossad,” though the head of the security agency at the time has said he opposed the funds. The prime minister denied that this money, transferred at his urging, enabled the October 7, 2023, terror onslaught, which marked the deadliest attack in Israel’s history and day for Jews since the Holocaust.

Seeming to downplay the lethal capabilities of Hamas, Netanyahu said members of the terror group “attacked us in flip-flops and with AK-47s and pickup trucks, which cost scraps.” He said no tunnels that Hamas might have built with the money penetrated Israel because he had ordered an underground barrier built. Hamas did not have F-35s or tanks, he also said.

Thousands of Hamas members and other terrorists who breached the border on October 7 were highly trained and heavily armed, reports have shown, and operated within the 24 battalions of Hamas’s Qassem Brigades military wing. They held prior exercises, attacked in coordinated waves, and broke through the border in dozens of locations using anti-tank missiles, encrypted communications, naval commando units, and hang-gliders.

Falsely claims that Kibbutz Ein HaShlosha was not attacked

Netanyahu agreed that the failures of October 7 must be investigated and fully examined —“Everyone will bear the true responsibility. We need an objective commission, unbiased.”

“How did it happen that there was no one next to the fence. How did it happen that there was a directive not to be next to the fence,” he asked. “How did it happen that the Air Force received orders to operate only hours after the attack. How did it happen?”

He claimed there was one kibbutz, Ein HaShlosha, where that alleged directive was not given, “and nothing happened there — the community was not invaded, and the terrorists were killed.”

Members of the Gaza border kibbutz later expressed shock at Netanyahu’s claim that “nothing” happened there on October 7; in fact, four members were murdered. “We were surprised and shocked by the prime minister’s blatant inaccuracy as if ‘nothing happened in Ein Hashlosha.’ This is an outrageous and grave remark that harms the memory of those murdered and the entire community.”

“On the most difficult morning in the state’s history, members of the security squad and residents heroically faced dozens of terrorists who breached the kibbutz,” the statement added. “This was also presented in the IDF’s probe. During the battle, four of our beloved residents were murdered: Rami Negbi, Noa Glazberg, Silvia Mirensky and Marcelle Taljah. They aren’t ‘nothing.’”

The kibbutz residents demanded a correction and invited Netanyahu to Ein Hashlosha “to meet the community and hear the story of Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha.”

Netanyahu’s office attempted damage control, claiming in a statement later Wednesday that his remarks about Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha were misunderstood, and avoiding admitting Netanyahu misspoke. The statement asserted that what he meant was that the kibbutz not receiving a directive to not act caused the kibbutz’s people to spring into action, adding that the local security squad “fought bravely and prevented the takeover of the kibbutz and a big massacre.”

“There was no intention to say no residents were murdered at all. The prime minister grieves with the four families whose loved ones were murdered on October 7, along with the rest of the families whose loved ones were murdered and hurt in the massacre in all communities.”

The government has not formed any commission of inquiry into the events surrounding October 7, 2023, for 19 months, and opposes a state commission of inquiry, which successive polls show is the preferred option for most Israelis.

“This will be examined, and I will give answers, just like everyone else,” he said, after he was asked why he has not resigned because of the October 7 failures or called elections to seek a renewed mandate from the public. But I am already being held accountable by the public every day. Every week there’s the possibility of a no-confidence vote. And once a no-confidence vote passes — the public has already made its decision. That will also happen in elections, when the time comes,” he said.

“Do you want elections now? he asked. “Do you want me to list what we’re up against right now? Is that what we need — a commission of inquiry right now — when all our soldiers and commanders will be running around dressing up as lawyers instead of arming themselves with artillery shells and tank munitions?”

Now, “in the middle of a war,” is not the time, argued the premier.

Trump’s ‘absolute commitment’

Asked about reports of a growing rift between him and Trump, Netanyahu asserted that Israel’s relations with the United States are positive, and that the US president’s warming relations with Arab states in the Middle East do not worry him.

Netanyahu said he was assured by Trump and US Vice President JD Vance in recent days that America has Israel’s back.

“A few days ago — I think around 10 days ago, maybe a little more — I spoke on the phone with President Trump. And he said to me, literally: ‘Bibi, I want you to know — I have absolute commitment to you. I have absolute commitment to the State of Israel,” said the premier.

He added that “Just a few days ago, I spoke with Vice President Vance. He said to me… ‘Listen, don’t pay attention to all this fake news about this rupture between us… It’s all spin. This isn’t the truth, you know it’s not true, and I’m telling you, from our side, it’s not true’.”

“We’re coordinated with the [Trump] administration,” continued Netanyahu, “We speak with each other. We respect their interests, and they respect ours — and they overlap. I won’t tell you they align completely, obviously not, but they align almost completely.”

Netanyahu expressed support for Trump’s objectives of tightening relations with Gulf nations in the Middle East, demonstrated by the president’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates last week, saying his American counterpart’s moves could serve Israel by facilitating additional Abraham Accords normalization agreements.

“I have no objection to the United States deepening its ties in the Arab world. That’s absolutely fine. And I’ll tell you even more — I believe that can actually help expand the Abraham Accords, which I’m very invested in. I’m interested in that.”

During the roughly two-and-a-half years in which he and Trump’s first administration prepared the Abraham Accords — which saw Israel normalize ties with Bahrain, the UAE, and Morocco — Gulf states were speaking very harshly about Israel, said Netanyahu.

“But beneath the surface, something very different was happening. And I think there’s a possibility that this could happen again. I would be very happy if it does, because it’s one of my goals,” he said.

Saudi Arabia was in advanced talks on joining the Accords in 2023, backed by then-president Joe Biden’s administration, before the October 7 onslaught by Hamas against Israel that same year sparked the ongoing war and disrupted the normalization process.

“I’ve always wanted to expand the circle of peace, to extend a hand to our friends and push back the sword of our enemies. I’m very determined in this, and I’m focused on it,” said Netanyahu.

Europe ‘will not influence us’

Addressing Jerusalem’s relations with Europe, Netanyahu said that harsh rhetoric and punitive actions, including sanctions, from European nations demanding an end to the war in Gaza “will not influence” Israel’s national security policies.

“European countries will not influence us and they will not cause us to abandon our core objectives — ensuring the security of Israel and the future of Israel,” said Netanyahu in response to a question on how he plans to respond to severe condemnation of Israel’s actions in Gaza by European allies.

In recent days, European nations have called on Israel to halt its expanded military campaign in the Strip and lift restrictions on humanitarian aid for Gazan civilians.

In his opening remarks at the press conference, Netanyahu said that his decision to resume aid deliveries to the Strip on Sunday, a move deeply unpopular among right-wing Israelis, was made to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and maintain support from Israel’s allies.

Stressing that Hamas loots aid shipments and sells the supplies at exorbitant prices to fund its military activities, Netanyahu said that Israel developed along with the US a humanitarian aid plan to bypass Hamas members. US Ambassador Mike Huckabee earlier this month claimed it was an American plan, not an Israeli plan.

Netanyahu said the plan has three stages – the entry of “basic food now” into Gaza to prevent a humanitarian crisis; opening aid distribution points in the coming days by private US companies; and creating a “sterile zone” in southern Gaza for the civilian population to shelter in.

“In this zone, which will be totally free of Hamas, residents of Gaza will receive full humanitarian aid,” he explained.

On Monday evening, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney threatened in a joint statement to take “concrete actions” against Israel if it refuses to halt its military campaign and address the need for aid in Gaza, as well as pause the expansion of West Bank settlements and work toward a two-state solution. The leaders called the minimal supplies Israel permitted on Sunday “wholly inadequate.”

On Tuesday, the United Kingdom announced a pause in free trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers, while the European Union agreed to review its cooperation deal with Israel, citing alleged human rights abuses in Gaza.

“We will do what is necessary to complete the war,” said the premier when asked if Israel is prepared to accept such threats and sanctions from Europe in pursuit of its war goals.

“It is a badge of shame that Britain, instead of imposing sanctions on Hamas, is imposing sanctions on a woman who is threatened daily on the roads of Judea and Samaria by Hamas terrorists,” Netanyahu said, likely referring to veteran settler leader Daniella Weiss, who was among those sanctioned by the UK.

“All those images — the hunger, the claims that ‘44,000 children are about to die’ — all of that false propaganda echoes over there, and they cave to it,” said the premier, possibly referring to a debunked UN claim earlier this week that 14,000 babies in Gaza would soon die if proper nutrition doesn’t reach them.

“It’s a total loss of moral direction. These countries are under pressure — from the Islamic minority within them, and from public opinion shaped by Hamas’s false propaganda,” the premier said.

“The sanctions that are truly concerning,” said Netanyahu, would be imposed by the United Nations Security Council. “Binding sanctions — a resolution we will not allow,” he emphasized.

According to Netanyahu, as a condition for a deal releasing hostages and ending the war, Hamas would demand that the Security Council pass binding sanctions to damage Israel’s economy and national security were it to resume fighting the terror group at a later time — thus necessitating that Israel finish the job now.

Such an agreement would require a guarantee from the US, a crucial mediator in the hostage-ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, not to veto such sanctions in the initial vote.

“This is Hamas’s goal,” he said. “They want to stop the war, end it, and push through a binding Security Council resolution — one that would compel 180 countries to impose sanctions on us.”

He said those who argue for Israel to end the war on Hamas’s terms “forget that it won’t come for free. You’d have to evacuate the entire Gaza Strip. There would be a binding resolution in the Security Council that would crash Israel’s economy completely, and also our security systems. It’s insane. Simply insane,” he continued.

Netanyahu also rejected the prospect of European nations unilaterally recognizing a Palestinian state.

“We strongly oppose their intention to give Hamas the ultimate prize — to recognize a Palestinian state. After October 7 — after we saw what a de facto Palestinian state looks like — it was called Gaza. Hamas’s Gaza. Hamastan. And now they want to create another one? There is no greater reward for terror,” he said.

Slams Yair Golan, who threatens to sue him

Addressing former IDF deputy chief of staff and current Democrats party leader Yair Golan’s much-panned accusation on Tuesday that Israel is killing Palestinian children for sport, Netanyahu called the statement “appalling.”

“While our heroic soldiers are risking their lives in the Gaza Strip, in order to protect our country and to bring our hostages back, Yair Golan accuses them of war crimes,” he said, adding that it reminded him of medieval blood libels.

It is Hamas that kills children as a hobby, while Israeli soldiers are doing everything they can to avoid civilian casualties, insisted Netanyahu. “There is no army that is more moral than the IDF in the world.”

Netanyahu said that those who defend Golan and repeat such charges fuel antisemitism and back Golan so as to bring down his government. They are willing to do anything to achieve that goal, he argued, including losing the ongoing war.

In response, Golan said: “I saw a display by a lying, anxious and troubled man who slings mud at everyone and doesn’t take responsibility for anything.

“I have two promises to Netanyahu this evening: I will sue you for defamation for the lies you spread against me, and we will beat you in elections very soon and send you to the pages of history,” vowed Golan.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid slammed Netanyahu for the vision for the Gaza war he laid out at the press conference.

“The meaning of Netanyahu’s words is military rule over Gaza for many years,” Lapid said, adding that soldiers will continue to die in battle and Israeli taxpayers will have to pay for education, healthcare and other services in Gaza.

“Netanyahu lied today when he said he is fully coordinated with the American administration,” Lapid also contended. “He has lost Trump’s support and attention.”",https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-implementation-of-trumps-gaza-relocation-plan-is-condition-for-ending-war/,World

Talks to start on recognition of state of Palestine by western states,"Talks will start on Friday at an official level about the possibility of recognising the state of Palestine.

A senior Arab diplomat in London said:“If you asked me a fortnight ago if there will be wider recognition [of Palestine] by western states I would have said no, but now I am not so sure.”

The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, suspended trade talks with Israel on Tuesday and described its refusal to lift a blockade of aid into Gaza as “abominable”.

Lammy spoke to the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, on Wednesday about the barriers blocking aid.



The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said this week: “We cannot leave the children of Gaza a legacy of violence and hatred. So all this must stop and that’s why we are determined to recognise a Palestinian state.”

The developments come ahead of a UN-sponsored conference in New York starting on 17 June, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.

Officials at the conference will have to discuss the context for such a recognition of the state of Palestine. One question is whether there would need to be parallel recognition of Israel by states such as Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, something that is regarded as impossible in the absence of a clear path to a two-state solution.

Israel is adamantly opposed to a two-state solution. The new US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, in an interview in Haarezt newspaper resisted the idea, saying: “I am asking whether there truly needs to be a Palestinian state.”

One of the issue under discussion is whether recognising Palestine would have implications for companies or individuals who trade in the occupied territories.

UK ministers are not expecting to announce further measures in the near future, but neither Jordan nor the UK has ruled out using air drops as was attempted last year.

MPs are concerned that arms companies may be using the partial nature of the arms export ban imposed last September by the UK to send weaponry to Israel for use in Gaza, in breach of an undertaking by ministers.

Three ministers responsible for arms exports to Israel have been summoned by parliament’s committee overseeing UK exports to explain possible loopholes in the rules.

Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee ordered the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, and the relevant ministers from the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence to offer urgent explanations.

In his letter, Byrne raises concerns about statistics published on Friday that showed that in the fourth quarter of 2024 – after Labour’s partial arms export ban to Israel was imposed – the UK government approved licences for £127.6m of military equipment to Israel. This is greater than the combined total for 2020-23, according to Campaign against the Arms Trade.

Challenged on these figures by the independent MP Zarah Sultana in the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Lammy said he did not recognise the number and accused her of sensationalising the issue. He assured MPs: “Arms are not getting to Israel that could be used in Gaza.”

However, the latest figures show the government authorised more than £61m in single-issue licences for military goods with an end user in Israel. These included licences for goods categories covering targeting systems, munitions and military aircraft parts.

In his letter, Byrne pointed out that ministers assured MPs that the ban covered “equipment that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza, such as important components that go into military aircraft, including fighter aircraft, helicopters and drones, as well as items that facilitate ground targeting”.

He has asked for an explanation for the increase and the proportion of arms going to the Israeli state.

He has also asked for the release of statistics on the number of licences that have been changed to remove Israel as the end user.

The high court last week conducted a four-day judicial review of the UK government’s claim that it was lawful for the UK to sell components for F-35 fighter jets indirectly to Israel even though there was an acknowledged ministerial acceptance that those parts could be transferred for use in planes to bomb Gaza.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/21/talks-to-start-on-british-recognition-of-state-of-palestine,World
His Highness the Aga Khan concludes visit to Qatar,"Doha, Qatar, 22 May 2025 – His Highness the Aga Khan today concluded a visit to Qatar, where he met with His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, His Excellency Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Prime Minister, Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad Al Thani, Chairperson of Qatar Museums, and His Excellency Sheikh Thani bin Hamad Al Thani, Chairperson of Qatar Fund for Development, to strengthen collaboration in global development and culture.

Two agreements were signed during the visit: a Memorandum of Understanding between the Aga Khan Development Network and the Qatar Fund for Development that aims to advance inclusive and sustainable development, particularly in support of countries facing urgent and multifaceted challenges; and a collaboration agreement between the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Qatar Museums.

The agreements will enable deeper collaboration in regions of common interest, including Central and South Asia and the Middle East, in fields such as economic empowerment, health care, climate resilience, education, training for heritage preservation, urban revitalisation and music.

The visit continues the enduring engagement of the Ismaili Imamat with countries in the Gulf region, including the State of Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman.

Islamic Development Bank and International Committee of the Red Cross Sign Operational Framework Agreement to Strengthen Collaboration in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Contexts,"Algiers, 21 May 2025. The signing of the Operational Framework Agreement (OFA) between the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) represents a strategic milestone in advancing partnerships for principled, scalable and long-term solutions in fragile and conflict-affected settings. It reflects a shared vision to address compounded crises particularly in contexts where operational access and sustainable financing are both limited and essential.

Building on a collaboration initiated in 2017 and formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding in 2019, the OFA establishes a structured platform for operational and financial collaboration. It seeks to enhance the complementarity between the ICRC’s humanitarian mandate and field presence, and IsDB’s role as a multilateral development bank focused on recovery and resilience-building.

The OFA is aligned with the findings of the 2025 Resilience Report, jointly launched by IsDB and ICRC on 20 May 2025. The report underscores the need for integrated responses to the compounding effects of conflict, climate change and fragility. It also highlights the importance of inclusive and collaborative approaches across humanitarian, development, state and community actors to ensure sustainable impact in these complex environments.

The ICRC–IsDB partnership has pioneered delivering impact in high-risk contexts. IsDB’s early grant financing in countries such as Sudan and Afghanistan has not only enabled rapid humanitarian response but has also mobilized broader engagement by other development partners. This approach, linking early action with longer-term investments, offers a blueprint for a catalytic funding model the OFA is designed to reinforce.

The road-tested ICRC-IsDB collaboration in contexts such as the Sahel, the Horn of Africa or Yemen illustrates how early, context-specific action can mitigate risk and limit the impact of foreseeable shocks. Activities such as climate-resilient infrastructure investments, livelihood protection and anticipatory measures have proven effective, even in contested environments. In all contexts, the protection of civilians and essential infrastructure - facilitated through respect for international humanitarian law - remains a core enabler of sustained resilience.

The Agreement provides a framework for collaboration between the two institutions to drive joint action in fragile and conflict-affected contexts where their mandates are complementary. It aims to support multi-year, conflict-sensitive, and climate-resilient programming, while also strengthening coordination between ICRC delegations and IsDB regional hubs. In addition, the partnership will focus on developing initiatives under the Tadamon platform and other fit-for-purpose financing mechanisms, and on reinforcing local response capacity as well as protecting critical civilian infrastructure and essential services.

The OFA serves not only as a framework but also allows both institutions to develop a platform for more coherent and holistic responses, supporting systemic resilience, continuity of essential services and more predictable engagement where the needs are greatest.",https://www.isdb.org/news/islamic-development-bank-and-international-committee-of-the-red-cross-sign-operational-framework-agreement-to-strengthen-collaboration-in-fragile-and-conflict-affected-contexts,World
Gazans fear shutdown of water plants as Israel widens offensive,"Gazans fear shutdown of water plants as Israel widens offensive

12 hours ago Share Save Yolande Knell Middle East correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem Share Save

Anadolu via Getty Images Gaza's water resources are scarce after Israel cut off power lines to key desalination plants in March

Chronic shortages of water in Gaza are worsening as Israel's expanding military offensive causes new waves of displacement - and desalination and hygiene plants are running out of fuel. The UN's humanitarian office has said its partners are warning that, without immediate fuel deliveries, a full shutdown of water and sanitation facilities is possible by the end of the week. Days after Israel imposed its blockade on aid in early March - which is only now being eased - it also cut off power lines to the main desalination plants - a vital source of water for Gazans. It said these steps were to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages it is holding.

Donkey carts have continued to distribute water in recent days

Although Israel has said it will now permit the entry of basic supplies into Gaza, so far this has not included fuel. However, some drinking water was loaded on the dozens of UN lorries that have entered the strip - with supplies not yet distributed. Parents have told the BBC that during 19 months of war, their children have grown used to drinking salty water - with doctors saying they have seen a rise in serious kidney complaints as a result. ""Often the water turns out to be half sweet [fresh], half salty,"" said Raed al-Zaharneh, a father-of-four in Khan Younis who, like most Gazans, now relies on water delivered on lorries. ""We know it is undrinkable water, and we still drink it,"" he went on. ""We've had stomach pain and diarrhoea, but we put up with it. What do we do? We need to drink. There's no alternative.""

Jonathan Crickx of Unicef said production had reduced by 80% at a desalination plant in southern Gaza

Earlier this month, there was still a loud whirring sound at a desalination plant in southern Gaza as Jonathan Crickx of Unicef visited. He said that production at the site had been reduced by 80% after electricity was recently cut off. However, it was still producing thousands of litres per day. ""The problem is that to produce water we now need fuel,"" Mr Crickx said. ""And afterwards we need to truck the water to the different communities."" ""This is a difficult process as we have less and less fuel, not only to produce the water but to run the trucks."" While some lorries as well as donkey carts have continued to distribute water in recent days, the ramping up of Israel's military offensive and new waves of displacement - affecting some 140,000 people in the north and south of the strip - have made this even more challenging. The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) says that water and sanitation services have already been severely disrupted by ongoing fuel shortages. In northern Gaza, no fuel is currently available and only half the needed supply was received last week, Ocha says. This has meant the operating hours for water wells have been further reduced with complete shutdowns expected. In southern Gaza, Ocha says that UN water utilities have not received any fuel, although 140,000 litres of fuel per week are needed to keep them going. This has led to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities reducing their operating hours by more than one fifth.

New US intel suggests Israel readying to strike Iranian nuclear facilities — report,"New intelligence obtained by the United States suggests that Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing multiple US officials familiar with the intelligence.

It was not clear whether Israeli leaders have made a final decision and there was disagreement within the US government about whether they would ultimately decide to carry out strikes, CNN added, citing the officials.

The report could not immediately be confirmed. The National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.

The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond, nor did the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, which was contacted after hours.

One source familiar with the intelligence told CNN the likelihood of an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility “has gone up significantly in recent months.”

The person added that the chance of a strike would be more likely if the US reached a deal with Iran that did not remove all of the country’s uranium, CNN said.

US President Donald Trump’s administration has been conducting negotiations with Iran aimed at achieving a diplomatic deal over its nuclear program, and the CNN report quoted US officials as saying that an Israeli strike would mark a major break with Trump, who has repeatedly stressed his preference for a diplomatic resolution to the issue.

The new intelligence was based on the public and private communications from senior Israeli officials as well as intercepted Israeli communications and observations of Israeli military movements that could suggest an imminent strike, CNN reported.

CNN cited two sources saying that among the military preparations the US had observed were the movement of air munitions and the completion of an air exercise, though the report noted the moves could be part of an Israeli pressure campaign against Iran rather than an indicator of a possible strike.

Earlier on Tuesday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said US demands that Tehran stop enriching uranium are “excessive and outrageous,” state media reported, voicing doubts over whether the talks on a new nuclear deal would succeed.

With the negotiations ongoing, a source that CNN described as familiar with the Trump administration’s thinking said the US is unlikely to assist Israel in striking Iran’s nuclear program right now, while an American official said intelligence efforts were ramping up to help if Israeli leaders decide to attack.

The report also cited a source familiar with the matter saying that Israel does not have the means to take out Iran’s nuclear program without US help, though an Israeli source said Israel was ready to act alone if Washington negotiates a “bad deal” with Tehran that is unacceptable to Jerusalem.

“I think it’s more likely they strike to try and get the deal to fall apart if they think Trump is going to settle for a ‘bad deal,’” a person familiar with US intelligence told CNN. “The Israelis have not been shy about signaling that to us… both publicly and privately.”

CNN’s reporting follows a report in The New York Times last month on how Trump “waved off” a planned Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program that would require US military support.

While backing nuclear diplomacy, he has also warned of potential military action if it fails. Iran and the United States so far have held four rounds of Omani-mediated talks since April 12, the highest-level contact between the two foes since Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear accord in 2018 during his first term in office.

They had confirmed plans to hold another round of discussions during their last meeting on May 11, which Iran described as “difficult but useful,” while a US official said Washington was “encouraged.”

Trump has said he presented Iran’s leadership with an “olive branch,” adding that it was an offer that would not last forever.

He last week threatened to impose “massive maximum pressure,” including driving Iranian oil exports to zero if talks failed.

Trump later doubled down on his warning, saying that “something bad is going to happen” unless the Iranians “move quickly” toward a deal. CNN reported that s senior Western diplomat who met with Trump said the US president indicated he would give the talks weeks before turning to a military option if no diplomatic breakthrough is reached.

The US and other Western countries have long accused Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons — a claim Tehran denies, insisting that its atomic program is solely for civilian purposes. But Iran, which openly seeks Israel’s destruction, has ramped up its enrichment of uranium to 60 percent purity, which has no peaceful application, and has obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-us-intel-suggests-israel-readying-to-strike-iranian-nuclear-facilities-report/,World
China the biggest winner of India-Pakistan air fight,"The loudest cheers of victory in the brief India-Pakistan war are congratulating the Pakistani pilots who flew Chinese-built jets firing impressive PL-15 missiles, purportedly enabling them to shoot down six of India’s French and Russian warplanes.

China is sharing Pakistan’s military success. Since the mid-20th century, China has been arming, investing in, and helping to construct Pakistan, which is a crucial nation in Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and a non-NATO ally of the US.

Pakistan is China’s only overland access to the Arabian Sea that opens onto the Indian Ocean and the Middle East’s vital petroleum shipping lanes.

“The confirmed kill of a sixth Indian Air Force jet, a Mirage 2000 near Pampore on the night of May 6-7, once again demonstrates the superior combat performance of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and the unwavering resolve of our armed forces to defend the motherland at any cost,” Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif said on May 16 while visiting a PAF base.

Pakistan claimed the six downed Indian aircraft included three Rafales armed with European-built air-to-air Meteor missiles, a French Mirage 2000 jet, one Russian-supplied SU-30MKI and one Russian MiG-29, plus a “loitering” Israeli-supplied Heron surveillance drone and dozens of “killer drones” built by Israel.

India avoided releasing details about the toll on its planes.

“When questioned on the status of the three downed Rafales, IAF [Indian Air Force] senior commander Air Marshal A K Bharti deflected with, ‘We are in a wartime scenario, losses are part of the battle’ — a remark seen by many analysts as an implicit confirmation,” Malaysia-based Defense Security Asia reported.



“To regional military observers, the vagueness of Bharti’s response only reinforces the credibility of Pakistan’s narrative surrounding the shootdowns,” it said.

Meanwhile, the PAF satirized “India’s nine billion dollar dream!” as New Delhi’s waste of money after recent military purchases.

Mocking India’s international embarrassment and purported losses, the PAF posted online a “PAF mess breakfast these days”, which showed a photograph of the cantonment restaurant’s new handwritten “Air Defense Officers Mess” menu.

The PAF’s two-course meal featured only French toast and Russian salad. Pakistan’s US-built F-16s and other aircraft supported the Chinese JF-17s and J-10s against India, Pakistan’s Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed said.

Pakistan’s Army Chief Asim Munir, describing Kashmir, vowed in April: “Our stance is very clear, it was our jugular vein, it will be our jugular vein.”

Compared to the growing military entwining of Beijing and Islamabad, the US. and Pakistan have had much more extensive defense and security links for decades.

Those military links include mutual support during Washington’s failed 20-year-long war in Afghanistan, and its earlier disastrously counter-productive support for Afghanistan’s hardline Islamist “holy warrior” mujahideen during the Soviet Union’s 10-year occupation.

Pakistan’s secretive relations with Afghanistan’s Taliban along their disputed British colonial-imposed Durand Line border soured dialogue with the US over the years.

Islamabad’s battle in the sky against New Delhi, however, appears to have attracted fresh US support.

“When India hit back with precision and restraint, it wasn’t Pakistan that reversed the tide of battle. It was Washington,” wrote New Delhi-based opinion columnist Brahma Chellaney on The Hill’s op-ed page.

“The Trump administration stepped in at a pivotal moment, using coercive leverage to compel India to cease its operation prematurely. In doing so, Trump not only spared Pakistan the consequences of its actions, but also damaged the foundation of US-India strategic trust,” Chellaney said.

“Pakistan was never a technical ally of the United States. I mean there was no treaty of alliance with Pakistan,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said in January.

Pakistan’s non-NATO ally status includes priority military partnership, but unlike NATO or Five Eyes, the US and Pakistan are not committed to defending each other or sharing intelligence.

Pakistan’s robust retaliation against India’s bombardments during their four-day battle surprised many after Islamist insurgents killed 26 Indian civilians on April 22 in Pahalgam, an idyllic, forested Himalayan tourist town in Indian-controlled Kashmir state.

Pakistan denied supporting the Islamists’ slaughter of civilians. Both sides claimed dozens of civilians perished in the ensuing battles. India said it vaporized Islamist fighters and their secretive gathering sites inside Pakistan.

Various Muslim rebel groups, some based in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and others inside India’s Muslim-majority Kashmir, want either autonomy for Indian-held Kashmir, reunification with Pakistani-held Kashmir, or independence for a united Kashmir.

Despite being unable or unwilling to provide evidence that Islamabad arranged the killings, Hindu-majority India unleashed its military assault against Pakistan. India later issued some tough rhetoric after a ceasefire took hold.

“India will only engage with Pakistan on two issues, terrorism and the return of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, ruling out any possibility of normal diplomatic dialogue,” announced Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

China’s role in bloodying India’s Air Force during their attacks dates back to 2022 when Pakistan’s Air Force received its first six J-10 fighter jets, built by Chengdu Aircraft Corp., and dubbed them “dragons from the East.”

Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of China-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine said at the time:

“The J-10CE is an export variant of the J-10C, one of the best light-duty, multirole combat planes in the world, and also one of the [Chinese] People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s most powerful pieces of hardware.

“The plane is able to fire missiles from beyond visual range. Together with its long flight range, the jet will substantially extend the PAF’s [Pakistan Air Force’s] operational radius, and give it more time to handle suspected intrusions.

“Moreover, the J-10CE can carry out precision strikes against land targets, offering its user more options when planning military operations,” Wang said.

After a tenuous ceasefire began with India, the air-to-air PL-15 missiles’ performance and the Pakistani pilots’ maneuverability gained China international publicity and heightened perceptions of Chinese ingenuity and military prowess.

“The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the US military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive told Reuters.

“The United States is developing the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile via Lockheed Martin partly in response to the PL-15 and its beyond-visual-range performance – part of a broader reset of Western priorities toward China,” Reuters reported.

Increased Chinese weapons sales to Islamabad and other envious capitals may soon result.

“In its first battlefield test against Western arms, Chinese weapons mostly hit the mark, sparking interest in some military circles and alarm in some capitals,” France 24 reported.

China sells its biggest proportion of weapons to Pakistan, according to Sweden’s Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In turn, Islamabad buys most of its weapons from Beijing. Other top arms dealers to Pakistan include Turkey, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ukraine.

International weapons industry chatter expects China’s J-10CE jet fighter will attract Egyptian, Iranian and Saudi buyers now that the aircraft has been proven in battle.

China had been selling lower-quality jet fighters mostly to impoverished Bangladesh, Zambia, Sudan and North Korea.

A China-friendly Pakistan pleases Beijing because it can stack the country’s military, intelligence agencies, and public against their joint former wartime enemy – India. All three nations have nuclear weapons.

“Tremendous amounts of diplomatic efforts, including by China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, helped broker the truce,” government-controlled China Daily reported.

“Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had telephone conversations respectively with Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, and Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar on May 10.”

“Given the important role China plays in the region, particularly its close relations with Pakistan — which quickly gained the upper hand in the conflict after India’s first wave of attacks — it is fair to say Beijing played a key role in helping to calm the situation,” China Daily reported.

Elsewhere in Pakistan, Chinese BRI personnel are being killed by a separate force, on the ground, comprised of minority ethnic Baloch and Islamist guerrillas that General Munir is unable to contain.

A smoldering insurgency for independence led by the Balochistan Liberation Army launches hit-and-run assaults against Chinese engineers and other personnel in Balochistan province’s rugged, stony desert, which borders southeast Iran and southeast Afghanistan.

Resource-rich but undeveloped, Balochistan is Pakistan’s biggest province, comprising about 45% of the country, including Quetta, its provincial capital.

Almost 100 Chinese personnel sent to Pakistan to work in Balochistan and elsewhere on US$70 billion BRI projects have been killed by insurgents during the past several years, amid complaints that China is muscling in on the province to profit from, and exploit, locals.

Further north near the legendary Khyber Pass, the Islamist insurgents Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan and Islamic State Khorasan have also been blamed for anti-Chinese assaults.

The BRI project is creating a China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) by upgrading infrastructure along a 1,800-mile (3,000-kilometer) route linking southwest China with Balochistan’s hammerhead-shaped peninsula and port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, close to the Persian Gulf.

When Marco Polo traveled from Venice to Beijing in the 13th Century, he journeyed via a Silk Road.

Supporters hail the CPEC as “a New Silk Road” reinvigorating various ancient Silk Roads which interconnected overland trade routes, including links from Kashgar, China’s southwest city in Xinjiang province, to the Arabian Sea on Pakistan’s south coast.

The corridor would enable goods to be transported to and from China on a streamlined Gwadar-Kashgar highway, connecting onward to all other Chinese cities.

Chinese engineers are also enlarging Gwadar’s deep-water port, operated by the China Overseas Port Holding Co, to handle Chinese ships transporting petroleum from the Persian Gulf to China.

That Arabian Sea route would be much shorter than the current shipping lanes, which depart the Middle East and route south around India, and then through the Malacca Strait, which is monitored by US-backed Singapore.

Chinese ships then head north via the disputed waters of the South China Sea to reach China’s ports. Gwadar and CPEC would cut those lengthy sea routes, bypass the Malacca Strait, and enable unloading of cargo at Gwadar for overland vehicle transport north to Xinjiang.

Gwadar also benefits from its close proximity to Karachi, a major port, capital of Sindh province and Pakistan’s financial, industrial, and cultural center with Arabian Sea beaches.

The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) sent more than 300 special operations, army aviation, and logistic support troops from its Western Theater Command in November 2024 to a three-week Pakistan-China Joint Exercise on Pakistani territory.

Beijing has its reasons to support a friend against New Delhi. China won its brief war against India in 1962, leaving both nations occupying territory claimed by the other.

Islamabad and New Delhi, however, fought four wars after being clumsily split apart by departing British colonialists when Pakistan and India gained independence in 1947.

Neither side won their 1947-1948 battle over the partition of Kashmir, which ended with a United Nations-mandated ceasefire and an internationally recognized Line of Control, which forms their current border.

Their 1965 war ended in a stalemate after Kashmir again fueled anger on both sides. The then-Soviet Union brokered a Tashkent Agreement, which did not change India’s hold on two-thirds of eastern Kashmir and Pakistan’s control over the remains of western Kashmir.

New Delhi defeated Islamabad in the 1971 war, which turned then-East Pakistan into independent Bangladesh and truncated the former West Pakistan into the Islamic republic’s current size.

India beat Pakistan again in their 1999 Kargil war amid Kashmir’s steep Himalayan glaciers, forcing Pakistani soldiers and insurgents to retreat from Kashmir.

International Tea Day: Spilling the tea on unusual brews around the world,"Tea is the most popular drink in the world with billions of cups drank every day.

Tea is the most popular drink in the world other than water. It beats out coffee and beer, which hold second and third place.

May 21 is designated as International Tea Day by the United Nations, marking the significance and value of the drink globally, not just economically but culturally too.

Tea plays a meaningful role in many societies. From Tibetan po cha to a good old English breakfast brew, tea is considered a unifying and hospitable beverage.

While the exact origins of tea are unknown, it is believed to have originated in northeast India, northern Myanmar and southwest China, according to the UN. There is evidence that tea was consumed in China 5,000 years ago, making it one of the oldest beverages in the world.

How to say tea around the world

Across the globe, nearly all words for tea can be derived from the root words “cha” or “te”.

In many parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, the word for tea is derived from cha.

In Mandarin: 茶 (chá)

In Arabic: شاي (shāy)

In Turkish: çay

In Hindi: चाय (chāi)

In Western Europe, many countries use some derivative of te. For example, “tea” was introduced into the English language as a result of trade routes in the East. The word was taken from China, where it was pronounced “te” in the Hokkien dialect.

In English: tea

In French: thé

In Spanish: té

In German: tee

Who produces the most tea globally?

The tea plant is usually grown in tropical and subtropical climates where its cultivation and processing support the livelihoods of millions of people.

According to the latest data from the Tea and Coffee Trade Journal‘s Global Tea Report, China produces nearly half of the world’s tea (48 percent). India is the second largest producer, accounting for 20 percent of world production, followed by Kenya (8 percent), Turkiye (4 percent) and Sri Lanka (3 percent).

The rest of the world accounts for 17 percent of tea production globally.

How much tea is consumed daily worldwide?

According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), world tea consumption reached 6.5 million tonnes in 2022, growing from previous years.

Consumption in China, the largest consumer of tea, reached 3 million tonnes in 2022, representing 46 percent of global consumption.

India, the second largest consumer, accounted for a share of nearly 18 percent at 1.16 million tonnes in 2022, followed by Turkiye with 250,000 tonnes, Pakistan with 247,000 tonnes and Russia with 133,000 tonnes.

According to the FAO, tea consumption expanded by 2 percent in 2022 compared with 2021 and further increased in 2023.

However, tea consumption in countries in Europe and North America has been declining due to increasing competition from other beverages while for Russia, tea imports have been negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine.

Five odd teas around the world

To mark this year’s International Tea Day, here are five somewhat unusual teas from around the world and how to make them:

Butter tea (po cha)

Found in: Tibet and other Himalayan regions

What’s odd?: It’s in the name. Made with yak butter, black tea and salt, butter tea is broth-like. Apparently, there is a tradition where the host will refill your cup with butter tea until you refuse or until they stop filling it, signalling it’s time for you to leave.

Kombucha – is it tea?

Found in: China, Japan and the Koreas

What’s odd?: Kombucha is considered a tea. It’s a fermented tea made using a jelly-like SCOBY (symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast). Kombucha fans often name their SCOBYs, treat them like pets and pass them to friends like family heirlooms.

Butterfly pea flower tea

Found in: Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam

What’s odd?: It is known as blue tea because of its colour, which then changes to purple when lemon juice is added. It’s caffeine free and made from a concoction of floral petals from the blue pea flower.

Baobab leaf tea

Found in: sub-Saharan Africa

What’s odd?: Baobab leaf tea is traditionally used in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa as a mild herbal remedy and nutritional drink.

Unlike most herbal teas, which are often floral or fruity, baobab leaf tea has a mildly earthy or even slightly bitter taste, a bit like spinach water.

Guava leaf tea

Found in: Philippines, Central America, Africa

Advertisement

What’s odd?: The tea is made from the leaves of the guava tree, which have an earthy flavour. In Philippine culture, it is said to have medicinal benefits for soothing stomach aches and bathing wounds.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/21/international-tea-day-spilling-the-tea-on-unusual-teas-around-the-world,World
Fact check: Did Chinese fighter jets deliver aid to Gaza? – DW – 05,"Footage allegedly showing Chinese aid deliveries to Gaza has gone viral on social media platforms. But the images are false.

Following an almost three-month blockade, Israel's government announced the decision to allow limited food aid into Gaza.

In the last few days, the debate around aid deliveries to the enclave has been accompanied by fake and misleading information online.

DW Fact check debunked some of the viral videos.

Is China providing aid from the sky?

Claim: This post on X from May 17, 2025, with over ten thousand views, purports to show China delivering aid by dropping it from the sky in Gaza.

Online videos have claimed China delivered aid by dropping it from the sky in Gaza. Image: X

DW Fact check: False

In the 32-second video, 20 to 30 packages are seen falling from the sky with parachutes attached.

The post is accompanied by a text listing Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, followed by numbers for each place. There is no reference to what these numbers mean.

The figures could refer to recently announced investments and economic exchange frameworks between those countries and the United States.

The post ends by claiming that the video shows China providing aid to Gaza from the sky.

A reverse image search leads us to photographs of airdrops done in Gaza with similar parachutes. Those humanitarian aid deliveries took place at the beginning of March 2024.

During that time, several countries dropped humanitarian aid from the sky in Gaza, as Israel blocked aid from crossing the border by land. This did not include China.

Highly limited aid deliveries

It is difficult to geolocate where the original video was taken because of the widespread destruction in Gaza and rapidly changing landmarks.

Additionally, there is limited access to Google Street View in Gaza.

The account that posted the video on X seems to belong to a woman from Pakistan who joined the platform in 2011.

She doesn't seem to be the person who took the video, as it previously appeared on another account at the beginning of April.

The video and claim circulated at a time when aid deliveries are highly limited, as Israel stopped deliveries of humanitarian aid in Gaza on March 2, 2025 .

On April 1st, the video gathered 52.3 million views on TikTok and the claim that China was responsible for the airdrop only came up in the comment section.

In the following days, several posts with the same video appeared. This one shares screenshots repeating the claim of China's involvement, and others combine different videos to make new edits and posts that have also gathered millions of views.

China has not released any official statements that it had airdropped aid into Gaza. The last reported deliveries of aid from the Chinese government date to February 19th this year and were transported in trucks .

Even as limited aid deliveries into Gaza have currently resumed, these only refer to land deliveries .

Did Chinese fighter jets fly over the pyramids on their way to Gaza?

Claim: This post on X , which has been viewed over 270,000 times, allegedly shows Chinese fighter jets and a Chinese cargo plane flying over the Great Pyramid of Giza complex in Egypt on their way to drop aid and supplies to Gaza.

This video does not show a delivery of aid by the Chinese military, but a joint military exercise between China and Egypt. Image: X

DW Fact check: False

The user who posted the clip on X on May 18, who identifies himself as a Kenyan parliamentary aspirant, describes the scenes as ""iconic images.""

A reverse image search of the clip reveals a large number of posts with similar messages on other platforms, including YouTube , TikTok , Instagram and Threads .

However, the footage is older and does not show aid delivery by the Chinese military.

A reverse image search shows clips suggesting that the images are from April and refer to a military drill unrelated to Gaza. Here's one social media example in Portuguese .

This context is further confirmed by an advanced internet search for military exercises in Egypt in the last few months.

In April, China and Egypt launched their first joint military training, codenamed ""Eagles of Civilization 2025,"" as confirmed here by the Egyptian government and here by the Chinese Ministry of Defence.

Several pictures of the joint exercises were published by news agencies, including those of military jets flying over the pyramids.

Furthermore, Chinese state-owned media outlet CGTN published video material of the exercise under the headline ""Jets over pyramids.""

Military aircraft flew in formation at the Giza pyramid complex, as China and Egypt conducted their first joint air force exercise. Image: Ryan Woo/REUTERS

Not the only false videos

The two false videos above are not the only ones that have circulated online in recent days.

Others include further videos taken out of context, like this one with 3 million likes on TikTok.

It was taken in October 2024 and included aid from the United States and France. The German armed forces also took part in this.

This other one was originally taken in March 2024, as Jordan opened the airlift to drop aid over Gaza.

Both also show military airplanes dropping aid from the sky, but the claim of Chinese involvement is false.
