Its chassis is made of die-cast aluminum with a plastic back and glass front. It’s rated IP64 for dust and splash resistance, which is pretty decent for a phone at this price. Note 60’s display has reinforced glass that makes it safe from scratches and fall damage.





Speaking of displays, the new Realme 4G mobile carries a massive 6.74” IPS LCD with a waterdrop notch. There’s only a 5MP front camera, so you might need to get comfortable with low-res selfies. A 560 nits typical brightness with 720p resolution is modest, but we do find its 90Hz refresh rate commendable.

It is presented with two camera lenses on the back, but there’s only one usable sensor here with a 32MP resolution, which can do 1080p 30FPS videos. The other lens is only for decorative purposes. This model is 7.8mm thin, a quality that isn’t easy to come by on an entry-level device.





You get a massive 5000mAh cell inside this phone, providing a decent one-day backup. The only caveat is the slow 10W charging. It might need more than two hours to refill. The Note 60 carries a weak Unisoc T612 processor, running a system with Android 14 x Realme UI 5 out of the box.

Realme Neo 7 Turbo Color Options and Memory Variants Teased Ahead of Launch,"Usama Rasool May 26, 2025

Realme’s flagship lineup is going to expand once again with the upcoming launch of the Realme Neo 7 Turbo. Set to debut in China on May 29, the device has been officially showcased in teasers, giving us the first look at its design. Realme has also confirmed the available colors and memory trims, building anticipation for the device before it’s released in the market.





The Neo 7 Turbo will come out in two ordinary colors: Gray and Black. By the way, these are not official marketing names but placeholders based on the phone’s appearance. The design and texture on the back are also unique. The mechanical engravings seem to follow the Neo 7 Turbo’s internal circuitry.

The design seems catchy enough for its target demographic, which is the gamer community. The Realme Neo 7 series recently separated itself from the upper-end GT clan to carve its own niche in the performance flagship category. This Neo 7 Turbo is expected to be an affordable yet powerful gaming device.





There are at least four storage/RAM options unveiled by the company in the new teasers. The Realme's new Turbo model one is 12GB+256GB, and the most expensive option seems to be the 16GB+512GB trim. The two variants in-between have 12GB+512GB memory and 16GB+256GB RAM and storage combo.





Some of its teasers gave away the SoC details. The phone has a Dimensity 9400e engine at its core, which is an underpowered version of the original Dimensity 9400 SoC. The “e” variant of this chip scores 19% less than the original chip on the AnTuTu benchmark, although 2.15 million points are still decent enough to be awarded the flagship title.





The phone’s primary camera seems to be a 50 MP lens with two unspecified secondary sensors. There’s also NFC onboard with the logo engraved on the body right beside the camera housing. The phone even brings dart charging support, though the exact figure hasn’t come out yet.

Android 16 “Live Updates” Feature Gets an Early Demo on One UI 8,"Usama Rasool May 26, 2025

Google has officially unveiled Android 16 at the I/O 2025 event, highlighting several new features. It includes a “Live Updates” tool that displays real-time activities across the lock screen, notification shade, AOD, and the status bar. Android 16 is set to arrive on Samsung devices later this year, and the event gave us an early look at how it integrates Live Updates with One UI 8.0.





The developer keynote at Google I/O 2025 revealed a feature called Live Update and showed how it might look on a stock Android device. This feature will eventually land on Xiaomi, OnePlus, Samsung, and Vivo handsets. Google already gave an early peek at the Live updates on One UI 8, using the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

The image provided here should give you a rough idea of how the Live Updates appear on the phone’s Now Bar. It’s a photo of a Galaxy S25 Ultra, which has been upgraded to Android 16 x One UI 8, which shows the progress of an Uber Eats delivery at the bottom of the lock screen.





It’s a clever system to keep track of your live activities without unlocking the screen. This will be a feature bundled in the core Android system. We assume many other brands will give you a customized version of the Live Updates on their handsets with Android 16. App developers might be given an API to integrate this feature into their process as well.

The Uber Eats example given in the image shows you how the activity is tracked in five steps, from ordering the food to getting it delivered. There’s even an option to interact with the activity without opening the app. A user can call, message, or tip the rider.





Google says that only food delivery, navigation, and ride-hailing apps have been allowed to use the Live Updates feature on Android 16. More apps might be able to integrate this option in the future. Live updates are also expected to arrive on smartwatches next year.

CDPR releases 37 minutes of Cyberpunk 2077 Switch 2 video - so what have we learned?,"Developer CD Projekt RED has uploaded a generous batch of Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2077 footage week - 37 minutes of direct 4K capture to be exact - giving us an early glimpse at the state of its docked 30fps quality mode. Since it releases on 5th June as a Switch 2 launch title, we don't really have too long to wait to see the real thing in action, though given that this footage comes with no ""early build"" disclaimer or suchlike it appears CDPR is confident in what it's showing in this material - and for good reason. Poring over all the assets, we have plenty to work with for some preliminary comparisons and even frame-rate analysis. In short, the prospects for this Switch 2 rendition are encouraging overall.

In terms of content, CDPR is showing all manner of gameplay: driving, combat, major mission set pieces - you name it, it's included. Some clips even reveal, quite openly, the challenges Switch 2 faces in running such a complex open world game - notably for high speed car action. To its credit, frame-rate delivery at 30 frames per second is strong based on this footage overall, with drops into the 20-30fps range mainly being a problem while speeding through Night City's streets. Especially at points where multiple AI cars clog up its roads, it appears drops and traversal hitches are possible, something we're keen to re-test on its release. It's a positive showing overall, though: on-foot exploration around its markets, the bustling parade sequence teeming with NPCs, and even combat during the Phantom Liberty DLC all run at a perfect 30fps here.

In performance terms, this showing is perhaps best put in the context of what's currently possible on last-gen consoles, and also Series S. In re-testing the base PS4 version today for example, it's sobering to find that open world roaming there still plays out with hitching, geometry pop-in and drops to 20-30fps - certainly more than is evident in this Switch 2 footage. Going hands-on with the final build ourselves is a must for any final word on this, but early signs point to fewer glaring issues in traversal and battle.

1:35:32 Supporter Q4: Could Switch 2 become a dumping ground for last-gen games?

1:40:29 Supporter Q5: What are your hopes and concerns for Switch 2?

On the other hand, Xbox Series S' performance level - in its own 30fps quality mode - is a more aspirational target for Switch 2. We described this version as 'what last-gen should have been' in our original review, thanks to it boasting a broadly rock-solid 30fps experience, and it even went on to receive a 60fps mode post-release. A question mark hovers over the viability of Switch 2's own 40fps performance mode though, where we have no recent assets. More to come on this when we get the game ourselves.

In terms of comparisons, image quality is a plus point for Switch 2 when compared to the older PS4 release, and even Series S. Much of this boils down to Nvidia's DLSS upscaling technology being available to Switch 2's Tegra 239 processor. CDPR has already confirmed the use of DLSS to hit a 1080p target in docked play in this case (and a 720p target in handheld mode). However, the actual native pixel counts are typically lower than 1080p - with dynamic scaling taking us to 1280x720 at its nadir during the most extreme 20fps drop on record here while driving. More typically though, numbers like 792p, 810p and 864p crop up at less taxing points in the footage, which is a high enough base pixel count for DLSS to (usually) work its magic and reconstruct a 1080p frame.

For perspective, Series S' quality mode renders at a 1296p-1440p range using AMD's FSR 2 as its upscaler (as of a late 2022 patch 1.61, following an upgrade from TAA). Meanwhile, base PS4 continues to run at a 720p-900p range using CDPR's own in-house temporal AA solution. In both cases Switch 2 has an advantage in temporal stability, at least. Even though it runs at a lower pixel count than Series S, DLSS more adeptly cleans up the game's visual noise in certain scenarios compared to FSR 2. Shimmer is minimised across the dampened floors of the market area, while during static moments, fences and character detail up-close resolve with added sharpness via Switch 2's upscaler.

On the downside, for all its benefits, DLSS does not always hide its lower base pixel input. Driving at speed reveals blocking artefacts on Switch 2, while a later Johnny Silverhand dialogue sequence shows similar break-up around two background NPCs playing basketball. There are some limits on show, then, but it's a respectably competitive result next to Series S all things considered. In fact, it's similar to what we found with Street Fighter 6 comparisons between these two consoles, where Switch 2 pushes a sharper, less visibly noisy frame via DLSS - and despite Capcom's fightert running at a lower native res in that case.

Focusing on visual quality, it's a surprise to find Switch 2 is on par with both PS4 and Series S in a great many of its core settings. Paired side-by-side with each, there is scarce evidence of any differences in recreated shots: texture quality is a match, SSR is enabled across the floors, and motion blur is engaged too. There is a difference in ambient occlusion (resulting in thicker pockets of object shading on Switch 2) that needs further investigation - and it's clear that Switch 2 also loses the lens flare effect of the Series S release. That aside, the variance in time of day and NPC placement account for a majority of the differences in the open city - whereas in confined interiors that are perfectly matched, the main difference is again DLSS' impact on image quality.

It's a positive peak at CDPR's optimisation efforts so far and it appears to be an improvement on the build I played at Nintendo's Switch 2 event in London last month. We're just ten days away from what's undeniably one of the most technically challenging third party games on Switch 2, and it's certainly a big one for coverage plans at Digital Foundry. In fact as I type this, there's an ongoing effort to bank as much Cyberpunk 2077 footage on other platforms for comparison. Roll on June 5th!",https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-cd-projekt-red-drops-37-minutes-of-cyberpunk-2077-video-so-what-have-we-learned,Technology
‘Desktop Survivors 98’ Can Turn Your PC Into A Retro Battleground,"Ever thought about playing Windows 98 as a retro battleground game? Well, with “Desktop Survivors 98,” you can.







To those of you who do not know, Desktop Survivors 98 is an action-packed game that transforms your actual Windows desktop into a chaotic battlefield. In a roguelike genre fashion, it draws from both modern gameplay mechanics and nostalgic aesthetics.

Indie developer Brandon Hesslau has released the game on Steam and has since turned quite a few heads due to its unconventional approach to bullet-hell mayhem. The game which dropped on May 20 has since garnered a near-perfect 9/10 review on Steam.

Desktop Survivors 98: The Lore

Inspired by titles like Vampire Survivors, Desktop Survivors 98 lets players control a character represented by their cursor. The little guy is seen battling endless waves of enemies that spawn directly on the desktop interface. Power-ups, weapons, and enemies all appear over existing windows and icons, blending gaming with day-to-day computer use in real time.







What sets the game apart is its major dedication to the Windows 98 era. The game delivers a strong taste of nostalgia and keeps modern roguelike characteristics. Players must avoid opponents dressed as Clippy’s long-lost relative, Swordy, and use patience cards and the MS Paint bucket. The cursor-driven, fast-paced gameplay involves the smart use of unique upgrades scattered throughout the screen, as well as the ability to react rapidly.

Users’ Feedback on Desktop Survivors 98 So Far

Despite its novelty, some players have raised concerns, including visibility issues on dark backgrounds and enemies spawning too close to the cursor. However, community feedback has largely been positive, praising the game’s creativity, humor, and unique desktop integration.

A Boost to the Retro Gaming Fandom

Desktop Survivors 98 is designed for both quick five-minute bursts and longer sessions, with accessibility features like an instant toggle on/off system, making it a flexible addition to any gamer’s library.

Whether you’re a fan of retro computing or looking for a new take on roguelike chaos, Desktop Survivors 98 offers an experience that’s equal parts charming and chaotic.

The game, now live on Steam, continues to gain traction among indie game fans and retro enthusiasts alike despite user concerns over trivial aspects.",https://www.techjuice.pk/desktop-survivors-98-can-turn-your-pc-into-a-retro-battleground/,Technology
Samsung to Replace Silicon with Glass in AI Chip Packaging by 2028,"Samsung Electronics is preparing to replace traditional silicon interposers with glass substrates in chip packaging by 2028.







This move, recently confirmed through the company’s official roadmap, signals a turning point in AI chip innovation and manufacturing efficiency.

The switch to glass interposers offers multiple advantages over current silicon-based options, especially for 2.5D chip packaging used in AI semiconductors. Interposers play a key role by connecting GPUs with high-bandwidth memory (HBM), ensuring fast data communication.

While effective, silicon interposers are costly and less stable at scale. Glass, on the other hand, provides “more precision for ultra-fine circuits” and better dimensional stability, all at a lower cost—a critical factor as AI adoption soars.







According to industry insiders,

“Samsung has established a plan to transition from silicon interposers to glass interposers in 2028 to meet customer demands.”

Samsung’s Unique Approach

Samsung’s strategy stands out from the rest of the industry. While competitors like AMD are also exploring glass interposers, Samsung is working on sub-100x100mm glass units. It is a smaller format compared to the industry’s 510x515mm glass panels. This allows faster prototyping, helping Samsung accelerate its market entry despite a slight trade-off in manufacturing efficiency.

Moreover, Samsung plans to use its Cheonan campus PLP (Panel-Level Packaging) line, which uses square panels instead of round wafers. This method could enable Samsung to optimize its packaging process and reduce production time.

All-in-One AI Manufacturing Ecosystem

This shift complements Samsung’s broader AI Integrated Solution strategy, which aims to consolidate foundry services, HBM memory, and advanced packaging within a single streamlined process. This could give the tech giant a powerful edge in the AI race by offering end-to-end chip solutions.

With the AI chip market growing rapidly, this strategic change may not only improve Samsung’s internal chip performance but also attract external clients, potentially boosting its semiconductor revenue. The adoption of glass substrates is expected to evolve gradually, allowing Samsung to refine the process and widen its lead over time.",https://www.techjuice.pk/samsung-to-replace-silicon-with-glass-in-ai-chip-packaging-by-2028/,Technology

Nintendo to hold another Direct around Switch 2 launch: report,"Nintendo is reportedly planning to hold a Direct live stream around the launch of the Switch 2 gaming console on June 5.

Journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe, who has previously shared credible details about Nintendo’s plans, made the claim during a live stream with a foreign media outlet.

According to Lippe, the company is likely to hold another Direct around the launch of the Switch 2 gaming console on June 5.

The Kyoto-based company has held a Nintendo Direct every year since the format was started in 2012.

The events are generally aimed at new announcements across multiple titles, while there have been Directs, which focused on single titles such as Smash Bros. Ultimate or Pokémon.

There have not been any official statements from the company on the claim about its rumoured Direct.

Nintendo has, however, held multiple Directs this year, the first of which announced details on the Switch 2 gaming console.

The second live stream was dedicated to Mario Kart World, while the third focused on the original Switch.

Reportedly, Nintendo will release first-party titles at initial launch on June 5, followed by the second phase, which will allow the release of titles from third-party publishers.

The third and final phase will cover the Christmas period, which would allow both Nintendo and third-party publishers to release some major titles.",https://arynews.tv/nintendo-to-hold-another-direct-around-switch-2-launch/,Technology
"Over 180m users’ passwords, login credentials stolen in massive data breach, says national cyber security body","The National Cyber Emergency Response Team (PKCERT) on Monday issued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan have been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures.

According to the advisory, seen by Dawn.com, PKCERT identified the global breach involving a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing more than 184 million unique account credentials.

“The breach exposed usernames, passwords, emails and associated URLs tied to services from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Instagram [and] Snapchat, as well as government portals, banking institutions, and healthcare platforms worldwide,” the advisory read.

“The leaked database is believed to have been compiled using infostealer malware — malicious software that extracts sensitive information from compromised systems,” it added. “This data was stored in plain text and left completely unprotected, with no encryption or password safeguarding.”

PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.

It outlined the potential impacts of the data breach, warning that the stolen credentials could be used for account takeovers, identity theft and unauthorised access to government portals or other sensitive sites, among other potential threats.

The advisory highlighted that the publicly hosted database was storing credentials stolen from “infected endpoints” without any form of authentication or protection and “included sensitive login information for major platforms, enterprises, government agencies, and financial institutions”.

“Attackers may exploit this breach through credential stuffing across services with reused passwords; phishing attacks using associated emails and historical data; targeted social engineering leveraging exposed personal content; unauthorised access to business and government accounts; and malware deployment using existing email and password combinations,” the advisory warned.

PKCERT advised users to change their passwords and enable multi-factor authentication on all of their online services, particularly on financial and administrative accounts.

“Use unique, complex passwords for every online service, avoid storing passwords in emails or unprotected files [and] consider a password manager to securely handle account credentials,” the advisory recommended.

The advisory also recommended that people change their passwords annually and use a credible online service to find out about potential breaches.

“Timely action is essential to limit the impact of this massive credential breach and prevent subsequent compromise of systems and identities,” it wrote, urging people to change compromised credentials, enforce multi-factor authentication and educate users on the risks of data breaches.

In March 2024, a Joint Investiga­tion Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), told the Interior Ministry that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million citizens had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.

Sources told Dawn.com that the JIT, headed by a senior officer of the Federal Investigation Agency and comprising representatives from various intelligence agencies, had completed its probe and subsequently submitted a report to the ministry.

The JIT found that Nadra offices in Karachi, Multan and Peshawar were allegedly involved in the data leak and recommended action against various officials.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913465/over-180m-users-passwords-login-credentials-stolen-in-massive-data-breach-says-national-cyber-security-body,Technology
Top 5 Batman Games You Absolutely Cannot Miss Out On,"Batman has been a central figure in video games for decades, with titles spanning various genres and platforms.







From side-scrolling beat ’em ups to expansive open-world adventures, the Dark Knight’s gaming history is rich and varied. Here are four standout games that have left a significant mark on the gaming world:

4. Batman (Arcade, 2013)

This arcade-exclusive title offers a unique experience, allowing players to drive the Batmobile through Gotham’s streets. With multiple missions and a variety of Batmobiles to choose from, it provides an exhilarating ride for fans of the Caped Crusader.

3. Batman: Arkham City (2011)

Instagram adds handy new DM features in latest update,"A new Instagram update has rolled out that brings more features to its Direct Messages (DMs), aiming to make chats more flexible and useful.

This Instagram update reflects the way people now use the app, with more photos and videos being shared privately rather than publicly.

Instagram chief Adam Mosseri recently said that DM sharing is now far more common than posting to the feed or Stories. Calling it a “paradigm shift,” Mosseri explained that this change in user behaviour is why the company is focusing more on messaging features.

One of the key changes in this update is the ability to transcribe voice messages.

When users receive a voice clip, they will see a “View transcription” button, which shows the text of the message either before, during, or after listening.

This feature makes it easier to understand voice messages when you’re in a place where listening isn’t possible.

Another feature introduced with this Instagram update is the extension of voice message length. Until now, voice clips in DMs could only be one minute long, but they can now be up to five minutes.

Read More: Meta faces existential threat at trial over Instagram, WhatsApp

This gives users more time to say what they want, and those receiving the message can still use the new transcription tool.

Instagram had been testing the longer voice message option with some users before making it available to everyone. Now, it is part of the broader Instagram update that improves how people communicate in the app.

Finally, the Instagram update also includes a “Follow All” button in group chats.

This Instagram update allows users to follow everyone in the group quickly, without having to tap on each profile one by one. It could be useful in large group chats where not all members are already connected.

This Instagram update shows the platform’s growing focus on DMs and adapting to how users now prefer to share and chat.",https://arynews.tv/instagram-update-adds-voice-message-transcription-new-features/,Technology
Android 16 Introduces Long-Awaited Fingerprint Renaming Feature,"Android users often found themselves limited when it came to managing saved fingerprints, especially when trying to identify or manage multiple ones. That’s about to change. With the upcoming Android 16 update, Google is making a subtle but much-needed improvement to fingerprint management.







With the arrival of Android 16 QPR1 beta, users will finally be able to rename fingerprints after they’ve been set up. This long-requested feature makes it far easier to know which fingerprint belongs to whom, especially for those sharing their device or using multiple fingers.

The addition was first noticed in Google’s first preview of the Android 16 QPR1 beta. The fingerprint renaming option is now part of the Security settings, giving users clearer control over their enrolled fingerprints.

From Add/Delete to Full Management

Until now, Android users have had limited control over fingerprint settings. You could either add a new fingerprint or delete an existing one, but you couldn’t tell which was which unless you remembered the order. This often led to confusion and a lack of confidence in fingerprint-based privacy.







Now, users can tap to view all enrolled fingerprints, rename them, and ensure each one is easily identifiable. This change was first reported by Android Authority, highlighting its practical value.

Though minor at first glance, this update is an essential quality-of-life improvement. It is one that other manufacturers like Samsung have had for years in One UI. With this rollout, Android is closing the gap in user-friendly fingerprint personalization.

Android 16 will bring several other enhancements, especially for Pixel phone users, beyond the fingerprint features. While Google hasn’t fully detailed the extent of the changes, early previews suggest the company is focusing heavily on both usability and privacy.

What may seem like a small tweak is actually a major stride toward better device personalization and security management. With Android 16, users won’t just unlock their phones, they’ll unlock more control over how they do it.",https://www.techjuice.pk/android-16-introduces-long-awaited-fingerprint-renaming-feature/,Technology
AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT vs. Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070,"When AMD launched the Radeon RX 9070 XT, it was positioned as a direct rival to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070. But in the world of graphics cards, real-world pricing often tells a different story than marketing intentions. And when we first put the 9070 XT to a head to head test in 55 games, it wasn't against the 5070 – it was up against the more powerful 5070 Ti.

Predictably, some were upset with that decision, but there was a reason: at the time, AMD's card was priced closer to the Ti variant, and we were curious how it would fare against the tougher competition. The Radeon came in about 5% slower in performance, but roughly 17% cheaper based on what people were actually paying – not the manufacturer's suggested price.

Now, it's time for the head-to-head matchup that some of you were waiting for: 9070 XT vs. RTX 5070.

Since our last round of testing – 55 games deep at 1440p and 4K – both AMD and Nvidia have rolled out driver updates that fine-tuned performance across several titles.

Meanwhile, GPU prices have shifted significantly. The RTX 5070 is settling closer to its MSRP, with cards available for around $610, while the 5070 Ti is now hovering at $825. Surprisingly, the Radeon 9070 XT has gone in the opposite direction – currently selling for about $860 in the US, a full 41% more than the RTX 5070 and even pricier than the faster 5070 Ti.

That's been a surprising turn, especially considering it also represents a 4% premium over the 5070 Ti, despite being 5% slower on average and offering a weaker feature set.

It's a similar story around the globe, with price gaps varying by region but consistently putting the 9070 XT at a premium over the 5070. In Germany, the Radeon 9070 XT costs 745 euros, making it 11% cheaper than the 5070 Ti but still 26% more expensive than the 5070.

That's an improvement compared to what we see in the US, but ideally, the 9070 XT should be at least 20% cheaper than the 5070 Ti and only about 10% more expensive than the 5070.

In Canada, the 9070 XT is priced at $1,100, which is 12% cheaper than the 5070 Ti, but also 34% more than the RTX 5070. Meanwhile, in Australia, both the 5070 and 5070 Ti are available at local MSRP (RRP). At $1,300 AUD, the 9070 XT costs 14% less than the 5070 Ti and 18% more than the 5070.

In short, that means the 9070 XT costs 41% more than the 5070 in the US, 34% more in Canada, 26% more in Germany, and 18% more in Australia.

So, with the latest drivers in play, how much faster is the 9070 XT than the RTX 5070?

We're about to find out with a massive 57-game benchmark covering 1440p and 4K resolutions. We won't walk through every game individually – instead, we'll dive into the key highlights and deliver a comprehensive performance breakdown. Let's get started.

Benchmarks

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

Since our previous testing, the performance of the 9070 XT has improved by 14% at 1440p and 9% at 4K in Black Ops 6, giving the Radeon GPU a significant performance advantage over not just the RTX 5070, but also the 5070 Ti. We're seeing a 68% increase at 1440p and 70% at 4K compared to the 5070.

Hunt: Showdown 1896

Unfortunately, performance has only improved by a few frames in Hunt: Showdown 1896, and as a result, the 9070 XT is much slower than the RTX 5070 – trailing by 12% at 1440p and 18% at 4K. We're testing using the maximum in-game quality settings at native resolution.

Rocket League

The latest GeForce driver has improved performance in Rocket League. The 5070 Ti is now 12% faster than the 9070 XT, with similar results at 4K. Compared to the standard 5070, the 9070 XT is 14% faster at 1440p and 31% faster at 4K.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

The updated GeForce driver has resolved performance issues previously observed in Space Marine 2, and Radeon performance has also improved. As a result, the 9070 XT is 7% faster than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 10% faster at 4K.

Assetto Corsa Competizione

Performance has improved for the 9070 XT in Assetto Corsa Competizione with the new driver. Even so, the 5070 Ti remains much faster. The 9070 XT only manages to match the 5070 at 4K while ending up 9% slower at 1440p.

The Last of Us Part I

In The Last of Us Part I, the 9070 XT was 24% faster than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 37% faster at 4K – a strong result for AMD, as the 9070 XT also outpaced the Ti model.

Starfield

The 9070 XT is particularly strong in Starfield, outperforming the 5070 Ti at both tested resolutions. It's 31% faster than the 5070 at 1440p and 36% faster at 4K, making this an easy win for AMD.

Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced

For Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced, please note we're using the maximum RT quality preset with scaling disabled, meaning all results reflect native resolution. If you enable the preset without adjusting settings, resolution scaling will be turned on by default, increasing FPS.

Here, the 9070 XT doesn't perform particularly well relative to the GeForce GPUs. It was 5% slower than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and only 2% faster at 4K.

Marvel Rivals

In Marvel Rivals, the 9070 XT sits between the 5070 and 5070 Ti, offering 14% better performance than the 5070 at both 1440p and 4K. It's a solid showing compared to the 5070, though still behind the Ti variant.

Horizon Forbidden West

The 9070 XT delivers excellent results in Horizon Forbidden West, comfortably beating the RTX 5070 Ti. It's 34% faster than the 5070 at 1440p and 40% faster at 4K, averaging 80 FPS.

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered

Oblivion Remastered also runs well on the 9070 XT, hitting 69 FPS at 1440p and beating the RTX 5070 by 30%. At 4K, it averaged 44 FPS, giving it a 38% lead.

Cyberpunk 2077

For Cyberpunk 2077, we're using the high preset with upscaling disabled, so results reflect native resolution performance. The 9070 XT delivered 25% higher performance than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 27% higher at 4K.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the newest titles in this test. Here, the 9070 XT roughly matches the 5070 Ti, coming in 24% faster than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 21% faster at 4K.

Monster Hunter Wilds

The 9070 XT performs well in Monster Hunter Wilds, offering 25% better performance than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 20% better at 4K – clearly positioning it a tier above the similarly priced RTX 5070.

57 Game Performance Summary

1440p Average

At 1440p across the 57 games tested, the 9070 XT was, on average, 17% faster than the RTX 5070. That would be impressive if both cards were available at MSRP, considering the Radeon GPU should cost just 9% more.

However, in Australia it costs 18% more, and pricing in other major regions is typically 30 – 40% higher, meaning the 9070 XT currently represents poor value.

4K Average

The 4K results are only slightly more favorable. The 9070 XT was 21% faster on average compared to the RTX 5070. Again, in Australia it costs 18% more, and in regions such as Canada, Germany, and the US, it is priced significantly higher than the RTX 5070.

Cost Per Frame (versus RTX 5070)

Let's take a look at how the 9070 XT compares to the RTX 5070 in terms of cost per frame across four regions. In Australia, the 9070 XT ends up being slightly worse value than the RTX 5070 – just by a few percent – so in practical terms, they're nearly identical in value.

The 9070 XT does offer more VRAM, while the 5070 features DLSS 4, which has an edge over FSR 4, primarily due to broader adoption.

In Germany, the 9070 XT is 9% worse in value, and in Canada and the US, it's a complete blowout, with the Radeon GPU offering 16 – 22% worse value. In those regions, it's essentially a non-starter.

Cost Per Frame (versus RTX 5070 Ti)

When compared with the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the Radeon 9070 XT becomes even less compelling. Current pricing shows the 9070 XT offering just 9% better cost-per-frame value in Australia, 6% in Germany, 7% in Canada, and remarkably, it's actually 10% worse in the US.

Even in regions where the 9070 XT technically offers better value than the 5070 Ti, the margin is in the single digits – far short of the 20% improvement that would be needed to make it a clearly better option.

Are GeForce owners really going to switch to Radeon for less than a 10% savings? We already know the answer to that. If pricing and availability continue in this direction, Radeon sales are going to slow down fast.

Who Wins?

So there you have it. Across a wide range of games, the 9070 XT is around 20% faster than the RTX 5070, putting it in a higher performance tier. That would be great news for AMD if both GPUs were available at MSRP.

In that case, the Radeon 9070 XT would cost about 10% more while offering 20% more performance. You could also reasonably overlook the GeForce GPU's advantages – such as better upscaling support and superior ray tracing performance – mainly because the latter is hindered by the RTX 5070's limited 12GB of VRAM, which we expect to become a significant limitation in the coming years.

However, as we've just seen, AMD has not been able to maintain its MSRP – something we anticipated in our day-one review. At the time, we reported that AMD was heavily subsidizing the initial batches of product to meet the advertised MSRP, while board partners told us that the actual MSRP for many models was much higher. Here's what we said in that review:

... we have some concerns about how ""real"" the $600 MSRP actually is. After some investigation, it appears that AMD is providing retailers with a $50 rebate to achieve the $600 pricing. This strongly suggests the intended MSRP was actually $650, and AMD is temporarily subsidizing models to hit the lower price point. For example, XFX confirmed that the 9070 XT Mercury – a model featured in this review – will not cost $650. In fact, it won't even cost $700. Instead, the official MSRP is $770, and due to tariffs, its on-shelf price is expected to be $850 – which would be tragic if true. From what we've gathered, it seems AMD is starting to play Nvidia's pricing game. This means that while some 9070 XT models may be available at $600 initially, most will likely be priced higher, and restocks at that price may be limited or infrequent. A lot will depend on how sales perform.

At the time, we predicted that tariffs would push the real price to around $850, based on multiple pre-release sources. Today – two months after launch – the cheapest 9070 XT is $860, which aligns closely with what we were told.

Unfortunately for AMD, this makes things difficult, as Nvidia is now doing better on the pricing front. As we've shown, the RTX 5070 currently offers significantly better value in the US, and even the Ti variant delivers a better cost per frame.

Of course, this depends on the region. In Australia, for example, the RTX 5070 and 9070 XT offer similar value in terms of cost per frame. Given that, we would recommend the 9070 XT locally, primarily because it comes with 16GB of VRAM – which we consider the minimum for any GPU priced at or above $400. That said, the RX 9070 (non-XT), which is nearly 20% cheaper, is the better choice right now in Australia.

However, this doesn't apply to the other regions we analyzed. Remarkably, GeForce GPUs currently offer better value in Germany, Canada, and the US. In Canada, the standard RTX 5070 delivers a 20% better cost per frame than the Ti model, making it a viable option.

Still, we're hesitant to recommend an $820 GPU with just 12GB of VRAM – especially for those planning to play modern titles at maximum settings, using features like ray tracing and frame generation.

So, after a very promising launch, supported by strong initial availability and competitive pricing thanks to months of subsidized inventory, the 9070 series has become a disappointing release, at least based on current pricing. That said, it hasn't yet impacted sales, according to the data we've been able to obtain.

Thanks to the initial hype, the Radeon 9070 XT continues to sell well, locally outperforming the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of units sold. The real issue for AMD is supply, which has kept pricing high. But as it stands today, for the majority of buyers, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the better purchase, and it's the card we recommend over the 9070 XT right now.

Anker Nebula X1 Home Projector Review: Gorgeous Anywhere,"The world’s first home projector was the Pathé KOK Home Cinematograph. Launched in 1912, it used 28-millimeter film and a hand crank. Thanks to this kernel of an idea, I've just watched a film on the new Anker Nebula X1, in my garden, projected in 4K Ultra High Definition, onto a 120-inch screen, with a genuinely thrilling 4.1.2 surround-sound speaker system.

At home, I've never had the space, budget or patience to install a full-scale home cinema. But I do love the big screen, and in the pursuit of something close to a compromise I have tested dozens of superb portable projectors. As mobile technology has improved, these tiny Android-toting boxes of fun have made it possible for anyone to stream content onto a blank wall, screen, or the side of a tent. But none have come closer to looking and sounding like a proper home cinema than the Anker Nebula X1.

Photograph: Chris Haslam

Anyone familiar with Anker's range of portable projectors will recognize the X1. It looks like the big brother of the excellent Cosmos Laser 4K ($2000). Externally there are similarities for sure, but inside ""the world’s first cinema-grade outdoor entertainment system"" is a completely reengineered beast, with 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness, 5,000:1 contrast ratio, liquid cooling, a built-in micro gimbal, and AI powered setup, plus the possibility of adding two wireless satellite speakers to give it true 4.2.2 surround sound, and mics for karaoke.

But to get the best from it you'll need to spend big, and with fierce competition from brands including XGIMI, Hisense, and BenQ, is it worth your money? I think so.

Screen Time

The Nebula X1 can project up to a 200-inch image from between 13 to 22 feet thanks to its optical zoom. The built-in gimbal (an industry first) tilts up to 25 degrees to help it align with your chosen surface, while keystone correction, focus (there's a 1.67x optical zoom), and ambient light are all tweaked automatically. This is all done via a single button on the remote control, making it one of the easiest projectors I've set up.

There's also AI Spatial Recall, which is a fancy way to describe the fact that the projector can remember where it is and how big you like the screen. This setting works well but isn't always 100 percent—it needs to be placed pretty close to the original position—but you can tweak screen angle and focus manually too.

I've not got the space for a 200-inch display, but I did witness it during a product preview in a cinema screening room. Yes, lighting and screen conditions were optimal, but I was still impressed by the detail and brightness created by the combination of 3,500 ANSI Lumen brightness, 4K (3840 × 2160) resolution and a cinema-grade 14-element all-glass lens.",https://www.wired.com/review/anker-nebula-x1-home-projector/,Technology
Meta Tests 3D Instagram Photos on Quest Headsets Using AI,"Meta is testing a new feature that transforms standard Instagram photos into immersive 3D images on its Quest virtual reality (VR) headsets. This innovation utilizes AI-driven display synthesis algorithms to convert 2D images into 3D visuals without the need for specialized cameras, enhancing the user experience on the platform.







The feature is part of the latest v77 update to Meta’s Horizon OS and is currently available to a select group of users. By leveraging AI view synthesis, the system adds depth to flat images, allowing users to experience a more lifelike representation of their Instagram feed in VR. Meta aims to collect feedback during this trial phase to refine the technology before a broader rollout.

Apart from the 3D picture capability, the v77 upgrade brings some more improvements.

‘Gundam Seed Battle Destiny Remastered’ Switch Review: A Clear Upgrade,"This remaster is a definite step up over the Vita original. Bandai Namco

Way back in 2012, Gundam Seed Battle Destiny was released on the PlayStation Vita. It was a solid little game, and this Remastered version stays true to its heritage.

The Gundam Battle games were originally developed for the PlayStation Portable by Artdink, starting with Gundam Battle Tactics in 2005.

It was a good little mecha action game too, where you took down enemy mobile suits with a tethered orbit lock-on setup and various long and close-range weapons.

In the following years, Artdink improved on this setup with a multitude of follow-up games until they had to make the jump to the Vita.

Unlike the previous PlayStation Portable releases, a new Vita game meant all the visual assets needed to be rebuilt from the ground up.

With this additional expense, Artdink also took the time to re-evaluate the controls and took advantage of the Vita’s dual analogue setup.

The result was a decent entry in the Gundam Battle series, and I game I enjoyed playing through back when I reviewed it in 2012.

Even on Switch, the game looks and runs great. Bandai Namco

So, how does this new Remastered version stack up?

Well, first off, it has more comprehensive controller options. I normally play with inverted vertical controls, and in the original Vita version, there was no way to change that. However, in this new Remastered version, there is.

The frame rate, at least on the Switch version, is also more stable, and being able to play with a proper pad does make the whole experience more comfortable. On the Vita version, I’d end up with the patented claw rictus in one hand, or both, after an extended session. Here, I’ve had no issues at all.

As for the game itself, like almost all Gundam Battle games, you always start off with an underpowered grunt unit. Playing multiple missions earns you tuning points to make the mobile suit perform more fluidly.

This is a staple of these games, and it does mean you have to play a fair bit before the game gets into its groove.

This used to be more of an issue because each mobile suit would accrue its own upgrade points through playing the game. These points also weren’t often transferable, either, and it resulted in you replaying previous missions to gain enough points to actually make your mobile suit decent.

As the Gundam Battle games evolved, you got GP points. These were earned alongside the mobile suits’ own tuning points and could be spent on whatever mobile suit you wanted.

The back-end tuning setup is key for your progression through the game. Bandai Namco

This was very handy because it meant that once you unlocked a nice beefy mobile suit later on in any given game, you already had some currency that could be used to upgrade your ride of choice from the moment you got it.

To feed into this, in addition to the Story missions, you also had EX Missions in this game. These were redone versions of the Story missions, but you got big GP rewards after each one.

So, apart from the visual upgrade, there is an improvement over the controls and general upgrade progression compared to the Vita version.

Personally, I also think the Gundam Battle games play far better than the Gundam Breaker games, but in this instance, if you’re not a fan of Gundam Seed, then your enjoyment of the game will likely be diminished.

Cuteness aside, the variety of series and mobile suits available in SD Gundam Battle Alliance made for a more complete and accessible game, in my opinion, which is also part of the Gundam Battle pantheon.

However, for a classic take on the original Gundam Battle setup, Gundam Seed Battle Destiny Remastered is arguably one of the best entries thus far and a marked improvement over the Vita original.

Overall, Gundam Seed Battle Destiny Remastered is not only a solid visual upgrade to the Vita original but also has some much-needed functional improvements, both in terms of the controls and the backend progression flow. The only real downside is if you’re not a fan of Gundam Seed, as otherwise, this is a very nicely made mecha action game. Now, if only Bandai Namco would remaster Gundam Battle Universe.

Apple's AirPods 4 with ANC drop to $149 for Memorial Day,"Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .

The best budget AirPods just became an even better deal.

Apple's AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation (ANC) just became an even more enticing proposition for those who have been on the fence about picking up a pair. They have dropped to $149 , which is $30 off the regular price. That's only about $10 more than the record low and the lowest price we've seen for the AirPods 4 with ANC so far this year.

If ANC isn't such a big deal for you (perhaps, like me, you tend to only wear one earbud at a time), you can snap up a set of AirPods 4 without ANC instead. Those will currently run you $119 , a discount of $10.

We gave the AirPods 4 with ANC a score of 86 in our review . Apple improved the audio quality compared with the previous version, and the earbuds have a better fit than the AirPods 3. We felt that the ANC was pretty effective too. However, the lack of onboard volume controls remains a disappointment.

The AirPods 4 use the same H2 chip as the AirPods Pro 2, meaning they share some features with the higher-end model. They support Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, Personalized Volume and Adaptive EQ. The ANC-enabled model also has Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and Transparency mode. In addition, the charging case that comes with the ANC version has Qi-compatible wireless charging, as well as a built-in speaker for Find My. However, the AirPods Pro 2's advanced hearing health features aren't present here.

A team of physicists has embarked on a journey where few others have gone: into the glue that binds atomic nuclei. The resultant measurement, which was extracted from experimental data taken at the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, is the first of its kind and will help physicists image particles called gluons.

The paper revealing the results is published and featured as an editor's suggestion in Physical Review Letters.

Gluons mediate the strong force that ""glues"" together quarks, another type of subatomic particle, to form the protons and neutrons situated at the center of atoms of ordinary matter. While previous measurements have allowed researchers to learn about the distribution of gluons in solitary protons or neutrons, they know less about how gluons behave inside protons or neutrons bound in nuclei.

""This result represents a big step forward in learning about where that gluon field is located in a proton,"" said Axel Schmidt, an assistant professor of physics at George Washington University and a principal investigator of this work. ""We see evidence that it might be changing when a proton or neutron is inside a nucleus.""

A charming guidepost particle

For more than four decades, the physics community has known that quarks, the building blocks of our visible universe, move slower when they make up a proton or neutron that's inside an atomic nucleus compared to a solitary proton or neutron. But physicists haven't been able to figure out why this phenomenon, known as the EMC effect, occurs.

To learn more about it, and the strong force in general, physicists need to probe gluons the way they probed quarks. However, measuring the distribution of gluons, which are neutral, is more challenging than measuring the distribution of electrically charged quarks.

""Studying these neutral particles that only interact by the strong force is much more difficult,"" said Lucas Ehinger, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who worked on the analysis that led to this measurement. ""We know a whole lot less about them and their dynamics in nuclei, including whether there's any kind of potential EMC effect with them.""

This work takes a step toward changing this. And it does so by measuring a different particle altogether: J/ψ (or J/psi).

The experiment was carried out at Jefferson Lab's Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, a DOE user facility that supports the research of more than 1,650 nuclear physicists worldwide. CEBAF's electron beams can be used to also produce beams of high-energy photons for experiments that explore atomic nuclei.

Shooting a beam of photons at protons and neutrons can produce J/ψ particles, which each promptly decays into an electron and positron. Detecting this pair shows how many J/ψ were produced during an experiment. J/ψ is made of charm quarks. Because charm quarks, one of the six flavors of quarks, are not part of the proton or neutron, physicists know J/ψ is born from the interaction between the photon and gluon, which can produce particles containing any flavor of quark.

The production of J/ψ is a well-known tool for studying gluon distributions. Previous experiments at Jefferson Lab used a photon beam to measure J/ψ production of a solitary proton in the GlueX detector. To produce J/ψ, which is a heavy particle, the energy of the photon beam had to be very high—at least 8.2 GeV.

In this work, the experimental team also used a photon beam to produce J/ψ. However, they were able to do so using photons below the 8.2 GeV energy threshold and measure the results in the GlueX detector.

This was possible because they were using different nuclei as targets: deuterium, helium and carbon. Unlike a solitary proton or neutron target, the protons and neutrons inside these nuclei are moving around. Their kinetic energy combines with the energy of the incoming below-threshold photon, and, together, they offer enough energy to create J/ψ.

As a result, the team was the first to measure J/ψ photoproduction below the photon energy threshold required for a stationary proton. Because this measurement was taken off nuclei, it images the glue holding together protons and neutrons bound inside the nucleus.

""We are in this frontier of nuclear glue. Essentially, nothing is known, so everything you measure is informative,"" said Or Hen, professor of physics at MIT and a principal investigator of this work. ""It's super exciting and super difficult at the same time.""

Charting a map for future measurements

One reason this pathfinder measurement was difficult is because there weren't previous measurements to guide it. Embarking on the analysis, the team wasn't even sure it was possible. The experiment that collected this data wasn't originally supposed to measure subthreshold J/ψ production; it was more of a hopeful add-on.

Thankfully, the researchers had Jackson Pybus on their team. Pybus led the bulk of the analysis while he was a graduate student at MIT. He called upon his training during a summer abroad in Germany. There, he had worked with a theoretician to learn about light-front dynamics.

This approach generally applies to quantum field theories, which describe relativistic particle behavior (particles moving close to the speed of light). In this research, it is most useful in describing particle systems like nuclei. Applying tricks from this theoretical method allowed Pybus and the team to extract this measurement.

""This work is both unique in terms of what physics it teaches us, but also in terms of the techniques that a graduate student implemented to get at that physics,"" Hen said. ""None of us, except for Jackson, would have been able to do this work. He deserves a lot of credit.""

When the experimentalists compared their sub-threshold measurement to theoretical predictions, they saw that more J/ψ were produced than theory predicted. This disparity hints that the nuclear glue behaves differently than the glue in solitary protons or neutrons, but more data are needed to determine exactly how. Fortunately, these results will serve as a map to guide similar future measurements.

""Now that we know that we can do this measurement, we would really like to optimize a longer experiment to measure this in detail and quantitatively pin down some of these potentially exotic effects, where we really only have a first look right now,"" said Pybus, who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The data used in this work—made up of only dozens of J/ψ measurements– were collected during a relatively short six-week run in 2021. The team is proposing an experiment dedicated to studying the nuclear glue, again using CEBAF's photon beam with the GlueX apparatus.

""Imagine what we could do if we had 100 days of dedicated accelerator time to really study this reaction,"" Hen said. ""We are now doing the very hard work of mapping out the frontier of the strong nuclear force with the hope that one day—maybe not in our lifetime—humanity's improved knowledge will enable better technology and more sustainable power sources.""

These results could also steer gluon experiments at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), which plans to further investigate gluons.

""We would like to learn about this problem and have a good handle of what's going on and where to look prior to this machine turning on,"" Schmidt said.",https://phys.org/news/2025-05-kind-physicists-gluons-nuclei-atoms.html,Technology
Motor Protein Dynamics Guide Brain Disease Drug Targeting,"The cell cytoskeleton is modulated by motor proteins, known as dyneins, that generate force and movement on microtubules to control a wealth of biological processes, including motility, cell division, and intracellular transport.

Mutation of Lis1, a key dynein regulator, can lead to the rare mental developmental disorder lissencephaly, or “smooth brain,” where the brain’s surface lacks the normal folds and grooves, for which there is no cure.

In a new paper published in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology titled, “Multiple steps of dynein activation by Lis1 visualized by cryo-EM,” researchers from the Salk Institute and University of California, San Diego (UCSD), have catalogued new high resolution Lis1 and dynein protein dynamics to guide the design of neurological drugs. Using a yeast model, the team solved 16 new structural conformations of dynein-Lis1 by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to inform precise atomic locations for drug targeting.

“Our approach to imaging dynein and Lis1 is more comprehensive than any previous study on this protein,” said co-corresponding author Andres Leschziner, PhD, professor at UCSD. “By capturing movies rather than pictures, we confirmed 16 detailed, 3D shapes that dynein takes as it interacts with Lis1, several of which are entirely unique to our study.”

Dynein belongs to the ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) family of proteins and uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate force and movement. Dynein exists predominantly detached from the microtubule in the autoinhibited “Phi” or “locked” conformation in cells. Recent studies suggest that Lis1 has crucial roles in dynein activation (“unlocked” state) and complex assembly. Based on evidence that dynein mutants locked in a microtubule-unbound state bind to Lis1 with a stronger affinity than their microtubule-bound counterpart, Lis1 is suggested to regulate dynein before dynein interacts with microtubules. However, the precise structural mechanism of dynein activation remains unclear.

While previous studies have used cryo-EM and other imaging methods to construct images of dynein in its locked and unlocked states individually, the Salk and UCSD authors present a time-resolved capture that identifies a series of structures over time to create a movie of dynein movement. The movie documents the step-by-step transition toward dynein activation by identifying the sub-second changes in structure.

The dynein complex is composed of a dimer of two motor domains and two copies each of five accessory chains (an intermediate chain, a light intermediate chain, and three light chains). Its heavy chain includes a motor domain composed of six AAA+ modules. Each AAA module is composed of a large and small domain, with nucleotide binding taking place in a groove between them and the large domain of the adjacent AAA module.

The authors suggest that Lis1 relieves dynein autoinhibition by increasing its basal ATP hydrolysis rate to promote conformations compatible with complex assembly and motility. The data support a hypothesis in which Lis1 promotes dynein activation by facilitating a nucleotide exchange in AAA3, potentially priming dynein for complex assembly.

“The impressive tools we have today in the lab made it possible for us to create a movie of dynein and Lis1 interacting in real time. Having this detailed view of their stepwise partnership will help us find ways to restore their activity in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases,” said Agnieszka Kendrick, PhD, assistant professor at Salk and co-corresponding author of the study.

The new high-resolution, 3D structural insight into dynein and Lis1 could pave the way for treating their dysfunction in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies will explore how different mutations to Lis1 affect its interactions with dynein and contribute to lissencephaly and other rare genetic disorders.",https://www.genengnews.com/topics/drug-discovery/motor-protein-dynamics-guide-brain-disease-drug-targeting/,Technology
Intel Supports AI Workstations With New GPUs and AI Accelerators,"At Computex 2025, Intel unveiled a sweeping refresh of its AI-focused hardware portfolio, reinforcing its position in both the workstation and data center markets. With the introduction of the Arc Pro B-Series GPUs and the third-generation Gaudi AI accelerator, Intel is bringing professional-grade AI compute to a broader spectrum of developers, creators, and enterprise users.

Arc Pro B-Series: Targeted Acceleration for Edge AI Workflows

The newly launched Arc Pro B60 and B50 GPUs are based on Intel’s Xe2 architecture and feature integrated XMX cores, Intel’s AI-optimized vector and matrix processing units. These GPUs were purpose-built for AI inference and design workloads in architecture, engineering, and creative sectors.

Both GPUs support PCIe 5.0 x8 connectivity and containerized Linux AI deployment stacks.

The flagship Arc Pro B60 boasts 20 Xe cores, 160 XMX engines, and 24 GB of GDDR6 memory across a 192-bit bus, yielding 456 GB/s of memory bandwidth and 197 TOPS (INT8) performance. With a TDP range between 120 W and 200 W, the B60 supports multi-GPU scalability and is certified across major ISV platforms like SolidWorks, Maya, and Blender.

Meanwhile, the B50 offers a more power-efficient solution at 70 W, with 16 Xe cores and 128 XMX engines delivering 170 TOPS. It pairs 16 GB of GDDR6 memory on a 128-bit bus (224 GB/s bandwidth), making it useful for lightweight AI tasks such as image upscaling or CAD acceleration in compact workstations.

Gaudi 3: A Heavyweight for Enterprise AI

At the high end, Intel introduced its Gaudi 3 accelerator, a dual-die processor designed to handle the demands of generative AI training and real-time inference at scale. Built on TSMC’s 5-nm node, Gaudi 3 (white paper linked) features 8 Matrix Multiplication Engines, 64 Tensor Processor Cores, and 128 GB of HBM2e memory with a bandwidth of 3.7 TB/s.

Its compute power reaches 1.8 PFLOPs for FP8 and BF16 workloads, with significant architectural improvements over Gaudi 2, such as doubled MMEs, 1.5× memory bandwidth, and a 40% boost in power efficiency. Intel claims that Gaudi 3 outperforms Nvidia’s H100 by up to 1.7× in LLM training and delivers 2.3× the inference efficiency in key workloads like Llama2-13 B.

These liquid-cooled systems are optimized for sustained performance in distributed AI clusters.

One of Gaudi 3’s key differentiators is its integrated networking. Each chip includes 24 RDMA-capable 200 Gbps Ethernet ports, supporting All2All scale-up topologies with 1.05 TB/s of bi-directional intra-node bandwidth and 150 GB/s inter-node scale-out. This open Ethernet-based fabric avoids vendor lock-in and simplifies scaling across up to 512 nodes without proprietary switches.

Intel AI Assistant Builder

Complementing the new silicon, Intel’s AI Assistant Builder has exited beta and is now available on GitHub. This open framework allows developers to build and run lightweight AI agents locally on Intel-powered systems. Combined with containerized Linux support and ISV-certified drivers, Intel’s software ecosystem is aligning closely with its hardware roadmap.

The Arc Pro series supports both consumer and pro driver stacks on Windows, while Gaudi 3 leverages the Habana Synapse AI SDK, which includes native support for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX. These tools are optimized for the architectural nuances of the MME and TPC engines and enable granular scheduling for mixed workloads across the compute pipeline.

While Nvidia still dominates the AI compute space, Intel’s new GPUs and AI accelerators provide a compelling alternative, especially for customers seeking open standards, flexible scaling, and efficient large model deployment. With commercial availability expected in the second half of 2025, Intel’s AI acceleration portfolio appears well-positioned to challenge the incumbents.

Apple’s Siri texts ‘Do you have cancer?’ to woman awaiting biopsy,"“Do you have cancer?” read the rather abrupt text that Carole Allen received from her friend Christine.

Allen was surprised, both by the tone of the message and its content. “I was utterly shocked, because it was just so intrusive,” she said. She was due to have a biopsy a few days later to see if she did have cancer, but had only informed a few friends and family of the procedure and Christine was not one of them.

“I was first quite angry, because it just was really a desperate thing to receive. It was so blunt,” she said.

Allen replied to Christine and discovered that her friend had not sent the text herself and also had no idea about the cancer test. The message had been automatically sent by Apple’s digital assistant Siri in an unfortunate collision of coincidence and tech failure.

Christine, who is not using her real name to protect the privacy of others, had been discussing the cancer diagnosis of a relative and also the medical treatment of another friend called Carole. She was sat at the dinner table with her husband wearing an Apple Watch. Her iPhone was on another table on the other side of the room.

Christine said: “I was eating my dinner. So I had my hands full with my knife and fork. And the next thing my watch buzzed. And I looked at it and it had actually texted Carole ‘Do you have cancer?’ And I said to his husband ‘Oh my God.’ And he’s like ‘What? Oh my God’.

“So I jumped from the table and I ran over to my phone to delete [the text], which I deleted my end, but clearly it didn’t delete her end. The next thing I know is Carole is texting me back and saying, ‘Well, how did you know? Because I’m having a biopsy on Monday,’ and I said ‘I’m so sorry. I am mortified.’ It’s something very personal and intrusive and I felt so awful.

“Of all the things to ask somebody. It’s not like, ‘Oh, have you got a toothache?’ It’s just the most dreadful thing to have happened and it makes me feel sick now talking about it.”

Why it happened is still a mystery. Christine said that she did not say “Hey Siri” or “Siri”, which is the wake word for Apple’s digital assistant. Siri can be asked using voice commands to do a range of tasks such as calling, texting or setting a calendar event or alarm.

The Apple website said: “to prevent iPhone from responding to ‘Siri’ or ‘Hey Siri,’ place your iPhone face down, or go to Settings > Siri (or Apple Intelligence & Siri), tap ‘Listen for,’ then choose Off.”

There is a function for Siri to automatically send messages under the “Messaging with Siri” menu, which skips the confirmation stage, but Christine did not have this turned on.

Allen, 72, from Hampshire, is retired but used to have a company that ran private medical businesses for consultants at the Nuffield Hospital in Guildford, so is only too aware of the needs for discretion and tact over health matters.

She said: “I’m quite resigned to the fact of whichever way the diagnosis goes. But I can imagine that somebody else … who was dreading it … it would cause an immense amount of pain and upset.”

Allen wanted to highlight the incident to voice concerns over the ubiquity of artificial intelligence. Most big tech companies are developing AI agents that will take on an increasing range of tasks for humans.

She added: “I’m very anti ‘AI anywhere’, and I see so much about AI and what a good thing it is and all I can think is that mankind is throwing away its autonomy.”

Christine has since deactivated Siri on her devices, but found that using them while driving was difficult without the assistant. “I’m kind of between a rock and a hard place,” she said.

Other Apple users have had similar mishaps with Siri. One wrote on Reddit that after typing a text message to his father while playing a video game, he said “I want be left the f*** alone” in response to action on the game, only for Siri to send that to his dad.

Apple has been criticised for the lack of progress that Siri has made, despite the advances of AI in recent years and the company has shaken up its leadership team as a result. A full overhaul of Siri is expected in 2027.

Siri, like Alexa and other voice assistants, has been at the centre of privacy controversies. In January Apple settled a US lawsuit brought by two plaintiffs who received targeted adverts for Air Jordan shoes or Olive Green restaurants after discussing them privately.

If you allow “Improve Siri and Dictation” on your devices private recordings can be retained by Apple and reviewed by staff who could access the names of contacts or apps to assess Siri’s response. There was also a bug in 2022 that enabled the recording of people who had opted out of this setting.

"New Sahha API Turning Health Data Into Personas, Powering Hyper-Personalized Engagement","Sahha, the behavioral health and lifestyle data company powering next-gen fitness and wellbeing products, today announced the public release of Sahha Archetypes, an API that transforms complex health data into simple, intuitive labels like night owl, highly active, or short sleeper. By mapping long-term patterns in activity, sleep, mental wellness and readiness, Archetypes provide a turnkey way for developers to understand who their users are and how they live, no clustering models required.

“Clicks and views alone don’t tell you much in the world of fitness and wellbeing. Serious companies need tangible data to build better, more relatable products,” said Aleks Dahlberg, Founder of Sahha. “With Archetypes, we turn raw signals into living personas, so digital experiences can behave more like a coach who truly ‘gets’ you and even adapt as your habits evolve.”

Instead of raw numbers, the API returns ready-to-use labels refreshed weekly or monthly. These fall into two types: ordinal (ranked, e.g., very-short → short → average → long sleeper) and categorical (distinct, e.g., early bird, night owl). This structure allows teams to benchmark progress, trigger context-aware nudges, and build lifestyle-aware UX in minutes.

As health, lifestyle and now longevity brands increasingly adopt generative AI to personalize user experiences, they require more than just raw data they need structured, meaningful insight. While APIs for collecting health data from wearables exist, making that data usable for people and AI is the real challenge. That’s where Sahha’s focus lies: turning raw signals into usable insights through its suite of Scores, Insights, and now Archetypes.

“Sahha Scores are the snapshot; Archetypes are the character arc,” added Sugam Budhraja, Head of Data & Science at Sahha. “Because they smooth out day-to-day noise, they’re perfect for automations, cohort analysis, and long-term habit change.”

Key capabilities developers can ship with one integration:

Persona segmentation – group users by real behaviours and traits, not assumptions.

– group users by real behaviours and traits, not assumptions. Dynamic user journeys – trigger emails, push notifications or in-app flows tailored to night-owls vs. early-risers, sedentary vs. highly-active, and more.

– trigger emails, push notifications or in-app flows tailored to night-owls vs. early-risers, sedentary vs. highly-active, and more. Cohort & retention analytics – compare engagement, LTV or outcomes between Archetype groups over time to refine strategy.

– weekly/monthly refresh captures evolving habits while historical back-fill provides two weeks of retrospective context at onboarding. Device-agnostic – works for smartphone-only and wearable users alike.

Archetypes join Scores, Biomarkers, and Insights in Sahha’s 2025 product suite, offering developers a complete pipeline from granular signals to high-level intelligence for crafting human-centric health and wellness experiences.

The Archetypes API is available today for all Sahha partners. Learn more at www.sahha.ai or reach out for a demo at www.sahha.ai/start.",https://insider.fitt.co/press-release/sahha-archetypes-api-turns-health-data-into-personas/,Technology
Signal Blocks Windows 11 Recall: ‘Microsoft Has Simply Given Us No Other Option’,"Image credit: Signal Private Messenger/Google Play Store

Signal messenger has rolled out a new security feature in its Windows Desktop app to shield users’ messages from Microsoft’s Recall tool, an AI-powered Windows 11 feature that records and indexes user activity.

The update prevents Recall from capturing screenshots of the Signal app window, with the company citing concerns over the security risks posed by such continuous screen recording. Users can still opt to disable the feature by adjusting their privacy settings within the app.

Recall works by taking screenshots roughly every three seconds and storing them in a searchable local database. Privacy and security practitioners quickly warned of the undue risks Recall created for Windows users, as well as the alternative platforms that interact with them.

Signal’s workaround for Recall

Signal raised concerns about the lack of developer-level controls in Windows 11, noting that privacy-focused apps are left with no standard way to opt out of Recall.

To address this, the company implemented a workaround using a Digital Rights Management setting — commonly used to block screen captures on streaming or media applications — to restrict Recall from logging what appears on Signal’s desktop interface.

The DRM-based block minimizes the chance of users having their private Signal messages screenshot by Recall and of it permanently indexing their private messages. However, it can also cause usability issues, like impairing the functionality of accessibility software or archiving the messages they prefer to document.

“Although Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that’s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk,” Signal officials wrote in a blog post on May 21.

“As a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs. Microsoft has simply given us no other option.”

Criticisms about Windows 11 Recall feature

Concerns surrounding the Windows 11 Recall feature are nothing new.

Upon Recall’s initial release in May 2024, its criticisms mostly involved the design of the product, such as how it was on by default and stored data in plaintext that can be easily accessed by apps with user system rights. Users also had limited options in terms of granular tools to control what content of their own would be aggregated within the solution’s inventory of data.

In response to backlash, Microsoft pulled Recall out of Windows 11 previews months after adding it. In April 2025, it reintroduced a revamped version of Recall last month. Changes include Recall now being an opt-in tool rather than one on by default, encryption to protect the database storing Recall data, and some user controls limiting the kind of content it indexes.

Still, privacy experts argue that vulnerabilities remain. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont, who performed a security research analysis of the reintroduced version of Recall, found that the tool still captures sensitive information and that its database can be decrypted using standard Windows authentication like a PIN or fingerprint scan.

Microsoft’s response

At the time of this writing, Microsoft has not publicly responded to inquiries about whether it plans to offer developers a formal API or mechanism to exclude their applications from Recall’s data capture in future updates.",https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-signal-blocks-windows-recall-privacy/,Technology
Real-world effectiveness of triple extrafine fixed-dose combination wi,"Introduction

Current strategies for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) focus on symptom alleviation and exacerbation reduction through various inhaled medication combinations.1 Triple fixed-dose combinations (FDC) incorporating inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABA), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) offer effective therapeutic strategies, potentially providing synergistic bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory effects.2–6

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide valuable insights into treatment efficacy and safety under controlled conditions, their findings may not fully reflect real-world clinical practice.7,8 This is particularly relevant with evolving drug development, which now includes biologics and potentially stem cell.9–12 Current combination therapies often target more specific patient populations, making traditional RCTs less practical for evaluating treatment effects in these contexts.13–16 Therefore, real-world evidence (RWE), derived from observational studies, plays an increasingly critical role in complementing RCT data, providing insights into effectiveness and safety across diverse patient populations.17,18 However, it is crucial to acknowledge biases in observational studies and the potential for misleading conclusions, especially for moderate treatment effects.19

In the first large real-world, retrospective, observational study of triple FDC in COPD, it was highlighted that in ICS-naïve COPD patients, the triple FDC was not more effective than dual bronchodilators in reducing exacerbation incidence, except in those with multiple exacerbations.20 However, a subsequent re-analysis, aligned with GOLD recommendations for COPD with a predominant exacerbation profile, suggested prioritizing triple FDC for patients in Group E and other exacerbating patients with an eosinophil count of ≥300 cells/µL.21

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates multicenter observational studies on the real-world effectiveness of a triple extrafine FDC containing beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), formoterol fumarate (FF), and glycopyrronium (G) on symptoms, measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, and lung function, measured by forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV 1 ). The CAT score contributes to the comprehensive assessment of COPD and guides clinicians in decision-making and patient management. It may improve communication between physicians and COPD patients, establishing it as a robust outcome measure in real-world studies.22–24 Additionally, a relationship exists between CAT and small airway dysfunction (SAD).25 FEV 1 is crucial due to its strong association with health-related quality of life in COPD patients, as demonstrated by the COSYCONET cohort,26 along with well-established correlations between FEV 1 and patient-reported outcomes.27

Preclinical studies demonstrated the synergistic bronchorelaxant effects of the BDP/FF/G triple combination in human airway smooth muscle, extending to both medium and small airways.2 This synergy suggests benefits beyond improved FEV 1 , potentially reducing SAD that is significantly associated with disease severity and symptoms.28–30 This triple FDC has demonstrated improvement in peak and trough FEV 1 as well as consistent reduction in airway resistance in patients with SAD.3

Effects of extrafine BDP/FF/G FDC in COPD have been evaluated in a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs registered in PROSPERO.31 This review reported a favorable efficacy and safety profile, ranking it similarly or superior to other triple FDCs according to the Implemented Bidimensional Surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis (IBiS) score. However, integrating RCT findings with quantitative RWE synthesis is essential for a comprehensive understanding of effectiveness.19 Thus, the aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate extrafine BDP/FF/G FDC effectiveness in COPD patients, focusing on its impact on symptoms and lung function in real-world clinical settings.

Methods

Search Strategy and Study Eligibility

The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was submitted in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42024614977) and performed in agreement with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.32,33 The relative flow diagram is shown in Figure 1. This study satisfied all the recommended items reported by the MOOSE checklist ( Table S1 ).33

Figure 1 PRISMA 2020 flow diagram for the identification of the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Abbreviation: PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

A comprehensive literature search was performed for prospective observational multicenter studies written in English and reporting data on CAT and FEV 1 in COPD patients.

In this regard, the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes) framework was applied to develop the literature search strategy, as previously reported.34 Namely, the “Population” included moderate-to-severe COPD in real-world patients; the “Intervention” regarded triple extrafine FDC with BDP/FF/G; the “Comparator” was any prior treatment for COPD not including triple extrafine FDC with BDP/FF/G; the “Outcomes” were CAT score and FEV 1 .

The search was performed in MEDLINE and SCOPUS to provide for relevant studies published with no time limit up to September 24th, 2024. The research string was as follows: “COPD AND beclomethasone AND formoterol AND glycopyrronium AND (observational OR real-world OR real-life)”. Table S2 reports the specific literature search used in MEDLINE and SCOPUS.

Study Selection

Prospective observational multicenter studies comparing triple extrafine FDC with BDP/FF/G with any prior treatment for COPD not including triple extrafine FDC with BDP/FF/G were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Either retrospective, cross-sectional, single center studies were excluded from the systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies not investigating triple extrafine FDC with BDP/FF/G, or retrospective, or single-center studies were excluded. Two reviewers independently examined the relevant studies identified from the literature search. The studies were selected in agreement with above mentioned criteria, and any difference in opinion concerning the eligibility was resolved by discussion leading to consensus.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted in agreement with Data Extraction for Complex Meta-anALysis (DECiMAL) recommendations35 from published papers and/or Supplementary Data Files. The extraction process included checks for study characteristics, treatment duration, number of analyzed patients, drugs, doses and regimen of administration, inhaler device, main inclusion criteria, age, sex, smoking history, exacerbations in the previous year, CAT score, FEV 1 , and study quality assessment via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Efficacy data were extracted at the specified time-points of the studies.

The inter- and intra-rater reliability for data abstraction was assessed via the Cohen’s Kappa score, as previously described.36 Cohen’s Kappa ≥0.80 indicated excellent agreement, coefficients between 0.61 and 0.80 represented substantial agreement, coefficients between 0.41 and 0.61 moderate agreement and <0.41 fair to poor agreement.36

Endpoints

The primary endpoint of this systematic review and meta-analysis was the CAT score, while FEV 1 was selected as the secondary endpoint.

Data Synthesis and Analysis

A pairwise meta-analysis was performed, and data were expressed as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Since data were selected from a series of observational studies performed by researchers operating independently and a common effect size cannot be assumed, binary random-effects model was used in order to balance the study weights and adequately estimate the 95% CI of the mean distribution of the MD for the investigated variables.37–39

A meta-regression using the random-effects method was also performed to investigate whether studies and patients’ characteristics may represent potential effect modifiers modulating the effectiveness of BDP/FF/G FDC in COPD patients. The meta-regression was carried out by plotting the outcome variables obtained from the pairwise meta-analysis with the co-variates extracted from the included studies.40,41 The following co-variates were included in the meta-regression analysis: study duration, prior treatment, age, sex, smoking habit, exacerbation history, blood eosinophils, FEV 1 at baseline, CAT at baseline, NOS. The resulting regression coefficient indicates how strongly the co-variates may modify the effect induced by BDP/FF/G FDC.41

Quality of the Studies, Risk of Bias, and Evidence Profile

The NOS was used to assess the quality of the studies.42 A study can be awarded with a maximum of one star for each item within the “Selection” and “Outcome” categories and a maximum of two stars can be given for “Comparability”. In the present systematic review, the NOS quality assessment score was established to be in the range between zero and a maximum of nine stars. Detailed information on the NOS scale is available at https://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/nosgen.pdf . Studies reporting a total NOS score ≥7 were considered of high quality, whereas those reporting a total NOS score <7 were considered of low quality.43

The test for heterogeneity (I2) was performed to quantify the between-study dissimilarity44 and sensitivity analyses were carried out according to study design to identify the studies that introduced significant (P < 0.05) and/or substantial levels of heterogeneity (I2 > 50%).45

The risk of publication bias was assessed by applying the funnel plot and Egger’s test as previously described.46,47 The equation of Egger’s test was as follows: SND = a + b × precision, where SND represents the standard normal deviation (log of the odds ratio divided by its standard error (SE)), and precision represents the reciprocal of the SE. Evidence of asymmetry from Egger’s test was considered to be significant at P <0.1, and the graphical representation of 90% confidence bands is presented.46,47

The quality of the evidence was assessed for the primary endpoint according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, indicating ⨁⨁⨁⨁ for high-quality of evidence, ⨁⨁⨁ for moderate-quality of evidence, ⨁⨁ for low-quality of evidence, and ⨁ for very low-quality of evidence.48

Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of studies, risk bias, and evidence profile, and any difference in opinion was resolved by consensus.

Software and Statistical Significance

Open-MetaAnalyst and metaHUN software were used to perform the pairwise meta-analysis, funnel plot, and Egger’s test ( http://softmed.hacettepe.edu.tr/metaHUN/ );49,50 the visual analysis of symmetry/asymmetry of funnel plots was performed by using ChatGPT (GPT4o), an advanced Artificial Intelligence used as a model for quantitative questions;51 the quality of evidence assessed using the GRADEpro GDT software.48 The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05.

Study Characteristics

The meta-analysis included 7 multicenter, observational, prospective, real-world studies52–58 examining the effectiveness of a triple extrafine FDC with BDP/FF/G in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. A total of 5952 patients were analyzed across these studies. Importantly, all seven studies achieved a total NOS score of ≥7, indicating high methodological quality. The studies varied in duration (24 to 52 weeks), sample size, and specific inclusion criteria; however, all focused on patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. The studies encompassed diverse prior treatment regimens. The history of exacerbation and blood eosinophils were available only in two studies (55,58 and,52,53 respectively), therefore, the meta-regression analysis was not performed on these co-variates. Not all the studies reported FEV 1 with the same metrics (% predicted or mL). Detailed information on the characteristics of the studies is reported in Table 1, while Figure 2 illustrates the prevalence of prior treatments among the analyzed COPD population.

The inter-rater reliability for data abstraction was excellent before and after the learning process (Cohen’s Kappa 0.95 and 1.00, respectively). The intra-rater reliability produced a Cohen’s Kappa of 1.00 after the learning process.

Primary Endpoint – CAT Score

The overall meta-analysis showed a statistically significant (P < 0.001) MD in CAT score between the BDP/FF/G FDC group and the prior treatments groups (MD −5.82 95% CI −7.61 – −4.03; ⨁⨁⨁⨁; Figure 3A). Substantial and statistically significant (P < 0.001) heterogeneity was observed across the studies (I² = 97.52%).

Abbreviations: BDP, beclomethasone dipropionate; CAT, COPD Assessment Test, COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FDC, fixed-dose combination; FF, formoterol fumarate; G, glycopyrronium; MD, mean difference; MITT, multiple-inhaler triple therapy.

There was a clear asymmetry in the funnel plot, with more studies clustered to the left (showing a larger negative MD) and a relative lack of studies on the right (indicating a less negative MD) ( Figure S1 ). There were also some outliers with larger SE. However, the Egger’s test for publication bias was not statistically significant (P = 0.548).

The meta-regression analysis revealed that no factors, including study duration, significantly (P > 0.05) modified the effectiveness of BDP/FF/G FDC on CAT scores; only the use of multiple-inhaler triple therapy (MITT) at baseline showed a trend towards significance (coefficient 0.034, P = 0.091; Figure 3B).

Secondary Endpoint – FEV 1

The overall meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant (P < 0.001) improvement in FEV 1 with the BDP/FF/G FDC compared to prior treatments (% predicted MD 4.21 95% CI 2.29–6.12; mL MD 127 95% CI 42–212; Figure 4A and B, respectively). Substantial and statistically significant (P < 0.001) heterogeneity was present across the studies for FEV 1 reported as % predicted and mL (I² = 78.10% and 73.12%, respectively).

Figure 4 Forest plot showing the effectiveness of BDP/FF/G FDC on FEV 1 expressed as % predicted (A) and mL (B) compared to prior treatments in moderate-to-severe COPD patients. Abbreviations: BDP, beclomethasone dipropionate; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FDC, fixed-dose combination; FEV 1 , forced expiratory volume in the 1st second; FF, formoterol fumarate; G, glycopyrronium; MD, mean difference.

Funnel plots ( Figure S2 ) suggested potential publication bias for FEV 1 , with an asymmetry indicating an overrepresentation of studies showing larger positive effects and few studies reporting smaller MD. For FEV 1 expressed as % predicted, Egger’s test confirmed this bias (P < 0.01). However, excluding the TRIWIN study56 in a sensitivity analysis fully resolved this bias, resulting in a not significant Egger’s test (P = 0.124). Concerning FEV 1 expressed as mL, Egger’s test showed no statistically significant publication bias (P = 0.229), and a sensitivity analysis was not necessary.

Meta-regression analysis on the effect of BDP/FF/G FDC on FEV 1 expressed as % predicted identified smoking habit as a significant effect modifier (coefficient 0.160, P < 0.05), with current smokers showing a greater treatment effect than non-smokers and reported a trend toward significance for male sex (coefficient 0.172, P = 0.067). Concerning the effect of BDP/FF/G FDC on FEV 1 expressed as mL, male sex was associated with a significantly larger treatment effect (coefficient 8.182, P < 0.01), current smokers experienced a significantly greater improvement than non-smokers (coefficient 10.496, P < 0.001), and greater baseline FEV 1 values were associated with a significantly larger treatment effect (coefficient 17.047, P < 0.05).

In the meta-regression analysis, when the co-variate “smoking habit” was analyzed together with the co-variate “use of ICS”, the coefficient changed by only ±1.10% compared to the value obtained for “smoking habit” alone. This indicates that the improvement in FEV 1 observed with BDP/FF/G FDC among current smokers was not significantly (P > 0.05) modulated by previous ICS treatment.

No other co-variates, including study duration, were identified as potential effect modifiers of BDP/FF/G FDC on FEV 1 expressed as % predicted and mL. Detailed information on meta-regression analysis of secondary endpoint is shown in Figure S3 .

Discussion

COPD has emerged as a major global health challenge, characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is progressive in nature and linked to significant symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.1 The management of COPD has evolved considerably, with recommendations emphasizing the importance of integrated and individualized treatment strategies to alleviate symptoms and minimize the risk of exacerbation.1 In recent years, RWE has gained traction as it provides insights into treatment effectiveness beyond the controlled environments of RCTs, particularly for complex and multifactorial conditions such as COPD.59–61 Within this context, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate with high-quality of evidence that triple extrafine FDC with BDP/FF/G is statistically effective in enhancing both health status, as measured by the CAT score, and lung function assessed through FEV 1 in moderate-to-severe COPD patients in a real-world setting. Notably, the significant improvements observed were clinically meaningful, with the CAT score showing a MD of ≃-6 and a corresponding minimal clinically important difference (MCID) threshold of ≥2, while FEV 1 revealed an MD of ≃130 mL, exceeding the MCID of ≥60 mL vs active comparator.62,63 These findings underline the therapeutic potential of the triple therapy, reflecting significant progress in managing COPD symptoms and lung function when compared to prior treatments, regardless of what they may be.

Like for previous well-performed meta-analyses of observational studies,43,64,65 a critical aspect of the present study is the detection of significant heterogeneity across studies. The I2 values resulting for CAT and FEV 1 indicate variability in participant response, study design, or treatment effect analysis.45 However, despite this heterogeneity, the Egger’s test did not suggest significant bias affecting the outcome estimates. This finding is important because it indicates that, while study characteristics may vary, the overall effectiveness of the triple FDC therapy has clinically relevant implications, showing consistent positive outcomes across diverse populations and prior treatments.66,67 In other words, the direction of the effect estimates in this meta-analysis is correct, and adding data from future investigations may a yield narrower 95% CI range.43 Furthermore, the meta-regression approach for studying the potential effect modifiers aids in interpreting individual studies, providing a lens through which different studies can contribute to a solid evidence pyramid.68,69 Thus, this meta-analysis strongly supports the adoption of the BDP/FF/G FDC in clinical practice.

In assessing factors that may influence the effectiveness of the triple therapy, the analysis revealed that neither demographic nor baseline characteristic significantly modulated the effectiveness of the BDP/FF/G FDC combination on CAT scores. This is another important point, as it implies a generally uniform response to the therapy irrespective of patient demographics or prior treatment status; however, as expected, a trend towards significance in baseline use of MITT indicates the potential for further exploration of treatment pathways for these patients.70,71 In contrast, the meta-regression analysis indicated multiple factors that did affect the effectiveness of the triple therapy on FEV 1 . Notably, male patients exhibited greater treatment benefits relative to female patients, aligning with known biological differences in pathophysiology of COPD.72–75 Additionally, the influence of smoking status was profound as current smokers showed better treatment outcomes than non-smokers, suggesting that habit patterns play a pivotal role in treatment response. Unexpectedly, we found that the beneficial impact of BDP/FF/G FDC on the lung function of current smokers was not related to the use or non-use of ICS in prior treatments. This finding contrasts with previous studies suggesting that COPD patients who smoke may exhibit partial resistance to ICS, as cigarette smoke significantly reduces the activity and expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), an enzyme crucial for suppressing inflammatory gene expression.76,77 We cannot rule out that HDAC2 inhibition in smokers may influence the risk of exacerbation, an outcome not reported in the studies included in this meta-analysis. However, while it has been demonstrated that heavier or current smokers do not gain the same benefit from ICS use on lung function and exacerbation rates as lighter or ex-smokers, these effects do not appear to reach the MCID.78 Furthermore, patients with less severely affected lung function at baseline benefited more from the therapy, reinforcing the importance of early intervention in the COPD treatment landscape.79,80

This investigation emerges as the first of its kind meta-analysis and meta-regression focused specifically on the effectiveness of triple ICS/LABA/LAMA therapy within real-world COPD populations derived from prospective studies. The findings articulate a strong case for the integration of this therapeutic strategy into clinical practice, underscoring the clinical importance of individualized treatment approaches, whereby patient characteristics can significantly dictate outcomes, thereby necessitating specific patient selection for maximized therapeutic benefits.81,82

In terms of practical implications for clinicians, the positive outcomes reflected by both the CAT and FEV 1 metrics confirm the incorporation of the extrafine BDP/FF/G FDC into therapeutic regimens for COPD management. Given the nature of COPD as a chronic disease with multifaceted symptoms, the efficacy of this therapy is likely to enhance patient quality of life while simultaneously addressing lung function decline, integral to disease management.83 Moreover, by capturing real-world effectiveness, these data directly contribute to evidence-based practice, encouraging physicians to align with treatment options that yield significant real-world benefits for their patients.60

Overall, this meta-analysis affirms the effectiveness of the triple extrafine FDC with BDP/FF/G in real-world settings, addressing a critical gap between controlled clinical trial outcomes and everyday clinical treatment experiences. With continued emphasis on personalized medicine,81,84 future studies should endeavor to delineate distinct patient subgroups for which this therapy demonstrates optimal effectiveness. Additionally, further investigation is warranted to explore the long-term outcomes associated with the use of the triple ICS/LABA/LAMA FDC in varied populations, including those with different comorbidities and treatment histories.85,86 Understanding the factors that maximize treatment effectiveness will enable clinicians to tailor therapy more effectively to individual patients. Future studies should also consider conducting head-to-head trials between triple therapy and dual therapy regimens to directly compare their effects in real-world scenarios.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis highlights the significant role of the triple extrafine BDP/FF/G FDC in improving health status and lung function in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD in a real-world context. The findings support the continued use and investigation of this combination therapy as a critical strategy in COPD management.",https://www.dovepress.com/real-world-effectiveness-of-triple-extrafine-fixed-dose-combination-wi-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-COPD,Technology
PNNL researchers study common lithium salt for cheaper and quicker battery manufacturing - Charged EVs,"Scientists at the US Department of Energy‘s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have recently discovered that the sublimation of lithium oxide, when mixed with nickel-rich cathode precursors, creates a single-crystal structure that could be used in longer-lasting batteries.

In a new finding published in Nature Energy, the PNNL-led team showed that vapor from lithium oxide (Li2O) sublimation—the process whereby a solid turns directly into a vapor—accelerates a chemical reaction that forms single crystals when mixed with nickel-rich precursors. The sublimation happens at just one atmosphere of pressure, the everyday pressure felt at sea level. Single-crystal battery materials are thought to help batteries last longer and could help decrease the cost of battery manufacturing.

“The discovery offers a potentially faster, more efficient, and cheaper way to scale up the manufacturing of nickel-rich lithium-ion batteries,” said Jie Xiao, co-author on the paper and a Battelle Fellow who holds a joint appointment with PNNL and the University of Washington. At UW, Xiao is the university’s Boeing Martin Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department. “The research shows us how materials science can be applied to simplify the manufacturing process,” Xiao continued.

Nickel-rich lithium cathode material tends to form as agglomerations known as “polycrystals.” Boundaries between the crystals become weaker as the battery discharges and charges. Over time, these weaknesses lead to cracking, which degrades the battery and shortens its lifetime.

“You can imagine all those tiny particles are agglomerated together, and they get pushed and pulled as the battery charges and discharges,” Xiao said. “The movement can create cracks, which weakens the battery.”

“Single-crystal cathodes don’t have the vulnerabilities that arise from polycrystal structures,” Xiao said. “So, we hope single crystals will mitigate and eventually eliminate all the big challenges in nickel-rich cathode materials.”

However, the team has more work to do before any batteries can be produced, Xiao said. Because Li2O is not broadly used for materials synthesis, the cost to use it commercially is currently too high. However, Xiao noted that Li 2 O is easily produced by processing other lithium salts, such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH).

Xiao and her team are now working with industry partners to scale up the process while maintaining lower manufacturing costs and aim to provide single crystals to their strategic partners in 2026.

"Microsoft adds new AI features to Paint, Snipping Tool, and Notepad","Microsoft has announced new AI-powered features for Paint, Snipping Tool, and Notepad in Windows 11. They are now rolling out to Windows Insiders using Canary and Dev builds, though some are limited to Copilot+ PCs.

For Paint, the company is adding a feature to generate stickers using artificial intelligence. To do this, Microsoft's graphics editor will have a new button in the Copilot menu, where users can enter a text hint and description of the desired sticker. Once created, users can immediately copy the sticker for use in other applications or save it to their device. This feature is limited to Copilot+ computers.

Additionally, Paint will also feature Smart Object Selection, which will use artificial intelligence to highlight specific things in an image. Finally, Paint will also feature a new start window that will notify users of recent updates and new features.

Two new features are being added to Snippint Tool – the ability to take a ""perfect"" screenshot, as well as the ability to identify any color on the screen.

Perfect Screenshot will use artificial intelligence to analyze the content on the screen and capture it accurately without the need for users to manually crop or edit the image. This feature will also be limited to Copilot+ computers.

Microsoft is also adding the ability to identify any color on the screen. To do this, in the Snippint Tool, you need to select Select Color from the menu and hover over any element on the screen. After that, you can get the color in HEX, RGB, or HSL values.

Microsoft also announced new generative AI features for Notepad. Users will be able to edit or create text in a document using artificial intelligence: just place the cursor in the desired place and select the Write command via the menu or by using the Ctrl + Q combination. If users do not want to use the AI capabilities, they can be turned off in the settings.

Recall, it recently became known that Microsoft is developing a new feature for Windows 11 called Cross Device Resume, which will work similarly to Handoff in Apple's macOS.",https://mezha.media/en/news/paint-snippint-tool-and-notepad-ai-features-302215/,Technology
Valve founder Gabe Newell invested in a startup producing brain chips for medicine,"Valve founder Gabe Newell has backed a new startup called Starfish Technologies, which is developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to treat neurological disorders, TechSpot reports.

Starfish Technologies is not related to the gaming industry in any way - the new company is focused on medical applications. Its first chips should appear by the end of 2025. The developers are working on miniature, energy-efficient and wireless implants that will be able to read and stimulate activity in multiple areas of the brain at once.

The technology is aimed at disorders associated with impaired neural connectivity, such as Parkinson's disease. Starfish is looking for partners among experts in wireless power transfer, neural interfaces, and communication systems.

Valve has previously explored brain implants in a gaming context, and Sony, Tencent, and Apple are also showing interest in the technology. However, Starfish wants to focus on medical use cases first.

Starfish has already released the technical specifications of its chip. The device measures 2×4 mm and consumes only 1.1 mW of power during standard recording. It is capable of recording brain activity (spikes and local field potentials) from 16 channels simultaneously at a frequency of 18.75 kHz, using 32 electrodes. The chip also supports electrical stimulation, has built-in impedance monitoring, voltage measurement during stimulation, and digital signal processing, which allows it to work through low-speed wireless interfaces. The chip is manufactured using the TSMC 55 nm process technology.

By the way, Starfish's main competitor is Neuralink, a company founded by Elon Musk. Neuralink is already testing its BCI systems on humans - the first patient received the implant in January 2024, and as of now its functionality has been preserved, despite some disconnection of some of the threads.

Neuralink uses a more massive implant with 1,024 electrodes, consumes about 6 mW of power, and requires periodic wireless charging. The company is targeting both medical and experimental brain interface scenarios.",https://mezha.media/en/news/gabe-newell-backed-brain-chip-startup-302214/,Technology

Apple's new HomePod will have a display, and it might arrive later this year.

This is according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman (via 9to5Mac), who claims that the device will launch ""by the end of this year,"" though he admits that the timing is uncertain.

The new device will be a smart home speaker with an added display (a 7-inch one, previous rumors claim), that should one day become a centerpiece of Apple's smart home tech. Other features, per previous reports, includes support for Apple Intelligence, a camera, smart home controls, and a rechargeable battery. While the device will have a built-in speaker, Apple will likely position it as a smart hub instead of just a home speaker.

Bovensiepen Zagato Debuts As A 602-HP Grand Tourer With Alpina DNA,"Burkard Bovensiepen founded Alpina in 1965 as a company to tune and race BMWs. Over the years, the two companies became very close, including Alpina products being available directly from some BMW dealers. In 2022, BMW bought Alpina, but the deal allowed the tuner to continue building its own cars through the end of 2025.

When the companies announced the deal, Alpina CEO Florian Bovensiepen said this wasn't the death of his family's automotive work. Future models would carry the Bovensiepen brand name. ""With our in-depth expertise and know-how, we will continue to bring different but impressive mobility offerings to market,"" he said at the time.

This year's Fuori Concorso show at Villa Grumello on the shores of Lake Como provided the first preview of the company's future with the introduction of the Bovensiepen Zagato. The new brand plans to begin delivering this gorgeous grand touring coupe at the end of the second quarter of 2026. No pricing or availability details are available yet.

A Closer Look At The Bovensiepen Zagato

Close

As the model's name suggests, Bovensiepen is doing the engineering work, and Zagato is responsible for the design. The styling includes a broad grille with stainless steel mesh and large inlets in the lower corners. The Bovensiepen brand name is on the lower fascia, in a position similar to where Alpina often places its name mark. The car rides on 20-inch wheels with 10 pairs of tuning-fork-shaped spokes.

The profile gives away that the BMW M4 is the donor vehicle for the new Bovensiepen grand tourer. However, there are notable changes to the styling, such as:

A U-shaped aerodynamic air outlet on the hood

A double-bubble roof and matching element for the rear window

Full retractable frameless windows

Integrated rear ducktail spoiler

Zagato Chief Designer Norihiko Harada said his goal for the exterior design was to blend ""Italian charm"" and ""an architectural German structure."" Each production car will require 250 hours of labor to build and include more than 400 custom components.

The interior has much more obvious BMW bones because the dashboard layout is straight from the M4. Bovensiepen accents the cabin by covering it with blue leather upholstery and using the same color for the headliner. The new company's badge is on the headrests and steering wheel.

""Our goal is to build cars for connoisseurs and enthusiasts who appreciate the perfect symbiosis of design and technology,"" – said Andreas Bovensiepen, CEO of Bovensiepen Automobiles.

Serious Performance

Close

The brand's announcement doesn't specify the Bovensiepen Zagato's powertrain. However, it allegedly packs a version of the M4's 3.0-liter inline-six, according to info that BMW Blog obtained. The engine reportedly pumps out 602 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, making it significantly more powerful than the 543-horsepower and 479-pound-feet tune in the current BMW M4 CS . An eight-speed automatic routes power to an all-wheel-drive system. The setup gets the grand tourer to 62 miles per hour in 3.3 seconds, and the top speed is over 186 miles per hour.

TopSpeed's Take

Zagato



There's still a lot that we don't know about the Bovensiepen Zagato, but it's shaping up to be an intriguing take on the grand tourer. Over its decades in business, Alpina became a specialist at building speedy BMWs that were also comfortable road cars. The family hasn't lost its touch with the new Bovensiepen, judging by the little bit of information available so far.

Since the production version is still roughly a year away, there's still a little time for things to change. We'd like to see Bovensiepen differentiate the grand tourer's interior a little more from its BMW donor vehicle.",https://www.topspeed.com/bovensiepen-zagato-debuts/,Technology
Kverneland equips ISOBUS machines with proprietary telemetry,"Kverneland equips ISOBUS machines with proprietary telemetry 20-05 | Smart farming | News The grey box is Kverneland’s so-called Sync. It provides ISOBUS machines with telemetry. – Photos: Kverneland

The Norwegian machinery manufacturer Kverneland is now equipping ISOBUS machines with a Sync box. This connects machine data to the cloud.

ISOBUS machines from Kverneland, Vicon and Kubota have been fitted with a so-called Sync box since this year, enabling machine data to be connected to the cloud. The ‘Sync’ is connected to the diagnostic port of the ECU (computer) of the ISOBUS machine. This allows machine data to be viewed within Kverneland’s farm management system, IsoMatch FarmCentre.

Remote service

This makes it possible for dealers to read sensor values remotely in the event of a malfunction. It also prepares the manufacturer for the use of implements in combination with an autonomous tractor or field robot. In the latter case, the implement can be monitored remotely via ISOBUS data.

Some functions of the Sync box are the same as those of Kverneland’s Tellus ISOBUS terminal. The difference is that this machine data is now also available when the ISOBUS machine is operated using the tractor’s ISOBUS terminal.

Read more below the photo

Equipped with Bluetooth connectivity

The Sync is also equipped with Bluetooth connectivity. This allows you to connect with your phone to synchronise data for implement apps. For example, users of a spreading chart app no longer need to manually input various data into the app – the data is transferred automatically via the Bluetooth connection.

Finally, the Sync features tracking and geofencing. This means you will receive a notification if the machine moves outside a designated area. It also helps prevent theft.

The Sync is fitted as standard on ISOBUS machines manufactured after 1 January 2025. Those who do not wish to share their data can opt out. Alternatively, the plug can simply be disconnected.

GTA 6 story mode expected to be the longest in franchise history,"Amid the wait for Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6, a new rumour about the game’s story mode has triggered another debate among fans.

The sixth title in the Rockstar Games franchise was initially scheduled for release in Fall 2025.

However, the developer announced delaying it to mid-2026 to further improve the upcoming title.

Days later, Rockstar Games released the second trailer for GTA 6 and confirmed that it featured actual gameplay footage and cutscenes.

“Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5, comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes,” the studio wrote in its X post.

While the developer has not disclosed details about the GTA 6 story mode, a rumour has emerged online, suggesting the longest story mode in franchise history.

GTA 6 Media, an X handle which regularly posts on the game, stated that the main story was expected to span 45–50 hours.

“It’s not official, GTA VI is estimated at 45–50 hours for the main story and potentially 100+ hours for full completion,” the post read.

If true, this would make GTA 6 the title with the longest story mode, surpassing GTA 5, which took around 32 hours.

It is worth noting here that the second trailer of GTA 6 also showed a glimpse of Vice City, which was previously the setting for 2002’s Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.

“Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive,” reads Rockstar Games’ official description for GTA 6.",https://arynews.tv/gta-6-story-mode-expected-to-be-the-longest-in-franchise-history/,Technology
Smart phonon control boosts efficiency in eco-friendly thermoelectric material,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

A research team has discovered how to make a promising energy-harvesting material much more efficient—without relying on rare or expensive elements. The material, called β-Zn 4 Sb 3 , is a tellurium-free thermoelectric compound that can convert waste heat into electricity.

In their study published in Advanced Science, scientists used advanced neutron scattering techniques to peek inside the crystal and found something surprising: tiny heat vibrations (called phonons) were being disrupted by ""rattling"" atoms inside the structure. This phenomenon, known as phonon avoided crossing, dramatically slowed down how heat travels through the material.

Thanks to this effect, the material's thermal conductivity dropped to extremely low levels—great news for thermoelectric performance. Even better, the researchers found that the single-crystal version of this material also conducts electricity better than its polycrystalline counterpart, reaching a high power conversion efficiency of 1.4%.

These results show that smart phonon control can lead to high-performance, eco-friendly materials for converting heat into power.

In thermoelectric materials, avoided crossing refers to the interaction between propagating phonons and localized vibrational modes, where their energy dispersions repel each other rather than intersect. This phenomenon occurs under specific conditions, such as crystal symmetries or vibrational mode couplings.

However, when researchers developed the single-crystal β-Zn 4 Sb 3 , they observed an unexpected, avoided crossing, revealing unique phonon behavior that deviated from conventional thermoelectric materials.

The article explores the thermoelectric performance of single-crystalline β-Zn 4 Sb 3 , a tellurium-free material, by uncovering the microscopic mechanisms that lead to its ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (κ L ).

Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS), the researchers provide the first experimental observation of avoided crossing between longitudinal acoustic phonons and low-energy rattling modes. This interaction causes a significant reduction in phonon group velocity—from over 4000 m/s to about 591 m/s—and shortens phonon lifetimes to under 1 picosecond, both of which contribute to strongly suppressed heat transport.

The β-Zn 4 Sb 3 single crystal achieves a κ L of approximately 0.36 W/m·K in the 300–600 K range and a peak thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of 1.0 at 623 K. Additionally, device-level testing shows a conversion efficiency (η) of 1.4% in a single-leg thermoelectric module—one of the highest reported for undoped Zn 4 Sb 3 .

Structural characterizations via TEM reveal a grain-boundary-free lattice with uniformly distributed moiré fringes, attributed to Zn concentration variations.

These nanoscale features further enhance phonon scattering without degrading electronic performance. Compared to polycrystalline samples, the single crystal exhibits significantly better electrical conductivity due to fewer defects and optimized carrier mobility.

""This discovery shows how heat flow can be engineered to design more efficient and sustainable energy technologies—without depending on scarce resources,"" says Prof. Hsin-Jay Wu.

"ED Alert Boosts A1c Testing, Not Glycemic Control","TOPLINE:

An emergency department (ED)–based alert led to a higher rate of A1c testing among patients with diabetes overdue for routine monitoring but did not significantly improve long-term glycemic control.

METHODOLOGY:

In this retrospective study, the researchers analyzed 348,490 ED visits by patients with diabetes from January 2017 to September 2023.

In November 2017, an alert was added to the ED Information System for 13,609 patients with diabetes within the health system who were noncompliant with routine biannual A1c testing. The intervention targeted patients already undergoing blood tests.

The primary outcome was the ordering of an A1c test, and the secondary outcome was the change in A1c levels on follow-up testing (> 30 days after the index test).

TAKEAWAY:

Following the alert's implementation, physicians ordered A1c tests for 1442 noncompliant patients.

A1c testing among noncompliant patients increased from 1.5% to 12.1% (P < .001), peaking at 22.5% in the first year but declining to 5.1% by 6 years.

Among patients with follow-up data, the average decrease in A1c was −0.42, which was not significantly different from the preintervention decrease of −0.60 (P = .40).

Only 15% of noncompliant patients achieved the target A1c level (< 7.0), whereas 26% of the general ED population reached this goal (P = .013).

IN PRACTICE:

""A targeted ED intervention was associated with increased testing for A1c; however, the effects decreased over time without educational communication,"" the authors wrote. ""While the program demonstrates operational feasibility, it does not appear to result in significant improvements in A1c levels relative to the overall ED population,"" they added.

SOURCE:

The study was led by Daniel L. Shaw, MD, MCSO, Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. It was published online on May 15, 2025, in The Journal of Emergency Medicine.

LIMITATIONS:

The study's retrospective design and reliance on a single institution's database limited generalizability. The classification of ""noncompliance"" might have misrepresented patients early in the calendar year. The COVID-19 pandemic during the study period could have affected ED use, follow-up, and testing compliance.

DISCLOSURES:

This study did not receive any outside funding or sponsorship. The authors did not disclose any conflicts of interest.

Google Search Console to show AI Mode performance but you won’t be able to break it out,"Google has confirmed that you will be able to see AI Mode performance data in the Search Console performance reports but you won’t be able to break out that data individually to see how AI Mode is performing compared to web search or other Google surfaces.

Last week, Google rolled out AI Mode to all US searchers and when AI Mode launched in labs in March, Google told us then that since it was in Labs, it would not be reported in Search Console. Now that it is out of Labs, the data will come to Search Console.

What Google said. As I reported and also mentioned in my story on the future of SEO and search, John Mueller from Google confirmed on my LinkedIn post saying:

Al Mode reporting is not yet live in Search Console. We’re updating our documentation to reflect this will be showing soon as part of the Al Mode rollout.

He later added:

Hey, for sake of clarity because I worry you’re reading something different into this, the reporting is planned to be added to Search Console like we wrote here. There’s currently no separate break-out planned, and no API change involved. Stay tuned for more specifics – perhaps next week, but as always, we can’t promise specific timelines.

The updated help document to note this as well (I bolded some parts to emphasize them), saying:

Just like the rest of the search results page, sites appearing in AI features (such as AI Overviews and AI Mode) are included in the overall search traffic in Search Console. (Note: AI Mode reporting isn’t live in Search Console yet, but we expect this soon as part of the AI Mode rollout.) In particular, they’re reported on in the Performance report, within the “Web” search type. Learn more about how various Search features are counted towards the overall data in Search Console, how to analyze traffic changes overall, and how to combine Search Console and Analytics data.

AI Mode tracking. Earlier, there was a “bug” that impacted AI Mode being untrackable. Google is still working on fixing this bug. But for now, tracking AI Mode is almost impossible and we don’t have ways to fully see this in Search Console.

Ads. And you won’t be able to break out how your ads are performing with AI Overviews or AI Mode, even now that ads are live in AI Overviews and being tested in AI Mode. So much for all those mentions of “control and transparency” at Google Marketing Live.

Why we care. AI Mode is the future of search but for now, and the foreseeable future, you won’t be able to really track the performance of your organic and paid campaigns with AI Mode in Google Search.

We want to be able to see this data broken out in ads and organic and within Search Console’s performance reports, we would likely want it here:

We can continue to be loud about this and reach out to Google about wanting to be able to see this data.I know I’ve expressed my concern about this to the highest level at Google but right now, the answer is, this is not coming anytime soon.",https://searchengineland.com/google-search-console-to-show-ai-mode-performance-but-you-wont-be-able-to-break-it-out-455992,Technology
A Regal Tribute: Blancpain Unveils Ladybird Colors Royal Purple,"Blancpain celebrates feminine elegance and artisanal excellence with the launch of a stunning new capsule edition in its Ladybird Colors collection: Royal Purple. This rich, majestic hue joins a bold and vibrant palette including raspberry pink, lilac, midnight blue, coral blue, apple green, peacock green, forest green, turquoise, lemon sorbet yellow, and white.

The Ladybird has a storied history that dates back to 1956, when it debuted with the smallest round mechanical movement ever created for women’s watches: the R-52, measuring just 11.85mm in diameter. Housed in a minimalist case with the crown discreetly placed on the case back, this daring design challenged the norms of an era when ladies’ watches were expected to remain understated. Over the years, the Ladybird has seen continuous refinement— most notably in 1995 with the introduction of the ultra-slim automatic calibre 615, still powering today’s Ladybird Ultraplate models.

At the heart of the new Ladybird Colors lies an iridescent dial crafted from nacre perlée, a rare and exceptionally luminous variety of mother-of-pearl. Harvested from the domed centers of specially cultivated mollusks, this refined material is found in less than two percent of usable mother-of-pearl. Framing this exclusive dial are twelve Roman numerals rendered in deep Royal Purple, encircled by two diamond-set rings. One of these rings artfully showcases the moon phase complication— a signature Blancpain feature, reintroduced to the dial in 1983 following the quartz crisis. The moon itself, flanked by delicate stars, bears a human face adorned with a tiny beauty mark on its right cheek. Adding to its charm are Blancpain’s signature openworked sage leaf-shaped hands, gracefully sweeping over the dial to mark hours and minutes.

As her sister models, the new Ladybird Colors— Reference 3662D-1954-55 in white gold and 3662E-2954-55 in red gold— is presented in an elegantly proportioned 34.9mm case, standing 10.43mm tall. More than two carats of dazzling diamonds embellish the bezel, crown, lugs, and clasp. Completing the look is a vibrant alligator leather strap in matching Royal Purple.

Inside beats the caliber 1163L, an automatic movement with an impressive 100-hour power reserve. Equipped with a silicon balance spring— resistant to magnetic fields and a game-changer in 21st-century horology— the caliber exemplifies modern mechanical precision. Through the transparent sapphire caseback, the movement reveals its full beauty, showcasing Geneva stripes and a skeletonized rotor.

Pricing is marked at $38,300.

Testing for Pulmonary Issues as a PCP: What to Know,"Examining a patient for common or complex pulmonary issues in a primary care setting takes time and expertise — physicians need to ask about symptoms and medical history and determine which tests to perform to narrow down the differential diagnosis. In an ideal world, every primary care setting features lung function tests and multiple imaging capabilities on-site, and cost and insurance reimbursement are not limitations.

But it’s not an ideal world. With that in mind, Medscape Medical News asked leading primary care physicians (PCPs) for their advice and insight on navigating the realities of assessing patients for multiple pulmonary issues.

Wilson Pace, MD

When it comes to testing on-site, it depends on what is available, said Wilson Pace, MD, professor emeritus of family medicine at the University of Colorado Denver, and at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, who currently works as chief medical and technology officer at the DARTNet Institute. “Even a simple chest x-ray can help you distinguish a heart failure picture from a more pulmonary picture.”

However, not every primary care service has x-ray capability, said Alan Kaplan, MD, chair of the Family Physician Airways Group of Canada. Kaplan was a lead author of a case study that describes a 52-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) who complained to her family doctor of breathlessness. The case outlines practical aspects of diagnosis and management in this setting, including what to consider when someone with COPD starts to develop heart failure.

Alan Kaplan, MD

Initial questions to ask patients include: What are your symptoms? Is it just a cough? Is it a cough and shortness of breath? A shortness of breath at rest or just with exertion? Is there an associated chest pain?

“Answers to all of those things will help define which directions and which tests you are going to get,” said Neil Skolnik, MD, professor of family and community medicine at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia. On physical exam, if there is a lot of wheezing, think more along the lines of a respiratory condition. If there is a crackling sound in the chest, think more about heart failure, Skolnik said.

Ruling out urgent heart issues remains important.

“Everybody is going to probably start with an ECG rhythm strip. You want to make sure that there isn’t something electrical with the heart going on,” said Barbara Yawn, MD, researcher and adjunct professor of family and community health at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. An ECG is the only direct cardiac test that you can probably do in your office, Yawn added, and if a patient presents during an acute episode, you might do an ECG to see if there are changes in the T-wave and other patterns.

Neil Skolnik, MD

In contrast, if heart failure is suspected, the classic test to order is an echocardiogram. “But that’s going to take scheduling and time to get. You’re not going to get that on the day you’re trying to make the differential diagnosis,” Pace said.

Demographics like age, comorbidities, specific symptoms, and a physical exam can also guide testing.

Skolnik said, “For example, pulmonary function tests like spirometry are very helpful in gaining insight as to whether someone has active respiratory disease.”

Go With the Pro

Diagnosing pulmonary disorders includes ruling heart failure in or out. A useful assay is an N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) test. If the NT-ProBNP is elevated in the blood, the next logical step is an echocardiogram to look at heart function. “If there is heart failure, you want to distinguish if it is heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction,” Skolnik said.

Pace cautioned that NT-ProBNP can also be elevated in COPD, but it typically goes much higher in heart failure. “There is a whole bunch of ancillary tests, but probably the critical ones are the NT-ProBNP level, a chest x-ray, and an echocardiogram, which are probably the most helpful for differentiating things,” he added.

What Is the Situation on Spirometry?

Spirometry, unfortunately, rarely gets done, Kaplan said. Spirometry is a lung function test that can distinguish restrictive conditions — like fibrosis, sarcoidosis, or obesity-related lung restriction — from obstructive lung diseases — such as COPD, asthma, or emphysema. The test remains underutilized around the world, including in the United States, in part because some providers are uncomfortable interpreting the results or because it is just not available.

“ We know that, unfortunately, a lot of primary care clinics had spirometry removed during COVID — and it never got put back in,” Yawn said. Patients are asked to breathe heavily in and out during the test, and uncertainty arose about the filters blocking transmission of the COVID virus. As a result, many PCPs have to refer patients to a pulmonary lab or to a pulmonologist or allergist to access spirometry.

Despite the widely accepted value of spirometry, testing a patient before and after they use a bronchodilator can take 30 minutes. “And that is 30 minutes of a technician’s time at a primary care office, probably my nurse or my medical assistant. That can really throw my whole schedule off, and so it is not easy to incorporate.”

Pace disagreed with Yawn about the value of performing spirometry in a primary care setting. “Somebody can prove me wrong, but when a patient is having an acute problem, you will see slightly different changes, but lungs full of water from heart failure are not going to have normal spirometry either. When you have people that have all kinds of mucus, water, or anything else going on, then their usual respiratory pattern becomes hard to interpret.”

“From my perspective, it’s a follow-up test like the echocardiogram, not an acute test like a chest x-ray or a blood test,” Pace added. But it does play a valuable role. “Once you get treatments initiated, if you think that there is a respiratory illness, then spirometry is the sine qua non. It is the diagnostic test for COPD. That is the test you need.”

“Spirometry absolutely has to be done,” Kaplan said. “You want to get an idea if someone’s lung volumes are large or small. You also want to get an idea of diffusion capacity.” Diffusion capacity is a measure of how well the lungs can transfer gases between the air and the blood.

A condition to watch for is not new but is being newly discussed, Yawn said. It’s called preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm). Patients with PRISm have the same symptoms as COPD, but they do not have obstructive pulmonary function test results.

“So we aren’t sure what to do with these people, but we see a lot of them in primary care because they are symptomatic,” Yawn said.

These patients may benefit from respiratory therapy and management, according to a study published in November 2024 in Pragmatic and Observational Research.

The Apple Watch Series 10 is an iterative upgrade. If you already have a Series 8 or 9, it's perhaps not worth switching to the latest model. However, if you're rocking an older Apple Watch or you're looking to pick up your first one, this is our recommendation. We gave the Apple Watch Series 10 a score of 90 in our review.

The Series 10 is a little thinner and lighter than the previous model, but it has a larger OLED screen, which makes it easier to see what's on the display. Apple has improved the efficiency of the battery life as well, and it should often last longer on a single charge than the 18 hours for which it's rated.

The new sleep apnea feature is very welcome, but the blood oxygen feature from older models is not available here (Apple removed that app from certain models in the US due to a patent dispute). In general, though, the Series 10 is a solid step forward for the Apple Watch. The latest model is a terrific fitness tracker that helps you keep an eye on the most important alerts and notifications you receive on your iPhone.

If you're looking to spend a bit less, the Apple Watch SE is also on sale for Memorial Day for $169.

Oppo Find X9 Ultra's camera configuration leaks,"The Oppo Find X8 Ultra only launched in April, and yet here we are a month later already talking about its successor, which is allegedly due to arrive in March of next year.

Still, we must, since a new leak today brings us purported details about the Find X9 Ultra's camera setup. The phone will allegedly come with a 200 MP main camera, a 50 MP ultrawide, and a pair of periscope telephoto cameras - 200 MP and 50 MP.

Oppo Find X8 Ultra

So Oppo is keeping the quad-camera design of the Find X8 Ultra, but changing things around rather significantly with a new, higher-res main camera, and a new, higher-res telephoto for the closer range of zooming. This one will also pull double-duty as a macro shooter.

For comparison, note that the Find X8 Ultra has four 50 MP cameras on its back. The Find X9 Ultra will be powered by Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 chipset. According to past rumors, the Find X9 Ultra has a 6.82-inch flat OLED screen with ""2K+"" resolution and 120 Hz refresh rate, and will launch running ColorOS 16 based on Android 16. Oppo's ColorOS 16 will be unveiled at some point between July and September.

Google Home kicks off a Gemini-backed 'Voice Assistant' test for Android,"What you need to know

Google Home's app on Android is slowly receiving a Public Preview test called ""Voice Assistant.""

This test is reportedly giving users more control over who can use Google's experimental AI (Gemini) feature on their smart home devices.

Gemini appeared in a test for Nest devices last December; however, I/O 2025 held even more in store for Home, like better AI-created automations and more.

Google's reportedly dropped a new experiment for its Home app testers that brings a little more for its AI helper.

The folks at 9to5Google noticed the beginning of a new ""voice assistant"" experiment under the Public Preview for Google Home. This test concerns how others (in your home) can interact with the available/enrolled experiments that Google has to offer for your smart devices. According to the post, the test description states users can ""Choose how people can access Assistant experiments on all eligible devices in this home.""

Users can open Google's experiments to every smart home device connected.

However, despite the experimental availability to every device, that doesn't mean every person can use them. Google gives users two choices here: Everyone or Require Voice Match. The former opens the floodgates for anyone in the home to speak aloud to Gemini's influence in Google Home for assistance via the Public Preview experiments.

The latter restricts access to those who've set up ""Voice Match"" in Google Home.

The publication states this option has appeared on Android for now under the Google Assistant with help from Gemini"" section of the Public Preview.

It's no surprise that Gemini's been taking over the Assistant's real estate in recent history, and Google Home is no exception. In December, Gemini hit the Public Preview for a test regarding Nest devices. Those in the Public Preview with a Nest Audio or Nest Mini (2nd gen) speaker could call on Gemini for Ai-powered answers. These were delivered via the old Assistant; however, it's Gemini's brains in the background that make this possible.

Google stated the AI's LLM (large language model) delivers more ""in-depth"" answers for users, covering a range of general topics. Follow-up questions after receiving an answer were possible in this test.

More recently, I/O 2025 had a little in store for Google Home after the main attractions. The company detailed a ""summaries"" test en route for its Pixels. The ""Home Summary"" widget would give users bite-sized notifications on their lock screen about what's transpired at home, like delivered packages and more. Additionally, the company reiterated its previous ""help me create"" test in the Home app.

Google is advancing that feature, giving users more automation starters such as triggers that are dependent on the weather and dates.",https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-voice-assistant-test-android,Technology

"Seagate’s 24TB External Hard Drive Is Mega Memory at a Mini Price, Memorial Day Deal Only","Remember when the first terabyte-sized external hard drives hit the market and blew everyone’s minds with how huge they were? How quaint. They were also as ginormously expensive as we thought their capacity was.

Fast forward to current times, and there’s a 24TB drive from storage giant Seagate available at Amazon for just $280, which is a considerably lower per-terabyte price than those 1TB drives of old. The Seagate Expansion 24TB External Hard Drive is smaller, faster, and more reliable, and it works equally well with PC and Mac computers.

See at Amazon

So Much Storage

The Seagate Expansion 24TB External Hard Drive isn’t pocket-sized, but at just 3 inches tall and a bit under 3 pounds, it is most definitely portable. The day will almost certainly come when there are pocket-sized 24TB drives, but until then, this is about as compact as they come.

The USB 3.0 interface of the Seagate lets you move data on or off the drive at a blistering-fast 4800 MB/s, which you’ll be more than thankful for if you’re doing a full-computer backup for the first time, or getting everything off one machine to move onto a new one. Creators and photo and video enthusiasts will deeply appreciate the enormous 24TB capacity of the drive, as well as the speed with which it writes those huge files.

See at Amazon

Backup for the Backup

The Seagate Expansion 24TB External Hard Drive is pure plug-and-play, able to come out of the box and immediately become your trusted backup drive. Mac users will have to reformat the drive in order to use it with Apple’s time Machine, but that’s an exceptionally easy and fast procedure.

Seagate external hard drives have a well-earned reputation for reliability, and the 250,000-plus Amazon reviewers who give this model an average 4.6 star review are solid proof. But, as they say, things happen, and in that event Seagate’s Rescue Data Services are at the ready. This service is included in the price of the drive, and should your hard drive become corrupted or suffer physical damage, you can ship it to Seagate and their expert techs will either repair the drive or salvage the data and move it onto a new device to send back to you.

You might be surprised at just how many files you have to back up, or maybe you have several smaller backup drives lying around and you’re looking for a way to consolidate them. The Seagate Expansion 24TB External Hard Drive is a perfect solution, and the $280 price running right now at Amazon is unbeatable.

Exynos 2500 powered Galaxy Z Flip 7 disappoints in inaugural Geekbench run,"The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has shown up on Geekbench. It will be the first of its kind to skip a Snapdragon SoC and use an Exynos 2500 in its place.

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

Shortly after the Galaxy Z Flip FE showed up on Geekbench powered by an Exynos 2400, the mainstream Galaxy Z Flip 7 has followed suit, this time with a newer Exynos 2500 at the helm. However, its performance is a bit of a damp squib, even when compared to a past version of the Exynos 2500.

The Galaxy Z Flip 6 (SM-F766U) scores 2,012 and 7,563 points in Geekbench 6.4's single and multicore tests, respectively. Last year, the same chip scored 2,359 and 8,141 points in the same benchmark, but it was tested on a Galaxy S25+ prototype. Then again, both chips are engineering samples and will not perform as well as they can with proper software support.

The above Geekbench listing tacitly confirms the Samsung has likely compromised on performance to get better yields out of its 3 nm node. The new Exynos 2500 variant fell behind the original by 14% in single core and 7% in multicore. These lacklustre scores further widen the divide between Exynos and Snapdragon/MediaTek.

Interestingly, the Exynos 2500 sample tested alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has the same CPU specs as its earlier iteration. It has one prime core at 3.3 GHz, two P-cores at 2.75 GHz, five P-cores at 2.36 GHz and two E-cores at 1.80 GHz. These are all last-gen Arm v8 cores.

This variant has 12 GB of RAM and a Xclipse 950 GPU. Disappointing performance aside, the main concern will be power efficiency because the Flip 7's rumoured battery upgrade might not matter if the underlying SoC squanders the extra capacity.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/Exynos-2500-powered-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-disappoints-in-inaugural-Geekbench-run.1024321.0.html,Technology
Euro hits one-month high after Trump delays EU tariffs,"The euro climbs to a one-month high against the U.S. dollar on Monday after President Donald Trump postpones threatened 50% tariffs on European Union goods, easing investor concerns over a potential trade conflict.

The euro touches $1.1418, its strongest level since April 29, before settling at $1.1375. Sterling also gains, rising to its highest level since February 2022 at $1.356.

The dollar weakens across multiple currencies, including the yen and Swiss franc, as traders react to recent U.S. policy shifts and fiscal developments. The greenback slips in part due to investor uncertainty over the administration’s tax and spending plans, which could significantly increase federal debt over the next decade.

Trump’s decision to delay the EU tariff hike follows a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who requested more time to negotiate a trade agreement. The new deadline is set for July 9, marking the end of a 90-day pause on tariffs first announced in early April.

The European Central Bank signals that the euro may grow in global influence if the bloc strengthens its financial and security institutions. ECB President Christine Lagarde says the current environment presents an opportunity for a “global euro moment.”

Improved investor sentiment leads to modest losses in safe-haven currencies. The dollar rises 0.2% against the yen to 142.84 and holds steady against the Swiss franc at 0.821 francs.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/26/euro-hits-one-month-high-after-trump-delays-eu-tariffs/,Business

Goldman Sachs Expects Stronger Yuan to Boost Chinese Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks are expected to benefit from further gains in the yuan, which has been showing resilience amid the country’s trade spat with the US, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Every 1% appreciation of the yuan versus the dollar can boost Chinese equities by 3% thanks to factors including improved corporate earnings outlook and stronger foreign inflows, strategists including Kinger Lau wrote in a note Monday. Earlier this month, the bank raised its 12-month forecast for the yuan to 7 per dollar, from 7.35.

“Chinese stocks tend to perform well when the currency rises,” Lau and his colleagues wrote. The outlook for the currency lends support to their “overweight stance” on Chinese stocks, the strategists said, adding that consumer discretionary, property and broker stocks typically outperform under a strengthening yuan.

The MSCI China Index has recouped its losses since President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariff offensive, with a three-month trade truce with the US helping the market’s rebound. Chinese assets overall have benefited from a diversification away from US markets as concerns about Trump’s tariffs and tax cuts sustain the “sell America” narrative.

While investors continue to doubt the allure of US stocks and the dollar, the People’s Bank of China has sought to keep the yuan stable and add support to the economy via interest-rate cuts.

Market volatility from tariff uncertainties has caused Goldman strategists to revise their targets for Chinese stocks with notable frequency. They reduced their MSCI China projection twice in April, before raising it back in May as the US and China agreed to temporarily roll back tariffs.

The MSCI gauge and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell more than 1% each on Monday. That’s after capping six straight weeks of gains.

The onshore yuan has gained around 1.4% versus the greenback in May, and reached 7.1674 on Monday, its strongest level since November.

On Monday, the PBOC strengthened the yuan’s reference rate by the most since January amid the greenback’s extended slide. The official fixing of 7.1833 per dollar was still weaker than the yuan’s spot price, suggesting China is managing volatility and seeking to avoid a sharp appreciation like that seen in the Taiwanese dollar.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-expects-stronger-yuan-035654317.html,Business

"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to Launch Cheaper Blackwell AI Chip for China, Says Report","NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to launch a new AI chipset for China amid U.S. export curbs, Reuters reported on Saturday, with mass production likely to begin as early as next month.

The GPU will be part of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s Blackwell-architecture AI processors. It is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, significantly lower than the recently restricted H20 model.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to Launch Cheaper Blackwell AI Chip for China, Says Report

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.

The lower price reflects the GPU’s weaker specifications, which sources say will be based on RTX Pro 6000D and use GDDR7 memory in place of more advanced memory. They also added that it will not use TSMC’s advanced CoWoS packaging technology.

China is an attractive market for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The country accounted for nearly 13% of its sales last year. This is the third instance of the company having to tailor a GPU for the Chinese market due to restrictions from American authorities.

After the U.S. banned the H20 chip in April this year, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) considered manufacturing a downgraded version of the chip for China, but the plan did not work out.

Sources also told Reuters that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was planning to build another Blackwell AI chip for China, with production expected to begin in September. The company’s market share in China has declined since 2022 due to the U.S. export restrictions, resulting in an increasing number of Chinese customers turning toward Huawei's chips.

Summary BOJ's conference to debate IMF paper on 'inflation scares'

Rate control, quantitative tightening also up for debate

Central banks face challenge of balancing growth, price risks

TOKYO, May 26 (Reuters) - It's Japan's version of the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium , without the trail hikes or views, and this year's gathering of global central bankers in Tokyo will focus on two uncomfortable realities: flagging economic growth and sticky inflation.

The Bank of Japan and its affiliated think tank host a two-day annual conference that kicks off on Tuesday and includes prominent U.S., European and Asian academics and central bankers.

Sign up here.

While most of the speeches are academic in nature and closed to media, this year's theme looks at ""New challenges for monetary policy"", specifically how central banks should deal with persistent inflation, downside economic risks, volatile markets and U.S. tariffs.

Those conflicting headwinds, much of it a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, are creating speedbumps for many central banks, regardless of whether they are raising and cutting interest rates.

The BOJ, for example, remains on track to continue raising interest rates and steadily taper its bond purchases, a stark contrast to its rate cutting peers, but recent global developments have raised questions about the pace of such moves.

""While the BOJ may be forced to stand pat for a while, it doesn't need to ditch rate hikes altogether,"" said former BOJ official Nobuyasu Atago. ""It just needs to communicate in a way that when the environment looks right, it can resume rate hikes.""

Officials from the Federal Reserve, including New York Fed President John Williams, European Central Bank, Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of Australia are among participants of the conference, which takes place at the BOJ's headquarters in central Tokyo.

At last year's meeting, participants took stock of their experience battling economic downturns by discussing lessons learned from using various unconventional monetary easing tools.

They also discussed whether Japan - an outlier that kept interest rates ultra-low even as other major central banks hiked aggressively - could emerge from decades of deflation and low inflation with budding signs of sustained wage hikes.

While concerns this year centre on tariff-induced economic downturns, the conference's session topics indicate policymakers still sensitive to risks of being caught with persistent, too-high inflation.

One session features ""reserve demand, interest rate control, and quantitative tightening."" Another will debate a paper published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December titled ""Monetary Policy and Inflation Scares.""

That paper explains how large supply shocks, such as one caused by the COVID pandemic, can lead to persistent inflation, warning of the dangers central banks face assuming that they can look through cost-push price pressures.

ERRATIC POLICY

That could be a compelling message for major central banks that face a similar dilemma exacerbated by a global trade war and Trump's erratic trade policy.

Initially thought to be on course for more rate cuts, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been forced into a waiting game with officials warning last week of creeping inflation due to tariffs.

While the European Central Bank is expected to cut rates again in June, the case is growing for a pause beyond that as inflation challenges creep up on the horizon, according to Reuters' conversations with policymakers.

""Tariffs may be disinflationary in the short run but pose upside risks over the medium term,"" ECB board member Isabel Schnabel, an outspoken policy hawk, told a conference at Stanford University on May 9, in an explicit call for a pause.

The BOJ, too, faces the challenge of balancing domestic inflationary pressure and growth risks from U.S. tariffs.

Trump tariffs forced the BOJ to sharply cut its growth forecasts on May 1 , signaling a pause in its rate-hike cycle that still leaves short-term interest rates at a meagre 0.5%.

And yet, Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled readiness to resume rate hikes if underlying inflation stays on course to durably hit its 2% target.

Japan's core consumer inflation hit a more than two-year high of 3.5% in April as food prices surged 7% in a sign of the pain rising living costs are inflicting on households.

""It's clear the BOJ has failed to achieve its mandate of price stability,"" said Atago, who is currently chief economist at Rakuten Securities Economic Research Institute.

""Inflation will always be among worries for the BOJ, which is probably already behind the curve in dealing with domestic price pressures.""

Ueda delivers a keynote speech at the outset of the conference on Tuesday, followed by a lecture by Agustin Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

Summary RBI proposes rupee lending overseas in select neighbouring nations

Government wants to increase rupee liquidity in trade transactions

Allowing rupee loans abroad would promote use of international use of currency

NEW DELHI, May 26 (Reuters) - India's central bank is taking another step to internationalise the rupee, seeking approval to allow domestic banks to lend the currency to overseas borrowers for the first time, two sources said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked the federal government to allow domestic banks and their foreign branches to lend Indian rupees to overseas borrowers to enhance the use and acceptability of the local currency in trade.

Sign up here.

The proposal, which was sent to the finance ministry last month, suggests lending in rupees to non-residents can begin in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the sources said.

If successful, such rupee-denominated lending could be extended to cross-border transactions globally, one of the sources said.

According to Ministry of Commerce data, 90% of India's exports to South Asia were to these four nations in 2024/25, amounting to nearly $25 billion.

Currently, foreign branches of Indian banks are restricted to providing loans in foreign currencies and such loans are extended mainly to Indian firms.

The sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential. Emails sent to the Finance Ministry and the RBI requesting comment did not receive a response.

The central bank has been taking steps to increase the use of the local currency in global trade and investment.

As part of the strategy, RBI recently permitted the opening of rupee accounts for non-residents outside India.

Earlier this month, Reuters reported the RBI has sought government's approval to remove the cap on foreign banks with so-called vostro accounts buying short-term sovereign debt, to boost rupee-denominated investment and trade.

The RBI will open the foreign loans in rupees only for the purpose of trade, the sources said.

Currently, rupee liquidity is provided in other countries only through a limited number of government-backed credit lines or bilateral currency swap arrangements.

""The objective is to reduce dependence on such arrangements and instead allow commercial banks to provide rupee liquidity on market terms,"" the first source said, citing a communication from the central bank in April.

The second source said enabling easier access to rupee-denominated loans will help facilitate trade settlements in rupees and reduce exposure to foreign exchange volatility.

The government has received several requests from financial institutions to support strategic projects through rupee-denominated financing, the second source said.

India's experience with local currency pacts with the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and the Maldives, as well as Special Rupee Vostro Accounts used for trade with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, has underscored the need to deepen the availability of rupee liquidity, the source said.

If implemented, the policy would mark a major step toward integrating the rupee into the global financial system, positioning it as a more widely accepted currency for international trade and investment, the second source added.

China Focus: Scientists develop insect-inspired vision system with AI capabilities,"BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have recently made a major breakthrough in the field of bionic vision, paving a new path for microscopic observation and high-end instrument development.

The study, a collaboration between the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology and Duke University in the United States, was published in the journal Science Advances on Thursday.

Inspired by insect compound eyes, scientists have previously developed various imaging systems using microlens arrays and sensors, achieving initial applications.

However, traditional bionic compound-eye systems have long faced limitations due to their complex 3D structures and restricted spatial resolution, resulting in blurry imaging.

""We aim not only to let bionic vision systems 'see' the world but also 'see clearly' and 'understand' it,"" said Zhang Dawei, a professor at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology and leader of the research team.

The innovative breakthrough stems from an in-depth bionic study of the structural characteristics and information-processing mechanisms of arthropod compound eyes.

Insects rely on hundreds or thousands of small visual units working together to respond instantly to complex environments. Mimicking this, the team developed a compact 0.8-cubic-centimeter bionic vision system capable of megapixel-level, full-color, ultra-wide-field (165°×360°) high-resolution imaging.

Using deep learning, the team built a multi-level visual processing model that performs tasks such as high-definition panoramic image reconstruction, wide-field multi-target positioning, object recognition, multi-target tracking, and 3D tracking.

This advancement enables bionic vision to truly ""see clearly and understand,"" overcoming traditional limitations.

Zhuang Songlin, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said the research exemplifies interdisciplinary innovation by merging bionics with AI.

The team is now refining the bionic compound-eye structure, focusing on applications in micro-unmanned platforms, endoscopic inspection instruments and other high-end equipment.

This achievement not only advances AI-powered scientific instruments but also supports advancements in medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring and intelligent security, demonstrating strong potential from fundamental research to industrial applications. ■",https://english.news.cn/20250525/2ab9f9c6d4fb42e5a4e63f83527e1cc2/c.html,Business
The Commodities Feed: All eyes on upcoming OPEC+ meeting,"The oil market is trading firmer this morning after President Trump said he would delay the deadline for tariffs on EU goods until 9 July. This is after announcing late last week that the US would impose 50% tariffs starting 1 June. The extension comes after a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Meanwhile, Russia stepped up its attacks on Ukraine, prompting Trump to say that he’s considering sanctions against Moscow, which could put Russian energy flows at risk.

The lower oil price environment continues to result in reduced drilling activity in the US. Baker Hughes data shows that active rigs fell by 8 last week to 465. This is the fourth consecutive week of declines, leaving the rig count at its lowest since November 2021. Frac spread count data from Primary Vision also shows a further slowdown in completion activity. The slowdown in activity is no surprise, considering West Texas Intermediate (WTI ) forward prices are averaging a little over $60/bbl for the remainder of this year. Also, calendar 2026 prices are averaging similar levels. The industry needs, on average, $65/bbl to drill a new well profitably, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve’s quarterly energy survey.

The latest positioning data shows that speculators increased their net long in ICE Brent by 12,185 lots over the last reporting week to 163,329 lots as of last Tuesday. This might be due to fading hopes of an Iranian nuclear deal. Positioning data shows that, while we saw some fresh longs entering the markets, with 21,892 lots of fresh buying, some speculators are selling the market. The gross short has increased by 9,707 lots.

We’re likely to hear lots of noise this week ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on Sunday, 1 June, where the group will decide on output policy for July. Last week, there were suggestions that the group is considering another sizable supply increase. We’re assuming in our balance sheet that the group will agree to increase output by another 411k b/d in July. This should keep the market well supplied over the second half of this year.",https://think.ing.com/articles/the-commodities-feed-opec-meets-later-this-week260525/,Business
A notable uptick: FPI inflows so far in May are the highest in 8 months,"Despite headwinds, such as cross-border tensions with Pakistan and elevated US bond yields, May has emerged as the best month for foreign portfolio investor (FPI) flows in eight months.

So far this month, FPIs have been net buyers of Rs 14,256 crore, the highest since September 2024.

The positive trend has been bolstered by the India-Pakistan ceasefire, prospects of a US trade deal, and a surge in block deals. Moreover, the US dollar's decline against global currencies has boosted foreign investments in emerging markets (EMs), with Taiwan and Brazil attracting more inflows than India.

FTO Gene Polymorphisms Influence Neuroblastoma Susceptibility in Chine,"Introduction

Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor that develops from the sympathetic nervous system.1,2 NB accounts for approximately 8% of all pediatric cancers.3 Furthermore, the prognosis of NB varies depending on the heterogeneity in age, clinical stage, genetic features, and biological characteristics.1,4,5 Additionally, patients diagnosed with neonatal NB and low-risk NB generally exhibit a more favorable prognosis,3,6 whereas those with high-risk NB commonly develop metastases and experience a rapid deterioration of their condition. The 5-year survival rate for patients with high-risk NB is less than 50%.7–9 Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapies for patients with NB.

With the progress of high-throughput “omics” techniques, several genes and molecules have undergone evaluation as potential targets for the treatment of NB. Additionally, certain genetic SNPs, such as the YTHDC1 gene polymorphism (rs3813832 T>C)10 and the hOGG1 gene polymorphism (rs1052133 G>C),11 have been linked to NB susceptibility. Nevertheless, our current understanding of the correlation between FTO SNPs and NB susceptibility remains limited. Notably, certain FTO SNPs situated within intron 1 of the FTO gene have demonstrated a significant influence on body mass and obesity in humans.12–14

In a recent study, the overexpression of FTO was discovered to play a critical role in acute myeloid leukemia as an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase. It was observed to promote cell proliferation and transformation while suppressing apoptosis.15 Furthermore, aberrant FTO overexpression was associated with the promotion of breast tumor progression,16 regulation melanoma tumorigenesis as a pro-tumorigenic factor,17 and the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, while also suppressing their apoptosis.18 Additionally, FTO knockdown led to a decrease in proliferation of N2a NB cells.19 Lin et al also reported that FTO overexpression could modulate energy homeostasis through the cAMP-response element binding protein signaling pathway in human NB cells.20

Considering the significance of FTO, we performed a case-control study to investigate the association between FTO polymorphisms and the risk of NB.

Materials and Methods

Study Population

This retrospective case-control study enrolled all unrelated patients of Chinese Han ethnicity with NB from eight medical centers in Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Wenzhou, Xi’an, Taiyuan, Kunming, Changsha, and Shenyang ( Table S1 ), following the same inclusion criteria. In addition, 1734 NB-free controls matched for age, sex, and ethnicity were recruited from the same geographical locations during the same period. The case group consisted of 898 patients who were diagnosed with NB based on precise diagnostic criteria using clinical and histopathological evidence and received treatment at these eight medical centers. The detailed inclusion criteria have been previously reported in our studies.21,22

Polymorphism Selection and Genotyping

Four potential FTO SNPs (rs1477196 G>A, rs9939609 T>A, rs7206790 C>G, rs8047395 A>G) were retrieved from the dbSNP database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP ) and the SNPinfo Web Server ( https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov ) based on our previous studies.22–24 The selection criteria were as follows: Firstly, SNPs are located in the 5’-flanking regions, 3’- and 5’- untranslated regions, and exons of the FTO gene. Moreover, the minor allele frequencies should be >5% in Chinese Han population; Furthermore, LDmatrix Tool ( https://ldlink.nih.gov ) result indicated that there was no significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) among each other (R2 < 0.8). As shown in the Figure S1 , there was no significant LD among these four SNPs of FTO (R2 = 0.064 between rs7206790 and rs8047395, R2 = 0.034 between rs7206790 and rs1477196, R2 = 0.536 between rs7206790 and rs9939609, R2 = 0.598 between rs8047395 and rs1477196, R2 = 0.089 between rs8047395 and rs9939609, and R2 = 0.06 between rs1477196 and rs9939609). Genomic DNA was then extracted from the patients’ peripheral blood using standard procedures, and the SNP types were determined using a commercial TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction kit.25,26 Additionally, approximately 10% of the DNA samples were randomly selected for re-genotyping using sequencing to ensure quality control and verify the accuracy of the results. The concordance between the two sets of results was 100%, demonstrating high reproducibility.

Statistical Analysis

The goodness-of-fit chi-square (χ²) test was conducted to assess whether the frequency distributions of the selected SNP genotypes adhered to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the control group. Two-sided χ²-tests were used to compare demographic variables and allele frequency distributions between NB patients and controls. The odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CIs), and adjusted P values for age and sex were calculated for each FTO SNP. Unconditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the strength of the association between the selected SNPs and NB susceptibility, providing ORs and 95% CIs. Furthermore, stratification analyses were conducted based on age, sex, original tumor location, and International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stages. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The detailed SAS running codes are provided in the supplementary materials (SAS Code 1 and SAS Code 2). Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.

Results

Correlations Between FTO SNPs and NB Susceptibility

A total of 888 patients with NB and 1733 controls were successfully genotyped. The genotype frequency distributions of the four FTO SNPs (rs1477196 G>A, rs9939609 T>A, rs7206790 C>G, rs8047395 A>G) in patients with NB and controls, along with their relevance to NB susceptibility are presented in Table 1. Additionally, the genotype frequencies of the four selected SNPs accorded with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls (HWE=0.466 for rs1477196 G>A, HWE=0.046 for rs9939609 T>A, HWE=0.022 for rs7206790 C>G, and HWE=0.657 for rs8047395 A>G). Consequently, no significant associations were observed between the selected FTO polymorphisms and the risk of NB in the single locus analysis (P adjusted for age and sex >0.05).

Table 1 Association Between FTO Gene Polymorphisms and Neuroblastoma Risk

To delve deeper into the relationship between FTO SNPs and NB susceptibility, the combined effect of risk genotypes was examined (Table 1). However, the findings from the combined analysis (P adjusted for age and sex >0.05) were identical to those of the single locus analysis.

Stratification Analysis

To further evaluate the association between the selected FTO polymorphisms and NB susceptibility among different subgroups, stratification analysis was conducted based on age, sex, site of origin, and INSS stage (Table 2). Single locus stratification analysis revealed no correlation between the rs7206790 C>G polymorphism and the risk of NB in any of the subgroups. However, among participants in the INSS stage III+IV subgroup, those with the GG genotype of rs8047395 A>G had a significantly higher susceptibility to NB compared to those with the AA/AG genotype (Adjusted OR=1.36, 95% CI=1.01–1.81, P=0.040). Furthermore, combined analysis indicated that the presence of 3–4 risk genotypes had a significantly correlation with NB originating in retroperitoneal (AOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.08–2.00, P=0.015) and NB in III+IV INSS stages (AOR=1.37, 95% CI=1.03–1.83, P=0.033) compared with the reference group.

Discussion

The FTO gene is situated on 16q12.2 and is responsible for producing the FTO protein, It has been reported FTO knockdown led to increased amounts of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA, whereas overexpression of FTO resulted in decreased amounts of m6A in vitro, which strongly suggested FTO plays a crucial role in the demethylation process of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) residues in nuclear RNA within human cells.27,28 Several studies have shown that m6A modification is associated with various aspects of tumor biology, including growth,29 proliferation,30 differentiation,31 invasion,32 and metastasis.33 Additionally, it has been observed that m6A can function both as a tumor stimulator and a tumor repressor.34,35 Owing to its oxidative demethylation function, the biological regulatory mechanism of FTO expression has been recently explored in various human malignancies, such as breast tumors,36 bladder tumors,37 prostate cancer,38 hepatocellular carcinoma,39 and non-small cell lung carcinoma.40 Furthermore, the impact of FTO SNPs on tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and cancer susceptibility has also been revealed.41 Gaudet et al concluded that the rs8050136 C>A FTO polymorphism did not have a significant impact on the risk of endometrial cancer in the Polish Endometrial Case-Control Study,42 and this finding was consistent with three replication studies conducted by the same authors.42 In a hospital-based case-control study by Tang et al,43 it was reported that the FTO SNPs rs8050136 C>A and rs9939609 T>A polymorphisms were significantly associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. This study included 1070 patients with pancreatic cancer and 1175 cancer-free controls.

There are many studies on the relationship between m6A modification and nervous system tumors, however, studies on FTO and nervous system tumors are limited. Cui et al confirmed that overexpression of FTO promoted glioblastoma stem cell-induced tumorigenesis as well as shortened the life-span of GSC-engrafted mice.44 This finding established a causative link between m6A modifications and glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. NB, as an embryonal tumor originating from the nervous system,45,46 has a high incidence rate among infants.47,48 Recently, the involvement of m6A modification in NB has been elucidated. Cheng et al proposed that miR-98 binds to the 3’-UTR of MYCN RNA and down-regulates its expression through m6A modification, thereby inhibiting NB progression.49 Wang et al reported that five m6A modification-related genes, namely METT14, WTAP, HNRNPC, YTHDF1 and IGF2BP2, could impact the clinical prognosis of NB.50 Zeng et al have confirmed the relationship between an SNP (rs3738067 A>G) of the m6A modification-related gene YTHDF2 and NB susceptibility.51 Several studies have reported the results of the correlation between FTO and NB, most of which revealed the role of FTO in human neuroblastoma cells, such as SH-SY5Y cells and SK-N-SH cells. Hu et al reported that Early B Cell Factor 3 (EBF3), a member of the highly evolutionarily conserved EBF-transcription factor family, whose m6A methylation modification level and mRNA half-life were upregulated by FTO siRNA, and EBF3 overexpression suppressed apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells.52 In N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium treated SH-SY5Y cells, FTO impaired the NRF2 mRNA stability via m6 A-dependent pathway to led to the ferroptosis significantly upregulated.53 And FTO increased NRF2 expression by mediating m6A demethylation of NRF2 mRNA, thereby inhibiting oxidative stress response in glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced SH-SY5Y cells.54 Lin et al have confirmed FTO interacted with CaMKII and modulated the activity of CREB signaling pathway in SK-N-SH cells, and the CREB signaling pathway could regulate food intake and energy homeostasis.20 Moreover, Lin et al have demonstrated FTO overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, whereas FTO knockdown promoted cell proliferation in NB cells, and the sensitivity of NB cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (etoposide and paclitaxel) is contributed to FTO expression level.55 Those study mentioned above showed that FTO expression was correlated with survival probability and prognostic factors in patients with NB. Consequently, it is reasonable to hypothesize that FTO SNPs may influence one or more pathological processes involved in the occurrence, progression, deterioration, or metastasis of NB. Limited studies have demonstrated the association between FTO SNPs and the susceptibility, tumorigenesis, and progression of pediatric NB. Nevertheless, this hospital-based case-control study represents the first attempt, to our knowledge, to assess the impact of FTO SNPs on NB susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. Our findings indicate that the selected FTO polymorphisms did not show a significant correlation with NB susceptibility overall. However, in the stratification analysis of FTO rs8047395 A>G, we observed that patients with a GG genotype in the stage III+IV subgroup were considered to have a higher risk of NB, therefore the results of our study may contribute to the effective health risk assessment of possible NB patients.

Our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the study population may not be entirely representative of the entire Chinese population, despite being the largest case-control study conducted to evaluate the association between FTO SNPs and NB susceptibility specifically in the Chinese Han population. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm and validate our findings. Additionally, the low incidence rate of NB poses challenges in conducting studies with small sample sizes, which may introduce some degree of bias. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that tumor susceptibility is influenced by a complex interplay between genetic risk factors and environmental factors.56 Furthermore, we did not evaluate important environmental factors, such as dietary habits, physical fitness, and childhood exposures, which could have a profound effect on the statistical analysis outcomes. Additionally, our study only focused on four specific FTO SNPs, limiting our ability to elucidate the role of all FTO polymorphisms in NB. Therefore, it is essential to identify potentially functional FTO polymorphisms to establish comprehensive associations between other FTO SNPs and NB susceptibility. Ultimately, mechanistic research and functional analysis will be fundamental approaches to confirm and clarify the underlying mechanisms linking FTO polymorphisms to NB susceptibility.

In summary, our study did not identify any remarkable associations between the selected FTO polymorphisms and NB susceptibility. However, our findings lay the groundwork for future research exploring the role of FTO SNPs in NB. Given the clinical significance of the relationship between FTO SNPs and NB susceptibility, larger-scale mechanistic studies are warranted to deepen our understanding and improve the treatment of NB.",https://www.dovepress.com/associations-between-fto-polymorphisms-and-neuroblastoma-risk-in-chine-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-PGPM,Business
Japan flight diverted to Seattle after man tried opening door mid-air,"Japan flight made emergency landing after man tried opening door

Police said the man was restrained by other passengers and flight crew

The man, who was not identified, was ""having a medical crisis"" and had to be restrained by other passengers and flight crew, police said.

Port of Seattle police told media they had been notified of a man who ""attempted to open exit doors during the flight"".

All Nippon Airways (ANA) Flight 114 was diverted to Seattle hours after taking off on Saturday ""due to an unruly passenger"", the airline said.

A Japanese plane headed from Tokyo to Texas had to make an emergency landing after a passenger tried to open one of its doors during the flight.

He was later taken to a hospital. It is unclear if he will face any charges.

""The safety of our passengers and crew are our top priority and we applaud the efforts of local law enforcement for their support,"" ANA said in a statement.

While the plane was waiting on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, a second person was removed from the flight for ""unruly behaviour"", authorities said.

Flight data shows that the plane made it to its destination, George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, on Saturday around 12:40 local time (17:40 GMT) - four hours after its scheduled arrival time.

This is the latest in a string of similar incidents.

In April, a Jetstar flight from Bali, Indonesia was forced to turn around during its journey to Melbourne, Australia, after a passenger similarly tried to open a plane door in the air.

Last November, a man who tried to open the plane door during an American Airlines flight was restrained and tied up by fellow passengers with duct tape.

And in November 2023, nine passengers of an Asiana Airlines flight were sent to hospital with breathing difficulties after a man successfully opened the aircraft's emergency exit door prior to it landing at a South Korean airport.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmjzlj0g30o,Business
China's BYD sees shares plunge 8% as EV maker cuts prices,"FILE PHOTO: The company logo of China's automaker BYD is seen on a car outside its headquarters in China's southern city of Shenzhen.

Shares in BYD plunged as much as 8.25% Monday, a steep drop from their record high last week, as investors assessed the Chinese electric vehicle giant's price cuts on May 23.

The company announced on the Chinese social media platform Weibo that it was reducing the prices on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June.

For instance, the price tag of the Seagull hatchback was reduced by 20% to 55,800 Chinese yuan ($7,780), while that of the Seal dual-motor hybrid sedan was cut by 34% to 102,800 yuan.

The latest developments follow other price revisions the automaker announced earlier in the year, such as the release of its Han sedans and Tang SUVs at a starting price that was 10.35% and 14.3% lower than that of previous versions.

Analysts from Citi expect BYD's price reduction to have caused a 30% to 40% spike in footfall at its dealership stores between May 24 and 25, compared to the previous weekend.

Shares of other Chinese automakers also declined on Monday as investors turned cautious about stiffer competition and a potential price war in the sector.

Shares in Geely Automobile were last seen trading 7.29% lower, while Great Wall Motor Co and Li Auto had lost 2.94% and 4.93% respectively. Meanwhile, shares in Xpeng were down 4.19%.

Looking ahead, Citi's analysts are not concerned that BYD's price cuts would erode its competitors' market share.

Instead, they expect ""robust sales growth"" for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan as ""competition remains relatively mild,"" the analysts wrote in a May 26 note.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/26/chinas-byd-sees-shares-plunge-8percent-as-ev-maker-cuts-prices.html,Business

Winemakers finding Trump's tariffs hard to swallow,"Winemakers finding Trump's tariffs hard to swallow

BBC Burgundy in eastern France is highly praised for the quality of its wine

Burgundy is one of the most prestigious wine regions in France, and the US is its biggest export market. But now Donald Trump's tariffs are threatening to price European wine out of the American marketplace. Crouched in cold mud under a thin Spring rain, vineyard employee Élodie Bonet snaps off unwanted vine shoots with her fingers and pruning clippers. ""We want the vine to put all its energy into the shoots that have the flowers where the grapes are going to grow,"" she explains. I leave Élodie working her way down the rows of vines, and walk up to the house and winery in the Burgundy village of Morey-Saint-Denis, where I meet owner and winemaker Cécile Tremblay. She takes me down to her cellar to taste some of her prized red wines, standing among the oak barrels and old bottles with labels weathered by mould and age. They have names on them that make wine lovers go weak at the knees - Nuits-Saint-Georges, Echezeaux, Vosne-Romanée, Clos-Vougeot, and Chapelle-Chambertin.

Ms Tremblay sells over half of her wine abroad, under the name Domaine Cecile Tremblay. ""For the United States, it's around 10% of the production; it's a big production for me!"" she says. After threatening a 200% mark-up on alcohol from Europe, Donald Trump imposed a 20% tariff on practically all European Union products on 5 April. Four days later, he lowered this to 10%, with the threat that he'd hike it back up again to 20% in July, depending on how trade negotiations pan out. And now Trump is threatening a future tariff of 50% on all goods from the EU. I ask Ms Tremblay if she's worried. ""Yes, sure,"" she says, ""As everybody is."" But that is all she will say on the matter. French winemakers are walking on eggshells at the moment, fearful of saying anything that might aggravate the situation.

Winemaker Cecile Tremblay says that Trump's tariffs are worrying, but she was reluctant to say more

Perhaps their representatives will be more forthcoming? I get in my car and drive over to one of her neighbours - François Labet. He is the president of the Burgundy Wine Board, which represents this region's 3,500 winemakers. ""The US is the largest export market for the whole region. Definitely,"" he tells me. ""They are the biggest in volume and the biggest in value."" And, until Donald Trump's re-election, the US market was booming. While French wines and spirits global exports fell 4% last year overall, sales of Burgundy wines to the US rose sharply. In volume terms, there were up 16% from 2024, to 20.9 million bottles. This was worth €370m ($415m; £312m) in revenues, 26.2% higher than in 2023. Mr Labet says the US accounted for about a quarter of Burgundy's wine exports last year. Burgundy's reputation abroad is mainly for its red wines, which are made from the celebrated pinot noir grape. Indeed, in the English-speaking world, burgundy is not so much a wine as a colour. The French word for the same colour is bordeaux; showing they know more about their wine, because while Bordeaux wines are mostly red, two-thirds of Burgundy is actually white. These are predominantly made from the chardonnay grape. Chablis, one of the best-known examples, is extremely popular in the US. Burgundy also produces an increasingly successful sparkling wine, called Crémant de Bourgogne, and a small amount of rosé. All of which is good for Burgundy because while general red wine consumption just keeps going down, white is holding firm, and sparkling is going up. Also, the reds that come out of Burgundy are, according to Mr Labet, the kind consumers increasingly want, as they are typically lighter than New World reds. ""What is interesting to see is that there is a strong de-consumption of what we call the big reds, made in the US. Wines with a lot of alcohol, aged in new wood."" Less sun and lower temperatures in Burgundy, even with climate change, means less sugar in the grapes and lower alcohol content.

Mr Labet remembers when, for 18 months of his first presidency, Donald Trump hit European wine with a 25% import tariff during a dispute over airlines. ""We were hostages of that situation, and it really did affect our sales to the US. We had a drop of about 50% of our exports to the US."" Regarding the current 10% Trump tariff, he predicts that French wine producers and US merchants will split the cost of the new import duty between them in order to maintain sales. But what will be the impact if in July Trump does decide to increase the tariff on all European Union exports to 20%, as he has threatened to do? ""We will go back to the 2019 situation where the market was almost stopped,"" says Mr Labet. For French wines in general, things could be even worse. ""When President Trump raised import duties by 25% for one-and-a-half years of his first mandate, we lost about $600m [£450m] very quickly,"" says Jerome Bauer, president of the French National Wines and Spirits Confederation. ""But back then Champagne wasn't included, and neither were wines stronger than 14 degrees of alcohol. So you can see the scale of the threat today."" The solution Mr Bauer is backing is free trade. No tariffs. But you'd expect him to say that, given that France and Europe run a big trade surplus with the US when it comes to wines and spirits.

Baccalaureate remarks by Chair Powell at the Princeton University Baccalaureate Ceremony,"Thank you, President Eisgruber, for the opportunity to speak here today. Congratulations to the Princeton University class of 2025 on the tremendous achievement of earning your degree, and to the parents, family members, friends, and mentors whose support and encouragement made this day possible.

Fifty years ago, almost to the day, I was sitting where you are now, listening to…a speaker…deliver a speech…neither of which I can recall. What I plan to do today is to share some things with you that I believe would have been useful for me to hear back then.

For those of you who are fundamentally unsure about your path, I was you. Rather than studying, I had spent my freshman year with fellow campus musicians playing my Martin D-35 acoustic guitar. It was a high school graduation present, one that my parents surely regretted.

While I still play that guitar, my freshman grades said clearly that I needed to get my act together academically, and by senior year I had done so. But I had no real plan for life after Princeton. I grew up in Washington, D.C., and majored in politics. As you know, Princeton graduates have a long and distinguished record of service to the nation and to humanity. That left me with a single thought, which was that I wanted to have a private sector career and also serve periodically in government. I was thinking of people like Princeton's George Shultz, a giant of that era. There are countless other examples across the political spectrum, including presidents, senators, members of Congress, governors, and judges. Of course, most of those who serve are not public figures. I could just as well point to classmates who devoted their working lives to teaching high school kids—there is no higher calling.

Many of my classmates and friends went straight into prestigious graduate schools, politics, or Wall Street. Others went on to global capitals, the military, or the Peace Corps. I had brushed off my parents' one academic suggestion, which was to major in economics, which struck me as boring and useless. After 13 years at the Fed, I admit I was wrong about that!

After graduation, I had no plan and no job, and wound up putting labels on shelves in a warehouse for six months. I didn't feel great about that. One of my closest friends was getting a master's at Stanford, and I could only think—""Nice going, Jay. You really nailed it."" In hindsight, that time in the warehouse was a blessing, and exactly what I needed. The next fall I entered law school, and for the first time I was highly resolved to make the most of the opportunity.

You know what? We all move at our own pace, and that's ok. Fifty years later I can tell you something I did not know then: The vast majority of what you need to know about work, about relationships, about yourself, about life, you have yet to learn. And that itself is a tremendous gift. Over the remainder of your life, you can—you must—continue to educate yourself and to grow as a person, becoming more focused on what really matters, more widely knowledgeable, better read, more disciplined, and more strategic. But also wiser, kinder, more empathetic, more generous, more loving, more forgiving of others and of yourself. Each of us is a work in progress. The possibilities for self-improvement are limitless.

Another thing I have realized is that while hard work, determination, and creativity matter a great deal to success in life, luck plays a big role too. All of us here are tremendously lucky. I know that, at a handful of critical times in my life, I got really lucky—beginning at birth.

My parents were well educated. They gave the six Powell kids a safe, loving home, and placed a high value on learning. They gave us everything we needed to thrive. That bit of luck led to the good luck I share with all of you, the chance to earn a degree from America's finest university.

Another thing I have learned along the way is that, as you strive in coming years to reach your full potential, you will need to take risks and make mistakes.

Everyone makes mistakes. Take it from an expert! But the bigger mistake is to avoid taking risks.

If you aren't failing from time to time, you aren't asking enough of yourself. Sooner than you think, many of you will be asked to assume leadership roles. It is very common to feel, as I once did, that you are not ready. Just know that almost no one is truly ready. All I can say is go for it! Throw yourself into the deep end of the pool. Believe in yourself. Take risks. When you fall down, get up! Repeat cycle. And as you do assume higher responsibility, understand that a big part of your job is to bring along the people behind you. Be the leader that people can learn from, the one that people want to work for.

My next point is closely related. A little bit of initiative, at the right time, can make all the difference. Initiative is the rocket fuel of life. I am no entrepreneur. I did not start a major tech company. But as I look back, many of the most important developments in my life trace back to a few occasions where I showed some initiative.

One example out of many—when I was a very junior associate, the man who ran my firm—Nicholas F. Brady—was a former U.S. senator whose career had spanned the private sector and public service. I wanted to meet him but realized that it was up to me to make that happen. One day I forced myself to walk up the stairs to his corner office. I asked for an audience and was ushered in. I was very nervous; the meeting was very brief; and I walked down those stairs thinking ""at least I tried."" To my surprise, two months later Nick Brady asked me to work on a project with him. A year or so after that he became the Secretary of the United States Treasury, and in time he asked me to serve under him as an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. That enormously challenging role whet my appetite for further public service and ultimately proved to be a gateway for my appointment to the Federal Reserve Board. If I had not forced myself to take that risky and potentially awkward step, I would not be here today.

I can think of long-term friendships and one marriage, my own, that turned on a moment's initiative. On occasions like that we risk failure, awkwardness, embarrassment, and rejection. But that's how we create the career opportunities, the great friendships, and the loves that make life worth living.

The combination of luck, the courage to make mistakes, and a little initiative can lead to much success. But know this: the world needs more from you than personal achievements and individual success. I strongly urge you to find time in your careers for public service.

Since the founding of this great democracy 250 years ago, generation upon generation have assumed the burden and the honor of moving us closer to the ideal that all are created equal. Now, it's your turn. I ask you to take a minute and realize how the quest for these values has led us to this point in our history. We lead the world in so many ways, including in scientific innovation and economic dynamism. Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset. Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted. When you look back in 50 years, you will want to know that you have done whatever it takes to preserve and strengthen our democracy, and bring us ever closer to the Founders' timeless ideals.

Those of you who are not entering the military or other public service may wonder, what is so great about public service? I'll give you a recent example. In my years at the Fed, the global economy has experienced a fair amount of turbulence, and one outright crisis—the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop. Critical financial markets were near collapse. The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder. Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ""We got this."" We took a range of aggressive measures to supply credit to the economy—many of them unprecedented—while the financial sector recovered. Others in government and the private sector did their part too. Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes. It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them. That's what public service is like.

With that luck that I mentioned comes great responsibility. You may recognize this from the Gospel of Luke: ""From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded.""

As you navigate the world of bright possibilities that awaits you, I urge you to take on the challenge and the opportunity to serve your fellow citizens. You will never regret that choice.

A very last, and critical point. Your life matters—to the people you love and to the broader world. Fifty years from now, you will want to be able to look in the mirror and know that you did what you thought was right, in every part of your life. At the end of the day, your integrity is all you have. Guard it carefully.

Thank you for your time. Congratulations to the Princeton class of 2025.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250525a.htm,Business

"Palestinian official says Hamas agrees to Gaza proposal, Israel dismisses it","CAIRO, May 26 (Reuters) - A Palestinian official said on Monday that Hamas has agreed to a proposal by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff for a Gaza ceasefire, only for an Israeli official to deny that the proposal was Washington's and add that no Israeli government could accept it.

Witkoff also rejected the notion that Hamas had accepted his offer for a hostage deal and a ceasefire in Gaza, telling Reuters that what he had seen was ""completely unacceptable"" and the proposal being discussed was not the same as his.

Sign up here.

The Palestinian official, who is close to Hamas, had told Reuters that the proposal would see the release of 10 hostages and a 70-day ceasefire and was received by Hamas through mediators.

""The proposal includes the release of 10 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in two groups in return for a 70-day ceasefire and a partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip,"" the source said.

It also included the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners by Israel, including hundreds serving lengthy prison terms.

An Israeli official dismissed the proposal, saying no responsible government could accept such an agreement and rejecting the assertion that the deal matched one proposed by Witkoff.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later said in a recorded message on social media he ""hoped very much"" he would be able to deliver developments on the subject of Israel's fight against Hamas and releasing the hostages, ""today and if not today then we will tomorrow"".

His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the video.

On March 18, Israel effectively ended a January ceasefire agreement with Hamas and renewed its military campaign in Gaza. Hamas and allied factions began firing rockets and attacks two days later.

Hamas has said it is willing to free all remaining hostages seized by its gunmen in attacks on communities in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and agree to a permanent ceasefire if Israel pulls out completely from Gaza.

Netanyahu has said Israel would only be willing to agree to a temporary ceasefire in return for the release of hostages, vowing that war can only end once Hamas is eradicated.

Israel launched an air and ground war in Gaza after the Hamas-led militants' cross-border attack, which killed 1,200 people by Israeli tallies, with 251 hostages abducted into Gaza.

The conflict has killed nearly 54,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, and devastated the coastal strip. Aid groups say signs of severe malnutrition are widespread.

"Saudi Arabia, Kuwait announce significant oil discovery in neutral zone","Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have announced a ""highly significant"" oil discovery in the neutral zone, marking a major breakthrough in energy exploration.

The discovery, located in the North Wafra Wara-Burgan field, boasts an output of more than 500 barrels per day. This marks the first major find since both nations resumed production in the region in 2020.

The discovery is seen as a positive development for both countries, reinforcing their status as key global energy suppliers.

The North Wafra field is located just five kilometers north of the existing Wafra field, and it represents an important step forward in oil exploration in the partitioned zone, which had been dormant for several years.

""This discovery is regarded as highly significant,"" said the Saudi Press Agency, citing its potential to enhance the two countries' standing in the global energy market.

Saudi Arabia and Kuwait Announce New Oil Discovery in the Partitioned Zone.https://t.co/RjQSwEVh8f#SPAGOV pic.twitter.com/6ws5D6Msnh — SPAENG (@Spa_Eng) May 26, 2025

The announcement follows a series of agreements between the two nations, with a 2019 agreement dividing up oil production in the neutral zone, which could eventually bring an additional 500,000 barrels per day into global supply.

The Wafra and Khafji oilfields in the neutral zone had halted production in 2014 and 2015, respectively, but resumed in mid-2020.

This new discovery demonstrates the continuing importance of the neutral zone to both nations' oil production capabilities.

The breakthrough comes amid growing concerns about global oil demand and supply pressures.

While prices have remained volatile, with Brent crude trading at $64.64 per barrel, the announcement of new reserves highlights Saudi Arabia and Kuwait's commitment to securing long-term energy supply and meeting global demand.

This discovery is part of a larger trend in the region, with Saudi Arabia's oil giant Aramco recently unveiling 14 new oil and gas fields, further bolstering the kingdom's position in the energy market.

The discoveries also coincide with significant finds in Kuwait, including a massive oil and gas discovery at the Al-Nokhatha field.

Despite the exciting news, the global oil market remains subject to volatility, particularly amid US tariff concerns and Opec+ production plans.

Oil prices have recently fluctuated, with projections indicating that Brent crude will hover between $63 to $65 per barrel for the remainder of the year.

This new discovery, however, gives Saudi Arabia and Kuwait an even stronger foothold in the international oil market as both countries look to solidify their energy futures.",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2547914/saudi-arabia-kuwait-announce-significant-oil-discovery-in-neutral-zone,World

Young girl escapes burning Gaza school after Israeli attack

At least 54 Palestinians have been killed - most of them in a school building sheltering displaced families - during Israeli air strikes on Gaza overnight, hospital directors have told the BBC. Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City was housing hundreds of people from Beit Lahia, currently under intense Israeli military assault. At least 35 were reported to have been killed when the school was hit. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence said multiple bodies, including those of children, were recovered – many severely burned, after fires engulfed two classrooms serving as living quarters. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted ""a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control centre"" there.

The IDF said the area was being used ""by the terrorists to plan... attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops"", and accused Hamas of using ""the Gazan population as human shields"". Video footage shared online showed large fires consuming parts of the school, with graphic images of severely burned victims, including children, and survivors suffering critical injuries. Faris Afana, Northern Gaza ambulance service manager, said he arrived at the scene with crews to find three classrooms ablaze. ""There were sleeping children and women in those classrooms,"" he said. ""Some of them were screaming but we couldn't rescue them due to the fires. ""I cannot describe what we saw due to how horrific it was."" Local reports said the head of investigations for the Hamas police in northern Gaza, Mohammad Al-Kasih, was among the dead, along with his wife and children. Separately, a strike on a house in Jabalia in northern Gaza killed 19 people, according to the director of al-Ahli hospital Dr Fadel el-Naim. The Israeli military has not yet commented on what was being targeted. The twin attacks are part of a broader Israeli offensive that has escalated in the northern part of the enclave over the past week. The IDF said it hit 200 targets across Gaza in 48 hours as it continued its operations against what it called ""terrorist organisations"". Meanwhile, a senior Hamas official told the BBC on Monday that the group had agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal offered by US special envoy Steve Witkoff. However, Witkoff told Reuters that what he had seen was ""completely unacceptable"" and that the proposal being discussed was not the same as his. A Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan agreed to by Hamas includes the release of 10 Israeli hostages held by the group in two phases. In exchange, there would be a 70-day truce, a gradual partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the release of an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners, including several hundred serving long or life sentences. The BBC has approached the Israeli government for comment on the proposal. Israeli media quoted anonymous Israeli officials as saying the plan would be rejected.

As mediation efforts continued, an Israeli strike on the home of a Palestinian doctor in Gaza killed nine of her 10 children on Friday. Dr Alaa al-Najjar's 11-year-old son was injured, along with her husband, Hamdi al-Najjar, who is in critical condition. The nine children - Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman and Sidra - were aged between just a few months old and 12. The Israeli military has said the incident is under review. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said two of its staff were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis the following day. The killing of Ibrahim Eid, a weapon contamination officer, and Ahmad Abu Hilal, a security guard at the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah ""points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza"", the ICRC said, repeating its call for a ceasefire.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9yjj54v3xo,World
"Amid calls for arms embargo, who supplies Israel's weapons? – DW – 05","Spain calls for arms embargo on Israel as Gaza violence escalates — but real pressure would require action from three major weapons exporters.

Spain has asked European countries to suspend arms shipments to Israel as international condemnation grows over its conduct in Gaza.

At a meeting of the ""Madrid Group"" hosted by the Spanish government, the host country's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an immediate suspension of Europe's cooperation deal with Israel.

He also called for an embargo on arms shipments.

""We must all agree on a joint arms embargo,"" said Albares prior to the conference. ""The last thing the Middle East needs right now is weapons.""

Among those at the meeting were representatives from Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Morocco and Brazil and several intergovernmental organizations.

However, only a fraction of the nations represented at the Madrid Group meeting actually supply Israel with armaments.

Israel is also one of the world's top exporters of armaments, so it has a powerful internal supply of weaponry as well.

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in March reported that Israel is the 15th biggest importer of arms globally, despite it being actively involved in conflict, accounting for less than two percent of global imports.

Its imports have also dropped by around 2.3% in the last five years, compared to the preceding period.

Crucially, three nations account for almost all of Israel's weapons supply: the United States, Germany and Italy.

United States is Israel's biggest arms supplier

By far, the US is the biggest arms supplier to Israel, both since the October 7 attacks and also historically.

Though its proportional supply has reduced over the last decade, it still accounted for about two-thirds of Israel's imports from 2020-2024, according to SIPRI.

This includes aircraft, armored vehicles and guided bombs.

Israel is also the top recipient of US aid historically, according to the US-based, nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

As well as a substantial economic contribution between 1946 and 2024, Israel has received $228 billion in military support from the US.

Today, most US foreign aid to Israel is military spending. This includes an existing agreement to provide $3.8 billion in support until 2028. Most aid provided by the US must be spent on the purchase of American military equipment and services, according to the CFR.

It's unlikely that the US will change its support for Israel. Attempts led by independent senator Bernie Sanders to withhold billions in military sales to Israel were rejected by the US Senate in both April 2025 and November 2024.

Germany will continue to provide Israel weapons

Germany is a long-time diplomatic and military supporter of Israel. From 2020-2024, Germany accounted for about a third of Israel's incoming arms supply, mostly naval frigates and torpedoes.

SIPRI researcher Zain Hussain told DW via email that ""Israel has relied on Germany for […] naval capabilities"" and that Israel has an incoming submarine order from Germany.

Germany's arms supply to Israel has also included armored vehicles, trucks, anti-tank weapons and ammunition.

And that is unlikely to change, despite Spain's calls for an embargo.

""As a country that understands Israel's security and existence as a core principle, Germany is always obliged to assist Israel,"" said German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul.

Those comments came as German chancellor Frederich Merz told public broadcaster WDR he ""no longer understands” Israel's objective in Gaza and that its actions could ""no longer be justified by a fight against Hamas.""

Despite his remark, any future restriction on Germay's arms supply would be a significant development. Germany provided more than €131 million ($137 million) in arms exports in 2024, according to government statistics. The figure in 2023 was €326 million.

Italy accounts for 1% of Israel's arms

Italy contributes around one percent of Israel's arms. But by Italian law, it is prohibited from doing so given the conflict.

The Italian government has been critical of Israel's actions, however reports last year found it continued to supply Israel following the commencement of hostilities in October 2023. That reportedly included €2.1 million ($2.4 million US) in the last quarter of 2023, during which Israel's offensive was under way. That was despite assurances from the Italian government that shipments had ceased.

Analysis performed on government accounts by Italian news outlet Altreconomia found Italy supplied €5.2 million in arms to Israel last year.

Some EU nations have reduced their exports

Israel has no shortage of armaments either produced domestically or through its major backers. Despite pressure from European nations to adopt an arms embargo, Hussain said the most effective block would requires Israel's primary armorers to join.

""The USA and Germany are the most important suppliers of major arms to Israel. For there to be maximum pressure on Israel's major arms capabilities, these states would have to be involved in an arms embargo,"" Hussain said.

Some European nations have either stopped the supply of weaponry, or have suspended export licenses. These include France, Spain and the UK, though their contributions are less than 0.1% of Israel's total intake. However, a study of UK trade data, cited by The Guardian in May, found that the country sent Israel thousands of military items despite export ban.

However for Germany to heed Spain's call, a major change in US foreign policy would be required, said Catherine Gegout, an international relations researcher at the University of Nottingham, UK.

""I think there would be much more pressure on Germany if the US changed as well,"" Gegout told DW. ""But I'm not sure the rest of the EU states [opposing arms] will be enough to change that special relationship with Israel.""

Despite Germany's long-standing commitment to Israel, Gegout said its ongoing weapons supply is becoming a problem for the European Union.

""I think it's a gigantic problem for the EU that Germany is sending so many weapons,"" Gegout said.

She said Spain's attempt to implement an arms embargo serves both a direct and symbolic purpose for countries that may oppose Israel's activities in Gaza.

Emmanuel Macron says video of wife pushing him shows them ‘joking around’,"Emmanuel Macron has denied he and his wife, Brigitte, had an altercation after a viral video promoted by Russian state media and French far-right accounts appeared to show her pushing him in the face as they prepared to get off a plane in Vietnam.

The video, shot by an Associated Press camera operator, shows the French president appearing in the doorway of the plane at the start of a visit to Hanoi. His wife’s hand appears to shove him, causing him to step back before recovering and waving.

Brigitte Macron’s body is not visible and her husband told reporters afterwards the gesture was playful. But the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, seized on the footage, writing on Telegram that the president had received “a right hook”.

“Did the first lady decide to cheer up her husband with a gentle pat on the cheek and miscalculated her strength?” she asked in a mocking post. “Did she want to fix his collar but ended up reaching the beloved face?” Zakharova added, after the Russia Today TV channel and associated social media accounts had repeatedly aired the clip. “Here’s a hint: maybe it was the ‘hand of the Kremlin’.”

Macron told reporters in Hanoi he and his wife were “joking around, as we do quite often”. An Élysée Palace official told French media the scene showed “a moment of closeness. But that was enough to feed the conspiracy theorists.”

Another Elysée source said the couple were “decompressing one last time before the start of the visit, larking around”. Macron “loves playing jokes like on his wife before official occasions, and she always responds like this … It wasn’t even a slap.”

Macron noted that other videos of him had been misinterpreted. People “have thought I shared a bag of cocaine, tussled with the Turkish president, now that I’m having a domestic dispute with my wife … None of this is true. Everyone needs to calm down,” he said.

Zakharova and the US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones this month wrongly accused Macron, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, of using drugs on a train to Kyiv, claiming a crumpled tissue was a bag of cocaine.

Macron told reporters in Hanoi the internet accounts making the claims were “familiar”, allying Russians with French extremists, adding that commentators had “explained this morning that my diplomacy was that of a battered husband”.

France and Vietnam on Monday signed deals on Airbus planes, defence and other pacts worth €9bn (£7.55bn) as the Macrons embarked on the first formal visit by a French presidential couple to the country’s former colony in nearly a decade.

The deals with Vietnam come amid trade turmoil prompted by Donald Trump’s US tariffs and cover the purchase of 20 Airbus planes, cooperation on nuclear energy, defence, rail and maritime transport, satellites and vaccines.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/macron-says-video-of-wife-brigitte-pushing-him-in-face-does-not-show-them-quarrelling,World
"Everyone is emotional, says Kremlin, after Trump calls Putin 'absolutely crazy'","Russia's powerful aerial campaign rages on in Ukraine

Oleh Chernysh

BBC News Ukrainian, reporting from Kyiv

Image source, Getty Images

It starts with the sound of gunfire in the middle of the night.

These are Ukrainian air defence forces firing heavy machine guns into the black sky, trying to hit a Russian drone.

They miss, and seconds later, you hear a loud roar - as if a jet is crashing down on your building. Another second passes, and you hear an explosion outside your window, followed by a bright flash.

This scene has played out not only before my eyes but also for tens of thousands of people in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine over the past three nights.

Since launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russia has carried out near nightly strikes on Ukraine. But those have intensified into powerful night-long aerial attacks in recent days. Since 23 May, it has deployed a record number of attack drones - particularly Shahed drones - as well as dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles.

For example, on the night of 26 May, Russia launched 9 missiles and 355 drones.

Ukraine claims it shot down nearly all of them. However, there are well-founded doubts about this.

First, the Russians have significantly upgraded the Shahed drones. Previously, they were slow, flew at low altitudes, and buzzed like an old moped. Now they are fast, roar like a jet, and can climb up to nearly 3km (1.85 miles) before striking their target.

All of this is intended to make it harder for Ukraine’s mobile fire teams to shoot them down with anti-aircraft guns. Moreover, there is information suggesting that Shaheds can now home in on targets without relying on satellite internet, which makes them harder to jam using electronic warfare systems.

Russia has also upgraded its ballistic missiles, according to Ukraine's Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat. He says the missiles now manoeuvre as they approach their targets and deploy decoys to evade air defence systems. As a result, even the latest US-made Patriot systems are finding it increasingly difficult to intercept them.

These developments come on top of Ukraine’s ongoing struggle with shortages of foreign air defence missiles, such as those for the SAMP/T and Patriot systems.

Now Kyiv must urgently work with its allies to find a way out of this difficult situation, as there are no signs that Moscow intends to stop its aerial terror campaign.

‘Nothing left to bomb’: Yemen’s civilians bear brunt of US airstrikes on Houthis,"Late last month, a suspected US airstrike levelled four homes on the fringes of the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, killing at least 11 people. A video posted by an eyewitness shows a frightened man carrying a young child on his back as they run through the darkness, warning people away, before the roar of a jet and the white flash of a blast.

Local people quickly circulated notifications of funerals for the many killed in the airstrike on the outlying Thaqban neighbourhood, listing the whole families that had died in an instant.

This included Ali Yahya Salah Masoud, who one mourner said on social media was killed “hand in hand with his entire family, including his wife, sons and daughters”, alongside pictures from a long-ago celebration showing his daughters with red bows in their hair and his smiling sons in small suit jackets.

Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in late April that a punishing campaign of US airstrikes that began in mid-March had “hit over 1,000 targets, killing Houthi fighters and leaders … and degrading their capabilities”.

Why are they bombing? The missiles are worth more than the buildings they’re hitting Mohamed Althaibani

While the US claims to have targeted the Houthis, the intense wave of airstrikes on major cities and sites across Yemen has also claimed dozens of civilian lives, according to human rights groups and the London-based monitoring organisation AirWars, which lists fatalities from three families in the attack on the Thaqban district.

“There’s nothing in this world, no matter how precious, that can replace my family,” said a 27-year-old mother of three, who said her parents and sisters were killed in the airstrike. “I feel like I die a hundred times a day from the grief.”

“We buried eight people from a single family, from a single house,” said a mourner at the funeral procession. “There’s no sign that this was a military target. We’re their neighbours … we saw what happened.”

Airwars cites several social media accounts which posted allegations that Yemen’s Houthi rebels used the Thaqban neighbourhood, including one Yemeni activist who posted on X that a home there contained a missile launch pad. All the posts were later deleted, and observers suggested that US forces had used the tweets to source information about where to target.

An official with US Central Command (Centcom), which oversees American military operations in Yemen, declined to comment on the airstrike on Thaqban, but said they were “aware of the claims of civilian casualties related to the US strikes in Yemen, and we take those claims very seriously. We are currently conducting our battle-damage assessment and inquiry into those claims.”

In a statement last month, Centcom also released figures different from Parnell’s, saying US forces had struck more than 800 targets, killing “hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders”, including senior drone and missile operatives, while also destroying swaths of the group’s facilities, air defences, weapons-manufacturing facilities and missiles.

It added: “These operations have been executed using detailed and comprehensive intelligence ensuring lethal effects against the Houthis while minimising risk to civilians.”

As waves of American airstrikes pounded the Yemeni capital, Mohamed Althaibani watched the walls of his house shake. The bombs that pummelled sites on the outskirts have often hit sites that the US, and before them a coalition led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia, has already struck repeatedly over their decade-long military campaign, he said.

“People here in Yemen are born into nothing, the government has nothing – so why are they bombing?” he asked. “There is nothing left to bomb. The missiles are worth more than the buildings they’re hitting.”

They claimed to bomb the power plant but it wasn’t working anyway. We’re already relying on generators Mohamed Althaibani

To the 72-year-old naturalised US citizen, the airstrikes were a grim reminder that the country he has lived in for four decades views civilian life in his home country as expendable.

Then early this month, a fresh wave of Israeli strikes targeted the airport and a power station in Sana’a, hitting civilian infrastructure and residential areas.

“Many people have died – and for what? There is nothing to strike here, except people trying to live, looking for food.

“We have nothing. They claimed to bomb the power plant but it wasn’t working anyway. We’re already relying on generators,” said Althaibani.

Photos from late April showed the mangled wreck of a car and people gathered around a large crater in the Farwah market in Sana’a after just one of the airstrikes, which the Houthis claimed killed 12 people and wounded 34 others.

For people across Yemen, the airstrikes are a deadly addition to a humanitarian crisis that has overwhelmed the country for more than a decade. Civilians across the country have weathered a bloody civil war as Houthi rebels battled and eventually overwhelmed government forces in the capital, followed by a decade-long campaign of airstrikes and a naval blockade from a military coalition spearheaded by Saudi Arabia.

At least 4.5 million people in Yemen are displaced by the fighting, the UN estimates, while 17 million people are in desperate need of food, including 5 million living on the brink of famine. A decision by the Trump administration to slash the US contribution to aid, particularly at the UN, has left humanitarians fearful that the cuts will further endanger civilian lives in Yemen.

Althaibani describes being swarmed by desperate people each time he leaves the house, with most unable to afford food at the local markets, where even basic goods have become increasingly expensive.

“If I buy imported milk, that can be $6-7 (£5); a lot of people can’t afford that,” he said. “Only people with money can afford these kinds of things; the others are just trying to subsist on bread.”

It was the strike on the Farwah market that made Althaibani weigh whether to leave Sana’a and return home to New York following months of pressure from his family to escape the bombings. Although the airport reopened this week after the Israeli strike earlier this month, he fears it could easily be a target again.

“We used to say to one another, ‘if God loves you, he will send you to America’,” he said, expressing a deep love for the place he has called home, set up businesses and raised a family, but which recently unleashed the deadliest bombing campaign on Yemen in years.

“I feel bad because they bombed my country, but America is my country too,” he said.

Another US strike on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast in mid-April marked one of the single deadliest since Washington drastically escalated its air campaign in Yemen weeks after Donald Trump took office. The family of a 48-year-old truck driver, Nabil Yahya, said he was killed when the fuel tanker he was driving burst into flames after the airstrike on the port.

“That truck was all he had,” said Nabil’s younger brother, Sultan Yahya. “It was his only source of income.”

The US president abruptly announced earlier this month that the US would halt its campaign of airstrikes, claiming that the Houthis had agreed via Omani mediators to halt their attacks on key Red Sea shipping lanes off Yemen’s coast.

“The Houthis have announced to us at least that they just don’t want to fight any more … we will honour that,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “They have capitulated, but more importantly we will take their word that they won’t be blowing up ships any more.”

Washington is spinning a diplomatic defeat as a success Abdullah Sabri

The president’s words provided little reassurance to those in Yemen that the agreement with the Houthis would endure, and left many sceptical about how the Israeli bombing campaign could escalate. Israel has struck Yemen repeatedly in the past 18 months, in response to Houthi rocket attacks on Tel Aviv, while the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, threatened further airstrikes on Yemen earlier this month even without US support.

“Israel will defend itself by itself. We are doing this in Yemen, we are doing this in other places, at great distances. We have harshly struck the Houthis in Yemen, and we still have not had the last word,” he said in a speech earlier this week.

Abdullah Sabri, Yemen’s ambassador to Syria during the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, who was an ally of Iran and the Houthis in Yemen, said US forces had “largely spared the Houthi leadership and military assets,” and instead accused them of targeting civilians and basic infrastructure.

“Washington is spinning a diplomatic defeat as a success,” he added.

Analysts such as Maysaa Shujaa Aldeen, writing for the European Council on Foreign Relations, agreed. While the intense US air campaign initially appeared successful, she said, it had “not delivered broader strategic gains: despite the pounding, the Houthis still managed to attack US targets and Israel. Commercial shipping has not meaningfully resumed.

“Moreover, the campaign has allowed the Houthis to tighten their grip domestically and they now celebrate the US stand-down as a sign of victory,” she said.

While Trump halted American military campaign, the US treasury department has continued to impose waves of sanctions, including on Yemeni banks, in an effort to curb funds flowing to the Houthis and “stop Iran-backed Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea”.

The sanctions on key banks in Sana’a have left many inside Yemen panicking, said Radhya al-Mutawakel, of the human rights organisation Mwatana. “We don’t know if this will eventually affect all banks. Our organisation transferred our money to another bank, but that could be designated at any time,” she said.

“It’s not only direct attacks where civilians are killed, injured and civilian infrastructure destroyed, but daily life, especially at an economic level, is under attack,” she said. “People are just eager to live, they want all of this to stop.”

Murad Ahmed, who works at the port of al-Hudaydah, said the ceasefire agreement between Washington and the Houthis had provided some relief despite fears of future airstrikes. Recent US sanctions also targeted oil tankers delivering fuel to ports including Hudaydah, which Washington claims is under Houthi control, allowing the group to benefit from selling fuel at inflated black market prices.

“After the bombings and fuel blockades, we faced serious crises. Prices were rising to a dangerous point. But two tankers have now been allowed to offload fuel, and conditions are slowly improving,” Ahmed said.

Althaibani said civilians remain caught between the ongoing Israeli bombing campaign, US sanctions and the Houthis, with most unable to do more than shelter in their homes when they hear the sound of bombardments.

“They could target the Houthis if they wanted to, but why are they bombing cities if they don’t want to kill civilians?” he said. “They bombed all over the city and people were scared to flee in case they strike those areas. They decided to die in their homes. There is nothing they can do.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/26/yemen-us-israeli-airstrikes-houthi-famine-humanitarian-crisis-civilians,World
"Oil spill from cargo ship could have lasting consequences for fisheries, says CMFRI chief","The results of possible oil and other contamination in water samples from the Alappuzha and Kollam coasts where a few containers from the cargo vessel that sank off the Kerala coast washed ashore on Monday will be known by Wednesday or Thursday, said sources in the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).

Water samples collected on Monday will be closely analysed during this time span. In addition, the stakeholders concerned have been advised to spread awareness on the need to desist from fishing, 20 nautical miles (around 38 km) into the sea from vulnerable parts of the State’s coastline, they added.

Ecological impact

As regards oil spill in the Arabian Sea, sources in the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) said that its ecological and economic impact would depend on the scale of leakage and how its spread was contained. “Oil smothering could threaten sensitive marine species and disrupt fishing activities, particularly affecting artisanal fishers in coastal regions. If the spill spreads, it may harm marine productivity, especially during the monsoon, a critical period for pelagic fish breeding and growth. This could have lasting consequences for fisheries. The monsoon season typically supports high marine productivity, and we had anticipated a strong fishing season,” said CMFRI Director Grinson George.

The institute would conduct field surveys, collect samples, and track the movement of the spill to evaluate its ecological effects, he added.

Meanwhile, Hibi Eden, MP, has demanded that the consultative committee for shipping take urgent steps to speed up salvaging and also pollution containment, following the sinking of the vessel. He further apprised Union Minister for Ports, Shipping and Water Transport Sarbananda Sonowal of the need to adhere to safety norms in cargo vessels to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. “The Minister said that both the Indian Coast Guard [ICG] and the Director General of Shipping are closely monitoring the situation,” Mr. Eden said.

Sekhar L. Kuriakose, Member Secretary of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), reaffirmed that people must keep a minimum 200-metre distance from the containers and other objects that have washed ashore from the vessel.

The authority is supporting salvaging operations by arranging trailers and other infrastructure to safely ferry containers and other items that are being washed ashore, it is learnt.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/oil-spill-from-cargo-ship-could-have-lasting-consequences-for-fisheries-says-cmfri-chief/article69621889.ece,World
Maltese PM says to officially recognize Palestine as a state,"VALLETTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Malta will officially recognize Palestine as a state, Prime Minister Robert Abela announced on Sunday.

His statement ends more than four decades of deliberation on the issue.

Although Malta hosts a Palestinian ambassador and has long offered implicit recognition, recognizing Palestine as a state will mark the Malta's first formal diplomatic recognition of Palestine.

Addressing Labour Party supporters in Mosta, Abela linked the recognition with the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, strongly condemning Israeli military actions that caused massive civilian casualties. ■",https://english.news.cn/20250525/be76c7f2ee2343b0b88a7198113ce711/c.html,World
"Indonesia, China agree to bolster ties ahead of ASEAN summit","Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto (L) and Chinese Premier Li Qiang inspect a guard of honour during a welcoming ceremony in Jakarta

""Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise globally, posing a serious threat to international economic and trade order,"" Li told Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday, according to Xinhua state news agency.

""In the face of these risks, unity and cooperation are the only viable path forward.""

Beijing and Jakarta are key economic allies, with Chinese companies pouring capital into extracting Indonesian natural resources in recent years, particularly in the nickel sector.

But the two countries' disputed claims into the strategic waterways of the South China Sea and its nearby territories have weighed on their relationship in recent years.

Li said Beijing was keen to further advance cooperation with Southeast Asia's largest economy.

""China is ready to work with Indonesia and other developing countries to... uphold multilateralism and free trade, and advance a multipolar world and inclusive globalisation,"" Li said.

Prabowo also lauded Indonesia's ""close and good"" friendship with China.

""Indonesia is ready to create a safe and prosperous region. Indonesia is ready to strengthen cooperation with China for us to create a peaceful region, which is safe for all,"" the Indonesian leader said.

Prabowo and Li oversaw the signings of several agreements, pledging closer cooperation in areas including economic development and finance.

The presidential palace later announced that eight other agreements were signed in sectors covering tourism, health, investment and media.

The Chinese premier is headed next to Malaysia for an ASEAN summit between members of the 10-country bloc, China and oil-producing countries.

Prabowo had visited Beijing last year, during which Chinese President Xi Jinping told him that he hoped for a ""new chapter"" in bilateral relations.

The two countries have in the past sparred verbally over disputed claims in the South China Sea -- which China claims almost entirely.

Beijing has for years sought to expand its presence in the contested waters, brushing aside an international ruling that its claim has no legal basis.

Chinese vessels have occasionally entered Indonesia-claimed areas of the North Natuna Sea at the southern edge of the South China Sea, drawing protests from Jakarta.

In October, Indonesia said it drove Chinese coast guard ships from contested waters in the South China Sea on three separate occasions.

Aid entering Gaza accounts for less than 1 pct of population's needs: Hamas,"GAZA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said Saturday that the humanitarian aid that has entered the Gaza Strip accounts for less than 1 percent of the Gaza population's basic needs.

""During the 84 days of the blockade and complete closure, at least 46,200 trucks loaded with aid and fuel were supposed to enter the Gaza Strip to meet the minimum needs of the population,"" the office said in a statement.

""However, in recent days, the occupation (Israel) has been promoting a misleading narrative claiming that it is allowing the entry of 'aid,' while the reality shows that only about 100 trucks have actually entered, representing less than 1 percent of the population's basic needs,"" it added.

The office noted that the aid included limited quantities of medicine and flour that reached a limited number of bakeries, at a time ""when the occupation continues to disrupt the operation of more than 90 percent of the Strip's bakeries.""

Israel agreed last week to lift nearly three months of blockade and allow limited relief into the enclave. However, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday that ""all the aid authorized until now amounts to a teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required."" ■",https://english.news.cn/20250525/e9025432ea7e4c3b977cd69880e30cb6/c.html,World

"IDF intercepts Houthi missile fired from Yemen, in third attack in four days","A ballistic missile launched at Israel by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen was successfully intercepted by air defenses, the military said Sunday, in what has recently become an almost daily occurrence.

Sirens had sounded in the Jerusalem area, southern West Bank settlements, and communities near the Dead Sea. Preceding the sirens by about five minutes, an early warning was issued to residents, alerting civilians of the long-range missile attack via a push notification on their phones.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. A chunk of the missile landed in the South Hebron Hills area of the West Bank.

It was the third attack in four days, and the fifth since last Sunday.

Earlier this month, a Houthi missile slipped through air defenses and hit the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, injuring six people, none of them seriously.

A slew of international carriers promptly halted services to Israel, though some have since said they will resume operations.

Israel responded to that attack with strikes on Sanaa airport, causing an estimated $500 million worth of damage. On Saturday, some flights to the Yemeni airport resumed.

The Israeli Air Force has also struck the Houthi-controlled Hodeida and Salif ports in Yemen in response to the Iran-backed group’s repeated attacks on Israel. The Houthis vowed to respond and have since continued their missile attacks on Israel.

The Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — began attacking Israel and general maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.

The Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025.

By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.

Since March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis in Yemen have launched 39 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel. Several of the missiles have fallen short.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-intercepts-houthi-missile-fired-from-yemen-in-third-attack-in-four-days/,World

PA Media Tributes have been left near the scene in Stonebridge

A mother and her three children who died after a house fire that took place in north-west London in the early hours of Saturday morning have been named by police. Nusrat Usman, 43, her daughter Maryam Mikaiel, 15 and two sons Musa Usman, eight, and Raees Usman, four, died when the house in Stonebridge, Brent, went up in flames, the Metropolitan Police said. A 13-year-old girl, who has not been named, remains in hospital in critical condition while a woman in her 70s has been discharged. A man, 41, was arrested on suspicion of murder outside the property. He has since been bailed and detained under the Mental Health Act, the Met said.

Officers were called to Tillett Close at around 01:20 BST on Saturday, attending alongside the London Fire Brigade (LFB). Two terraced three-storey homes were gutted in the fire. Eight fire engines and about 70 firefighters from stations across Wembley, Park Royal and Willesden were sent to tackle the blaze. A teddy bear and flowers were seen laid near the properties on Sunday. Supt Steve Allen, from the local policing team, said on Sunday that specialist officers were supporting the family. ""Our thoughts go out to all those impacted by what has happened,"" he said. ""Local officers are working closely with officers from the Specialist Crime Command on what continues to be a very complex investigation."" Extra officers will also be deployed to the area in the coming days, he added.

PA Media The London Fire Brigade said the fire was ""well-developed"" by the time the crews arrived.

A woman and child were initially rescued from the second floor of one of the affected properties and received emergency care but were declared dead at the scene, the LFB said on Saturday. Two more children were found inside the property and also declared dead, it added. Keeley Foster, LFB assistant commissioner, described the incident as ""extremely tragic"" and said the attending crew were met with a ""well-developed fire"". She added that the LFB would work with the Met to determine the cause of the fire.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2j7xrm13do,World
