"Samsung To Replace Silicon With Glass Interposers By 2028, Aiming For Faster AI Chips, Cheaper Manufacturing, And An Edge In Semiconductor Innovation","Samsung Electronics is taking a major step in the right direction in semiconductor innovation by planning to adopt glass substrate in chip packaging starting in 2028. If you are not familiar, the transition marks a major shift from silicon-based interposers to glass interposers, and it is the first time the company has laid out an official roadmap for the evolution, according to ETNews.

Samsung’s glass interposers could revolutionize AI chip packaging by offering better performance, lower costs, and faster production

In chip manufacturing, interposers are a key component in 2.5D chip packaging, especially for AI semiconductors, where the GPUs are surrounded by high-bandwidth memory or HBM. The interposers are responsible for connecting the two components, allowing for faster communication. While the traditional interposers are effective, they are quite expensive considering how the AI industry is on the rise. In comparison, the glass interposers are cheaper, but feature more precision for ultra-fine circuits and improved dimensional stability.

The benefits of the glass interposers definitely overtake the traditional interposers, which makes them a perfect option for next-gen AI chips. An industry official noted that “Samsung has established a plan to transition from silicon interposers to glass interposers in 2028 to meet customer demands.” The notion is in line with similar plans from competitors like AMD, which shows a surge in industry shift toward the new semiconductor technology.

While the industry is gradually embarking on the glass substrate bandwagon for interposers, Samsung's rendition of the technology is different, as it is developing sub-100x100mm glass units to speed up the prototyping instead of using large glass panels with a size of 510x515mm. Even though the smaller size could hurt the efficiency, it will allow the company to enter the market much faster.

Samsung is also utilizing its Cheonan campus panel-level packaging or PLP line, which makes use of square panels instead of round wafers. Overall, this will allow the company to sit in a much better position than the competition in the AI industry. Furthermore, the move also complements the company's AI Integrated Solution strategy, which would bring the foundry services, HBM memory, and advanced packaging under one umbrella.

With the AI industry booming rapidly, Samsung's transition to a glass substrate for interposers could give it an edge over the competition in the long run. Since the technology is going to improve gradually, the company could also benefit from external orders, which would allow it to increase its revenue. We will keep a close eye on the transition, so be sure to stick around for more details.",https://wccftech.com/samsung-transitions-to-silicon-interposers-from-glass-2028/,Technology

Voices at the frontline,"A

fter the four-day skirmish with India, the media is brimming with patriotic music numbers, leading with Aey Rahe Haq Kay Shaheedo, Wafa Ki Tasweero.

Many remakes and edited versions of the song have been aired across mainstream, streaming and social media platforms. All of it seems to have galvanised the emotions of a public that is constantly threatened and innately insecure.

Artists in the country are forever at the forefront – indeed, the front line – where they perform more than as vocalists, composers or recordists. They are being pitched into a warrior role. Just as it appeared in 1965, the onslaught now seems to be more the preserve of artists, who must speak, sing and defend whatever is being propagated through the mainstream media.

The song Aey Rahe Haq Kay Shaheedo, Wafa Ki Tasweero, originally sung by Naseem Begum, has since been interpreted many times; none perhaps surpass the original in terms of pure musical rendition. The song was recorded for the film Madar-i-Watan, likely released in 1966, and was directed and produced by Saifuddin Saif. A highly regarded poet, Saif belonged to an era when poets maintained a distinction between literary work and film lyrics, although some crossed that barrier without bias. In India, that line blurred earlier, with leading poets contributing openly to cinema.

People usually remember a song by its lyrics, then by the singer who rendered it. Some may recall the poet, but the least remembered, though most vital musically, is the composer.

Artists are being pitched into the warrior category, more than vocalists or composers; they are made to sing and defend what is being propagated.

The duo Salim-Iqbal composed many brilliant film scores. They were among the most gifted music directors in the first three decades of Pakistani cinema. As disciples of the legendary Ustad Sardar Khan of the Delhi Gharana, who migrated to Pakistan in 1947, they also sang for the radio before successfully transitioning to film.

These traditional compositions – once the preserve of the gharanas – were passed down through generations. But with the explosion of technology, remakes developed a distinct character. The sanctity of the original was often lost. Remakes, enhanced by sound production, editing and visual overlays, assumed their own identity, though rarely improving the musical quality of the original.

From Watan Kay Sajeelay Jawano to Aye Putar Hattan Tay Nai Wikday, many such songs, originally written and sung in moments of national intensity, gain new prominence when media demand grows for emotionally charged content. Yet, where music is concerned, there is often little respect for copyright or due credit. A better mechanism should be developed to protect the contributions of artists. Too often, the final product is valued more than those who created it. That balance must be restored in favour of the creative minds whose work is being traded.

AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT vs. Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070,"When AMD launched the Radeon RX 9070 XT, it was positioned as a direct rival to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070. But in the world of graphics cards, real-world pricing often tells a different story than marketing intentions. And when we first put the 9070 XT to a head to head test in 55 games, it wasn't against the 5070 – it was up against the more powerful 5070 Ti.

Predictably, some were upset with that decision, but there was a reason: at the time, AMD's card was priced closer to the Ti variant, and we were curious how it would fare against the tougher competition. The Radeon came in about 5% slower in performance, but roughly 17% cheaper based on what people were actually paying – not the manufacturer's suggested price.

Now, it's time for the head-to-head matchup that some of you were waiting for: 9070 XT vs. RTX 5070.

Since our last round of testing – 55 games deep at 1440p and 4K – both AMD and Nvidia have rolled out driver updates that fine-tuned performance across several titles.

Meanwhile, GPU prices have shifted significantly. The RTX 5070 is settling closer to its MSRP, with cards available for around $610, while the 5070 Ti is now hovering at $825. Surprisingly, the Radeon 9070 XT has gone in the opposite direction – currently selling for about $860 in the US, a full 41% more than the RTX 5070 and even pricier than the faster 5070 Ti.

That's been a surprising turn, especially considering it also represents a 4% premium over the 5070 Ti, despite being 5% slower on average and offering a weaker feature set.

It's a similar story around the globe, with price gaps varying by region but consistently putting the 9070 XT at a premium over the 5070. In Germany, the Radeon 9070 XT costs 745 euros, making it 11% cheaper than the 5070 Ti but still 26% more expensive than the 5070.

That's an improvement compared to what we see in the US, but ideally, the 9070 XT should be at least 20% cheaper than the 5070 Ti and only about 10% more expensive than the 5070.

In Canada, the 9070 XT is priced at $1,100, which is 12% cheaper than the 5070 Ti, but also 34% more than the RTX 5070. Meanwhile, in Australia, both the 5070 and 5070 Ti are available at local MSRP (RRP). At $1,300 AUD, the 9070 XT costs 14% less than the 5070 Ti and 18% more than the 5070.

In short, that means the 9070 XT costs 41% more than the 5070 in the US, 34% more in Canada, 26% more in Germany, and 18% more in Australia.

So, with the latest drivers in play, how much faster is the 9070 XT than the RTX 5070?

We're about to find out with a massive 57-game benchmark covering 1440p and 4K resolutions. We won't walk through every game individually – instead, we'll dive into the key highlights and deliver a comprehensive performance breakdown. Let's get started.

Benchmarks

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

Since our previous testing, the performance of the 9070 XT has improved by 14% at 1440p and 9% at 4K in Black Ops 6, giving the Radeon GPU a significant performance advantage over not just the RTX 5070, but also the 5070 Ti. We're seeing a 68% increase at 1440p and 70% at 4K compared to the 5070.

Hunt: Showdown 1896

Unfortunately, performance has only improved by a few frames in Hunt: Showdown 1896, and as a result, the 9070 XT is much slower than the RTX 5070 – trailing by 12% at 1440p and 18% at 4K. We're testing using the maximum in-game quality settings at native resolution.

Rocket League

The latest GeForce driver has improved performance in Rocket League. The 5070 Ti is now 12% faster than the 9070 XT, with similar results at 4K. Compared to the standard 5070, the 9070 XT is 14% faster at 1440p and 31% faster at 4K.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

The updated GeForce driver has resolved performance issues previously observed in Space Marine 2, and Radeon performance has also improved. As a result, the 9070 XT is 7% faster than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 10% faster at 4K.

Assetto Corsa Competizione

Performance has improved for the 9070 XT in Assetto Corsa Competizione with the new driver. Even so, the 5070 Ti remains much faster. The 9070 XT only manages to match the 5070 at 4K while ending up 9% slower at 1440p.

The Last of Us Part I

In The Last of Us Part I, the 9070 XT was 24% faster than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 37% faster at 4K – a strong result for AMD, as the 9070 XT also outpaced the Ti model.

Starfield

The 9070 XT is particularly strong in Starfield, outperforming the 5070 Ti at both tested resolutions. It's 31% faster than the 5070 at 1440p and 36% faster at 4K, making this an easy win for AMD.

Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced

For Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced, please note we're using the maximum RT quality preset with scaling disabled, meaning all results reflect native resolution. If you enable the preset without adjusting settings, resolution scaling will be turned on by default, increasing FPS.

Here, the 9070 XT doesn't perform particularly well relative to the GeForce GPUs. It was 5% slower than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and only 2% faster at 4K.

Marvel Rivals

In Marvel Rivals, the 9070 XT sits between the 5070 and 5070 Ti, offering 14% better performance than the 5070 at both 1440p and 4K. It's a solid showing compared to the 5070, though still behind the Ti variant.

Horizon Forbidden West

The 9070 XT delivers excellent results in Horizon Forbidden West, comfortably beating the RTX 5070 Ti. It's 34% faster than the 5070 at 1440p and 40% faster at 4K, averaging 80 FPS.

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered

Oblivion Remastered also runs well on the 9070 XT, hitting 69 FPS at 1440p and beating the RTX 5070 by 30%. At 4K, it averaged 44 FPS, giving it a 38% lead.

Cyberpunk 2077

For Cyberpunk 2077, we're using the high preset with upscaling disabled, so results reflect native resolution performance. The 9070 XT delivered 25% higher performance than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 27% higher at 4K.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the newest titles in this test. Here, the 9070 XT roughly matches the 5070 Ti, coming in 24% faster than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 21% faster at 4K.

Monster Hunter Wilds

The 9070 XT performs well in Monster Hunter Wilds, offering 25% better performance than the RTX 5070 at 1440p and 20% better at 4K – clearly positioning it a tier above the similarly priced RTX 5070.

57 Game Performance Summary

1440p Average

At 1440p across the 57 games tested, the 9070 XT was, on average, 17% faster than the RTX 5070. That would be impressive if both cards were available at MSRP, considering the Radeon GPU should cost just 9% more.

However, in Australia it costs 18% more, and pricing in other major regions is typically 30 – 40% higher, meaning the 9070 XT currently represents poor value.

4K Average

The 4K results are only slightly more favorable. The 9070 XT was 21% faster on average compared to the RTX 5070. Again, in Australia it costs 18% more, and in regions such as Canada, Germany, and the US, it is priced significantly higher than the RTX 5070.

Cost Per Frame (versus RTX 5070)

Let's take a look at how the 9070 XT compares to the RTX 5070 in terms of cost per frame across four regions. In Australia, the 9070 XT ends up being slightly worse value than the RTX 5070 – just by a few percent – so in practical terms, they're nearly identical in value.

The 9070 XT does offer more VRAM, while the 5070 features DLSS 4, which has an edge over FSR 4, primarily due to broader adoption.

In Germany, the 9070 XT is 9% worse in value, and in Canada and the US, it's a complete blowout, with the Radeon GPU offering 16 – 22% worse value. In those regions, it's essentially a non-starter.

Cost Per Frame (versus RTX 5070 Ti)

When compared with the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the Radeon 9070 XT becomes even less compelling. Current pricing shows the 9070 XT offering just 9% better cost-per-frame value in Australia, 6% in Germany, 7% in Canada, and remarkably, it's actually 10% worse in the US.

Even in regions where the 9070 XT technically offers better value than the 5070 Ti, the margin is in the single digits – far short of the 20% improvement that would be needed to make it a clearly better option.

Are GeForce owners really going to switch to Radeon for less than a 10% savings? We already know the answer to that. If pricing and availability continue in this direction, Radeon sales are going to slow down fast.

Who Wins?

So there you have it. Across a wide range of games, the 9070 XT is around 20% faster than the RTX 5070, putting it in a higher performance tier. That would be great news for AMD if both GPUs were available at MSRP.

In that case, the Radeon 9070 XT would cost about 10% more while offering 20% more performance. You could also reasonably overlook the GeForce GPU's advantages – such as better upscaling support and superior ray tracing performance – mainly because the latter is hindered by the RTX 5070's limited 12GB of VRAM, which we expect to become a significant limitation in the coming years.

However, as we've just seen, AMD has not been able to maintain its MSRP – something we anticipated in our day-one review. At the time, we reported that AMD was heavily subsidizing the initial batches of product to meet the advertised MSRP, while board partners told us that the actual MSRP for many models was much higher. Here's what we said in that review:

... we have some concerns about how ""real"" the $600 MSRP actually is. After some investigation, it appears that AMD is providing retailers with a $50 rebate to achieve the $600 pricing. This strongly suggests the intended MSRP was actually $650, and AMD is temporarily subsidizing models to hit the lower price point. For example, XFX confirmed that the 9070 XT Mercury – a model featured in this review – will not cost $650. In fact, it won't even cost $700. Instead, the official MSRP is $770, and due to tariffs, its on-shelf price is expected to be $850 – which would be tragic if true. From what we've gathered, it seems AMD is starting to play Nvidia's pricing game. This means that while some 9070 XT models may be available at $600 initially, most will likely be priced higher, and restocks at that price may be limited or infrequent. A lot will depend on how sales perform.

At the time, we predicted that tariffs would push the real price to around $850, based on multiple pre-release sources. Today – two months after launch – the cheapest 9070 XT is $860, which aligns closely with what we were told.

Unfortunately for AMD, this makes things difficult, as Nvidia is now doing better on the pricing front. As we've shown, the RTX 5070 currently offers significantly better value in the US, and even the Ti variant delivers a better cost per frame.

Of course, this depends on the region. In Australia, for example, the RTX 5070 and 9070 XT offer similar value in terms of cost per frame. Given that, we would recommend the 9070 XT locally, primarily because it comes with 16GB of VRAM – which we consider the minimum for any GPU priced at or above $400. That said, the RX 9070 (non-XT), which is nearly 20% cheaper, is the better choice right now in Australia.

However, this doesn't apply to the other regions we analyzed. Remarkably, GeForce GPUs currently offer better value in Germany, Canada, and the US. In Canada, the standard RTX 5070 delivers a 20% better cost per frame than the Ti model, making it a viable option.

Still, we're hesitant to recommend an $820 GPU with just 12GB of VRAM – especially for those planning to play modern titles at maximum settings, using features like ray tracing and frame generation.

So, after a very promising launch, supported by strong initial availability and competitive pricing thanks to months of subsidized inventory, the 9070 series has become a disappointing release, at least based on current pricing. That said, it hasn't yet impacted sales, according to the data we've been able to obtain.

Thanks to the initial hype, the Radeon 9070 XT continues to sell well, locally outperforming the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of units sold. The real issue for AMD is supply, which has kept pricing high. But as it stands today, for the majority of buyers, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the better purchase, and it's the card we recommend over the 9070 XT right now.

Apple Has New Accessibility Features Coming Later This Year,"Apple has new accessibility features coming later this year, from nutrition labels to features for those who are blind or have low vision, Braille Access features, and more.

Along with those announced now, Apple is introducing Accessibility Reader, a new systemwide reading mode designed with accessibility in mind. There are also updates to Live Listen, Background Sounds, Personal Voice, Vehicle Motion Cues, and more.

Accessibility Nutrition Labels Come to the App Store

Accessibility Nutrition Labels bring a new section to App Store product pages that highlights accessibility features within apps and games. These labels help you learn if an app will be accessible to before downloading it, and gives developers the opportunity to better inform and educate their users on features their app supports. This includes VoiceOver, Voice Control, Larger Text, Sufficient Contrast, Reduced Motion, captions, and more.

Accessibility Nutrition Labels will be available on the App Store worldwide, and developers can access more guidance on the criteria apps should meet before displaying accessibility information on their product pages.

New Magnifier for Mac

Since 2016, Magnifier on iPhone and iPad has given users who are blind or have low vision tools to zoom in, read text, and detect objects around them. This year, Magnifier is coming to Mac to make the physical world more accessible for users with low vision. The Magnifier app for Mac connects to the camera so you can zoom in on your surroundings, like a screen or whiteboard. Magnifier works with Continuity Camera on iPhone as well as attached USB cameras and supports reading documents using Desk View.

With multiple live session windows, you can multitask by viewing a presentation with a webcam while simultaneously following along in a book using Desk View. With customized views, you can adjust brightness, contrast, colour filters, and even perspective to make text and images easier to see. Views can also be captured, grouped, and saved to add to later on. Additionally, Magnifier for Mac is integrated with another new accessibility feature, Accessibility Reader, which transforms text from the physical world into a custom legible format.

A New Braille Experience

Braille Access is a new experience that turns iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro into a full-featured braille note taker that’s deeply integrated into the Apple ecosystem. With a built-in app launcher, open any app by typing with Braille Screen Input or a connected braille device. With Braille Access, quickly take notes in braille format and perform calculations using Nemeth Braille, a braille code often used in classrooms for math and science.

Open Braille Ready Format (BRF) files directly from Braille Access, unlocking a wide range of books and files previously created on a braille note taking device. An integrated form of Live Captions allows you to transcribe conversations in real time directly on braille displays.

Accessibility Reader

Accessibility Reader is designed to make text easier to read for users with a wide range of disabilities, such as dyslexia or low vision. Available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro, Accessibility Reader provides new ways to customize text and focus on content you want to read, with extensive options for font, colour, and spacing, as well as support for Spoken Content.

Accessibility Reader can be launched from any app, and is built into the Magnifier app for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, so users can interact with text in the real world, like in books or on dining menus.

Live Captions Arrive on Apple Watch

For users who are deaf or hard of hearing, Live Listen controls come to Apple Watch with a new set of features, including real-time Live Captions. Live Listen turns iPhone into a remote microphone to stream content directly to AirPods, Made for iPhone hearing aids, or Beats headphones. When a session is active on iPhone, you can view Live Captions of what the iPhone hears on a paired Apple Watch while listening along to the audio. Apple Watch serves as a remote control to start or stop Live Listen sessions or jump back in a session to capture something that may have been missed. With Apple Watch, Live Listen sessions can be controlled from across the room, so there’s no need to get up in the middle of a meeting or during class. Live Listen can be used along with hearing health features available on AirPods Pro 2, including the clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature.

An Enhanced View with Apple Vision Pro

For users who are blind or have low vision, visionOS will expand vision accessibility features using the advanced camera system on Apple Vision Pro. With powerful updates to Zoom, you can magnify everything in view, including your surroundings, using the main camera. For VoiceOver users, Live Recognition in visionOS uses on-device machine learning to describe surroundings, find objects, read documents, and more.

For accessibility developers, a new API will enable approved apps to access the main camera to provide live, person-to-person assistance for visual interpretation in apps like Be My Eyes, giving users more ways to understand their surroundings hands-free.

Additional Updates

Background Sounds becomes easier to personalize with new EQ settings, the option to stop automatically after a period of time, and new actions for automations in Shortcuts. Background Sounds can help minimize distractions to increase a sense of focus and relaxation, which some users find can help with symptoms of tinnitus.

For users at risk of losing their ability to speak, Personal Voice becomes faster, easier, and more powerful, leveraging advances in on-device machine learning and artificial intelligence to create a smoother, more natural-sounding voice in less than a minute, using only 10 recorded phrases. Personal Voice will also add support for Spanish (Mexico).2

Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness when riding in a moving vehicle and it is coming to Mac. There are also new ways to customize the animated onscreen dots on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Eye Tracking users on iPhone and iPad will now have the option to use a switch or dwell to make selections. Keyboard typing when using Eye Tracking or Switch Control is now easier on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro with improvements including a new keyboard dwell timer, reduced steps when typing with switches, and enabling QuickPath for iPhone and Vision Pro.

With Head Tracking, users will be able to more easily control iPhone and iPad with head movements, similar to Eye Tracking.

For users with severe mobility disabilities, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS will add a new protocol to support Switch Control for Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), an emerging technology that allows users to control their device without physical movement.

Assistive Access adds a new custom Apple TV app with a simplified media player. Developers will also get support in creating tailored experiences for users with intellectual and developmental disabilities using the Assistive Access API.

Music Haptics on iPhone becomes more customizable with the option to experience haptics for a whole song or for vocals only, as well as the option to adjust the overall intensity of taps, textures, and vibrations.

Sound Recognition adds Name Recognition, a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to know when their name is being called.

Voice Control introduces a new programming mode in Xcode for software developers with limited mobility. Voice Control also adds vocabulary syncing across devices, and will expand language support to include Korean, Arabic (Saudi Arabia), Turkish, Italian, Spanish (Latin America), Mandarin Chinese (Taiwan), English (Singapore), and Russian.

Live Captions adds support to include English (India, Australia, UK, Singapore), Mandarin Chinese (Mainland China), Cantonese (Mainland China, Hong Kong), Spanish (Latin America, Spain), French (France, Canada), Japanese, German (Germany), and Korean.

Updates to CarPlay include support for Large Text. With updates to Sound Recognition in CarPlay, drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing can now be notified of the sound of a crying baby, in addition to sounds outside the car such as horns and sirens.

Share Accessibility Settings is a new way for users to quickly and temporarily share their accessibility settings with another iPhone or iPad. This is great for borrowing a friend’s device or using a public kiosk in a setting like a cafe.

Apple Retail is introducing dedicated tables spotlighting accessibility features on a variety of devices in select store locations throughout the month of May. Additionally, Apple offers accessibility sessions year-round through Today at Apple for deeper learning, tips, and feature customization. Sessions can be scheduled at all Apple Store locations worldwide through Group Booking or by visiting a nearby store.",https://wifihifi.com/apple-new-accessibility-features-2025/,Technology
Govt Issues Critical Hacking Threat Through Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox,"The National Computer Emergency Response Team (NCERT) has issued a critical advisory warning users of serious zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.

These flaws have already been exploited in the wild, enabling cybercriminals to execute arbitrary code, steal sensitive data, hijack browser sessions, and deploy malware through malicious websites or content.

According to the advisory, vulnerabilities in Firefox were demonstrated during the Pwn2Own hacking contest, while a severe flaw in Chrome’s WebAssembly module allows for cross-origin data theft.

These issues pose a major risk due to the widespread usage of both browsers across desktop and mobile devices. Attackers can gain unauthorized access, execute remote code, and compromise entire systems, putting user credentials, stored data, and online activities at risk.

NCERT’s advisory outlines five major impacts of these vulnerabilities: remote code execution through malicious scripts, unauthorized session access, system compromise leading to malware installation, exposure of personal or stored data, and the possibility of ransomware or spyware delivery via browser-based attacks.

According to technical details, Mozilla Firefox is affected by CVE-2025-4918 and CVE-2025-4919, which involve JavaScript-related flaws that bypass JIT compiler protections. Google Chrome is vulnerable under CVE-2025-4664 due to a WebAssembly flaw that enables session hijacking and unauthorized data access. These vulnerabilities are actively being exploited, making it essential for users to take immediate action.

The advisory strongly recommends that users install the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome to mitigate the threat. Additionally, users are advised to avoid visiting unverified websites and restrict access to unknown online sources to prevent potential hacking attempts.

The threat applies to both desktop and mobile device users, underlining the urgency of securing web browsing environments.",https://propakistani.pk/2025/05/23/govt-issues-critical-hacking-threat-through-google-chrome-and-mozilla-firefox/,Technology
Instagram adds handy new DM features in latest update,"A new Instagram update has rolled out that brings more features to its Direct Messages (DMs), aiming to make chats more flexible and useful.

This Instagram update reflects the way people now use the app, with more photos and videos being shared privately rather than publicly.

Instagram chief Adam Mosseri recently said that DM sharing is now far more common than posting to the feed or Stories. Calling it a “paradigm shift,” Mosseri explained that this change in user behaviour is why the company is focusing more on messaging features.

One of the key changes in this update is the ability to transcribe voice messages.

When users receive a voice clip, they will see a “View transcription” button, which shows the text of the message either before, during, or after listening.

This feature makes it easier to understand voice messages when you’re in a place where listening isn’t possible.

Another feature introduced with this Instagram update is the extension of voice message length. Until now, voice clips in DMs could only be one minute long, but they can now be up to five minutes.

Read More: Meta faces existential threat at trial over Instagram, WhatsApp

This gives users more time to say what they want, and those receiving the message can still use the new transcription tool.

Instagram had been testing the longer voice message option with some users before making it available to everyone. Now, it is part of the broader Instagram update that improves how people communicate in the app.

Finally, the Instagram update also includes a “Follow All” button in group chats.

This Instagram update allows users to follow everyone in the group quickly, without having to tap on each profile one by one. It could be useful in large group chats where not all members are already connected.

This Instagram update shows the platform’s growing focus on DMs and adapting to how users now prefer to share and chat.",https://arynews.tv/instagram-update-adds-voice-message-transcription-new-features/,Technology

Intel Announces Entry-Level “Core Ultra 200” Workstation Desktop And Laptop CPUs,"Intel has unveiled a wide range of entry-level workstation solutions for consumers, featuring the Intel Arrow Lake ""Core Ultra 200"" CPUs.

Intel Debuts Affordable Workstations Based on Arrow Lake ""Core Ultra 200"" CPUs: Claims Superior Performance Compared to Its Rivals

The Intel client segment received entry-level workstation systems for consumers, which will offer competitive performance on a budget. Intel has announced both desktop and laptop workstations, equipped with the latest Intel Core Ultra processors, offering noticeable performance uplifts over its rival.

In the desktop segment, Intel claims up to 13% higher multithreaded performance with Core Ultra 200S in programs like Cinebench Multicore 2024 vs AMD's flagship Ryzen 9 9950X. This is reportedly achieved at 11% better performance per watt compared to the AMD CPU, when both operated at 125W of TDP. The desktop workstation systems will offer up to 256 Gb-6400 of DDR5 EEC memory, WiFi 6E, and features such as remote KVM, Intel vPro, and Pro Codec support.

The laptop workstation segment brings Intel Core Ultra 200HX and Intel Core Ultra 200H processors for high-performance and thin & light laptops, respectively. The Core Ultra 200HX reportedly delivers up to 8% and 42% higher single and multithreaded performance vs Ryzen AI 9 HX 375, respectively. With a good 41% better power efficiency vs Meteor Lake, the 200HX laptops can deliver superior performance at the same wattage.

2 of 9

The HP ZBook Furey 18 is one of the first workstation laptops, which is scheduled for a retail launch in June and will bring up to 256 Gb of EEC DDR5 memory and built-in NPU for local AI workload execution. Intel has also shared benchmarks of the flagship Core Ultra 9 285HX vs the i9 14900HX from previous gen to showcase the uplifts the Core Ultra 200HX brings in popular professional workloads.

Then we have the Intel Core Ultra 200H-based budget workstation laptops such as the Dell Pro Max 16, which deliver up to 22% faster performance vs Ryzen AI 9 365 in Geekbench 6.3 multicore workload and a staggering 21+ hours of battery life. It will feature the Arc 140T integrated graphics, which can take care of both professional workloads and gaming. Compared to the Ryzen 9 8945HS, which is a Zen 4 chip, the Core Ultra 200H delivers up to 36% better performance across 9 applications.

2 of 9

Similarly, the flagship Core Ultra 9 285H delivers up to 26% better performance than Zen 5-based Ryzen AI 9 365 in 6 different applications. Intel also shared its Arc 140T performance prowess in apps like Autodesk Inventor and Chaos V-Ray for Cinema 4D, where the 200H chip is 2.15X and 1.30X faster than the iGPU present on the Core Ultra 185H, respectively. However, those who crave even superior graphical performance can opt for the latest Arc Pro B60 24 GB or the Arc Pro B50 16 GB workstation GPUs, but these can only be used on desktops.",https://wccftech.com/intel-entry-level-workstation-desktops-laptops-core-ultra-200-arrow-lake-cpus/,Technology
SynthID Detector aims to boost transparency in AI content,"25 May 2025

SynthID Detector aims to boost transparency in AI content

Google has launched SynthID Detector, a verification portal designed to identify whether content was created using its AI models. The tool scans for SynthID, Google’s watermarking technology, which invisibly marks text, images, audio, and video generated by tools such as Gemini, Imagen, Lyria, and Veo.

The Detector highlights which parts of the content likely contain SynthID watermarks. These watermarks are invisible and do not affect the quality of the media. According to Google, over 10 billion pieces of AI-generated content have already been marked using SynthID.

Users can upload files to the SynthID Detector web portal, which then checks for the presence of watermarks. For example, the tool can identify specific segments in an audio file or regions in an image where watermarks are embedded.

Initially rolled out to early testers, the tool will become more widely available in the coming weeks. Google has also open sourced SynthID’s text watermarking technology to allow broader integration by developers.

The company says SynthID is part of a broader effort to address misinformation and improve transparency around AI-generated content. Google emphasized the importance of working with the AI community to support content authenticity as AI tools become more widespread.

5 Android 16 features I can't wait to try,"Google took the fun out of Android updates. It barely introduced any noticeable changes that would make me get excited. Android 16 was shaping up to be a relatively boring upgrade until Google unveiled its features at The Android Show: I/O Edition on May 13.

With Material 3 Expressive, a revamped Quick Settings panel, and Live Updates, Android 16 brings many features I'm excited to try on my Android phone. It feels like one of the most significant Android upgrades in years.

5 Advanced Protection mode

Consolidating all security features

Source: Google

Over the last few years, Google has added several features to Android to bolster its security. Still, there's room for improvement. Plus, I feel Android's security features are lacking compared to the iPhone.

With Android 16, Google is taking a big step to remedy this. A new Advanced Protection mode will bring major security-related settings under one section. So, you won't have to dive deep into your phone's settings menu to enable Theft Detection or offline device finding.

With a single Advanced Protection toggle, you can enable all available security measures in Android across several categories. The list is as follows:

Intrusion Logging

Theft Detection Lock

Offline Device Lock

Inactivity Reboot

USB Protection

Google Play Protect

Unknown App Protection

Memory Tagging Extension

Android Safe Browsing

Chrome Safe Browsing

Javascript Protection

Unsafe Link Protection

Spam and Scam Protection (Google Messages)

Spam and Scam Protection (Phone by Google)

Called ID & Spam

Automatic Call Screening

2G Network Protection

Disable Auto-Reconnect to Insecure Networks

Many of these security features are scattered throughout the OS. For example, the Caller ID & Spam protection settings are in the Phone app settings, while the Google Play Protection option is under Security & Privacy.

Intrusion Logging is a new security feature in Android 16 that creates and maintains a device activity log for post-breach analysis. It's end-to-end encrypted and stored in the cloud, ensuring it is safe yet easily accessible.

Inactivity Reboot is another new security feature in Android 16 that will automatically restart your Android phone if it stays locked and idle for 72 hours. This will ensure all user data remains unreadable until the device is unlocked by entering the PIN or password.

Advanced Protection Mode in Android 16 won't benefit me much. I only enable such features while traveling. Still, it's a welcome addition that will strengthen Android's security.

While Advanced Protection will go live with Android 16's initial release in June, many of its new features will go live later this year.

4 Revamped Quick Settings panel

An iOS 18-inspired change

It's almost a ritual for Google to change the Quick Settings panel with every major Android release. Android 16 will continue that trend, and I am excited about the changes Google plans to make. It's adding resizable toggles. Plus, one-click Wi-Fi and Bluetooth toggles are making a comeback.

The other noticeable change is a new look for the tiles, so they occupy less space than before. As seen on some Chinese Android skins, expanding the Quick Settings panel will blur the background to add a depth effect.

It feels like Google has taken inspiration from iOS 18's revamped Control Center for Android 16's Quick Settings panel. It appears to be a big usability improvement.

The revamped Quick Settings panel in Android 16 will not be a part of the OS' June release. Instead, it will arrive later in the year.

3 Ultra HDR support for HEIC images

Bringing richer colors and details to a new image format

Source: Sammyfans

I take a lot of pictures with my phone. Given that JPEGs take a lot of space, I set the camera app on my phone to save them in the space-efficient HEIC format. The catch is that Android doesn't support Ultra HDR for photos saved in the HEIC format. So, I take pictures in JPEG, which eats into my 2TB Google One storage.

Android 16 will change this by adding Ultra HDR support for HEIC images. Google is also working on UltraHDR support for AVIF images, and that will arrive in the future.

Google introduced Ultra HDR with Android 14. It allows pictures to have higher dynamic range and enhanced color. It delivers these improvements with no compatibility issues. Ultra HDR JPEG images automatically fall back to the SDR gain map on devices with SDR displays. With Android 15, Google made Ultra HDR support mandatory for phones with performance class 15.

With Android 16 bringing Ultra HDR support to HEIC images, let's hope Google also updates the Pixel Camera app to allow saving photos in HEIC by default instead of JPEG.

2 Material 3 Expressive

A bold and colorful look

Android 16 marks the debut of Material 3 Expressive, Google's new design language for phones and tablets. It is also one of the biggest user-facing changes in the OS. It does not bring a big visual overhaul. Instead, it builds on Material Design 3 to add bouncy and slick animations, bigger buttons, bolder fonts, and more.

Material 3 Expressive comes at the right time. Google debuted Material Design 3 with Android 13 four years ago, so the current design felt stale. Plus, it brings the correct improvements while keeping the familiarity intact. Instead of going ga-ga over Material 3 Expressive, I will let this GIF from Google do the talking:

Source: Google

See the springy new animation with larger touch points for the most commonly used options? Here's how Google explains the Material 3 Expressive design changes in the notification panel: ""For example, when you dismiss a notification, the others next to it subtly respond to your drag. And when you snap it off the stack, you feel a satisfying haptic rumble.""

You will find this polish throughout Android 16, with slick animations and haptic feedback, including when dismissing apps from the recent apps screen or changing the system volume. Along with Material 3 Expressive, Android 16 will update the dynamic color themes, so apps will pull more colors from your wallpaper.

From what Google has shown, Material 3 Expressive looks good, and it's one of the major Android 16 features that I am most excited about. The only bummer? Material 3 Expressive won't be a part of Android 16's initial public release in June. Instead, it will arrive later in the year.

Taking the headache out of keeping up with real-time notifications

Source: Google

Food delivery apps have become a part of our lives. Unlike other apps, food delivery apps like Uber and Grubhub deliver urgent and real-time notifications. It's the same with sports apps. You want real-time updates in your phone's notification shade, instead of opening the app for this.

While Android's notification panel is more powerful than iOS's, it struggles to deliver live updates effectively. Apple nailed this with Live Activities, making it effortless to track sports scores and food delivery status in real time.

Google is taking inspiration from iOS and introducing a similar feature in Android 16: Live Updates. It will provide real-time tracking of your food delivery status on your phone's lock screen or in the notification shade. The status appears when you use Always-On Display. Google's implementation also adds useful Call, Message, and Tip buttons to the Live Update notification.

I constantly open the food delivery app to check its status, which is annoying and a waste of time. Android manufacturers like OnePlus and Oppo added a feature similar to the iPhone's Live Activities to their skins, but the implementation is buggy and is not reliable. An official solution from Google should take care of these issues.

You'll have to wait to try Android 16 in all its glory

While Android 16 is a feature-packed release, it needs some long-awaited features and won't launch with all the new goodies in June. Instead, Google will release bigger changes later in the year, presumably alongside the Pixel 10 family and a Quarterly Platform Release. Plus, non-Pixel phones might miss out on some changes as the device manufacturer may decide not to implement them in their skin.",https://www.androidpolice.com/android-16-features-i-cant-wait-to-try/,Technology

Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is now available for purchase in South Korea,"Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is now available for purchase in South Korea

The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, unveiled last week, will go on sale in most regions starting May 30, but if you live in South Korea, you can purchase the smartphone from Samsung's official South Korean website and offline retail stores.

The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is sold in South Korea in silver, blue, and black colors. All three come in two memory configurations - 12GB/256GB and 12GB/512GB, priced at KRW1,496,000 ($1,095/€965/INR93,325) and KRW1,639,000 ($1,200/€1,055/INR102,250).



Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge

The biggest highlight of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is its sleek design. The smartphone is 5.8mm thin and weighs 163g. Key specs of the S25 Edge include the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, a 6.7"" 120Hz LTPO AMOLED 1,440p display, a 200MP primary camera, and a 3,900 mAh battery with 25W charging.

"Deals: Galaxy lineup is up to 33% off, including big discounts for the Galaxy S25 series","Amazon has discounts of up to 33% on most of the Samsung Galaxy lineup, ranging from the flagship S25 Ultra down to the entry-level A26.

The announcement of the S25 Edge caused deals on the other S25 models to dry up temporarily, but now they are back. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is €420 off if you go for the 512GB variant.

The Samsung Galaxy S25+ is under €1,000, even for the 512GB model, while last week even the 256GB one was over €1,100. That opens quite a gap to the S25 Edge, which is €1,250 (with a free storage upgrade to 512GB). Even the Ultra is cheaper than the Edge!

The vanilla Samsung Galaxy S25 has dipped under the €700 mark – this is for the 256GB variant. Due to how the discounts work out, the 128GB variant actually ends up being more expensive, so we didn’t bother including it here.

For the mid-range, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is pretty cheap if you settle for the 128GB model. Having to pay over €90 for just 128GB extra hurts – that said, it may be the wise choice in the long run. This phone will receive OS updates for 6 more years and Android versions tend to get bigger, not smaller.

The Samsung Galaxy A56 offers a pretty cheap upgrade to 256GB, making it a no-brainer over the 128GB A56. However, you still may want to go for the S24 FE – its Exynos 2400e is 70-80% faster (sometimes more) than the Exynos 1580 inside the A-phone. And you lose the 8MP 3x/75mm telephoto camera.

The A56 has faster charging (45W wired only vs. 25W wired and 15W wireless) and it trades blows with the S24 FE when it comes to endurance (it’s better at browsing, not as good at gaming).

There’s also the Samsung Galaxy A36, but the value-for-money is not so good – you lose even more performance, the camera also takes a hit and the A36 has a plastic frame instead of an aluminum one. Check out the Galaxy A36 vs. A56 head-to-head comparison for more details.

Finally, the Samsung Galaxy A26 price has been slashed by a third. The phone has a lot of similarities with the Galaxy A36 – detailed comparison here – but it also loses out on a lot of upgrades. Still, the A36 costs €75 more, which is quite a bit in the €200-€300 segment, so check out our comparison article to help you make up your mind.

Meta files a Smartglasses / AR Glasses patent that relates to Gaze-Driven Adaptive Content Generation using Machine Learning and AI,"In Mid-April, Patently Apple posted a report titled “One of Tim Cook’s focuses is to beat Meta’s Orion AR Glasses to market.” Then on May 22 we posted a related patent about new Apple leaks on their 2026 AI Glasses. As Apple rushes to enter the AI (and AR) glasses market beginning in late 2026, it’s all the more important to follow news and patents from Meta and other potential rivals in order to understand the technology Apple will be competing with.

Meta’s patent describes a system for adaptive content generation in AR, VR, and MR environments based on user interactions. It uses machine learning models to analyze eye tracking, facial expressions, muscle movements, pupil dilation, and heart rate to determine user interest levels.

Random Patent Points

Biometric data may include, but is not limited to, heart rate(s), skin conductivity, blood pressure(s) and/or thermal imaging, which may provide insights into a user's physiological state and may be indicative of stress levels, excitement, or discomfort. Environmental context data may include, but is not limited to, ambient noise levels, lighting conditions, and/or nearby objects or people, which may help a device/system (e.g., AR device 15) understand external factors that may influence user behavior and preferences.

The eye tracking system within the AR device may determine the heart rate(s) of a user by utilizing a technique known as remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). This method may involve capturing video streams of a user(s), specifically focusing on visible changes in pigmentation that may occur as blood pumps through the facial tissues of a user. These subtle changes in pigmentation may not be typically visible to the human eye but may be detected by high-resolution with an AR device.

the AR device (e.g., via the AI content assistant 407) may adapt the content being displayed/presented to the user and/or may provide other content (e.g., AR content) to the user (e.g., via the display/touchpad/user interface(s), display 414) for viewing/interaction by the user with the adapted content and/or other content based on the determined facial expressions of the user.

The AR device may utilize a face tracking system to analyze the user's facial expressions/features, which may provide additional insights into the user's emotional state and level of interest. The face tracking system may employ one or more cameras to capture real-time video of the user's face, and may utilize machine learning models to recognize and interpret various facial expressions such as smiles, frowns, or looks of surprise. For example, in an instance in which the user smiles or shows expressions of awe while interacting with a particular segment of AR content, the AR device may interpret these expressions as indicators of enjoyment or fascination. In response, the AR device may enhance the content being displayed to the user in similar themes or provide/present more complex, related topics to deepen the user's engagement.

Here’s an example of how this adaptive content technology could be applied in virtual reality (VR) gaming:

Example Application: Personalized VR Gaming Experience

Imagine a VR adventure game that adapts dynamically to your emotions and focus level. As you play:

Gaze Tracking & Facial Recognition

The game monitors your eye movements and facial expressions.

If you focus intensely on a particular object (e.g., a locked door), the game might offer a hidden clue nearby.

Real-Time Difficulty Adjustment

If the system detects frustration (furrowed brows, tense muscles), it might slightly ease the difficulty of a puzzle.

If it detects engagement and excitement, it could introduce extra challenges for a more immersive experience.

Adaptive Storytelling

Your choices and reactions could shape the game’s narrative.

For example, if you react emotionally to a certain character, the game could expand their storyline.

Gesture-Based Controls

Your eye gaze or facial movements could trigger interactions.

Instead of pressing a button to open a door, simply looking at the handle with focused attention could trigger an action.

This concept could also be used in VR training simulations, AR learning environments, or immersive entertainment.

This adaptive content technology could revolutionize education and social interaction by making experiences more personalized and engaging.

For Education

Personalized Learning

A virtual classroom could adjust lessons based on a student's focus and interest level.

If a student seems engaged (e.g., maintains eye contact, shows positive facial expressions), more challenging content could be introduced.

If signs of confusion appear (e.g., furrowed brows, wandering gaze), the system might slow down or provide additional explanations.

Real-Time Assistance

AR-based education tools could track a student's gaze and reactions to determine which subjects need more support.

AI tutors could offer hints or explanations when frustration is detected.

Immersive Learning Environments

History lessons could let students explore ancient civilizations in VR, adjusting environments based on their engagement.

Science experiments could respond to student curiosity, adapting visuals dynamically.

For Social Interaction

AR/VR Social Spaces

Virtual gatherings could adjust avatars, environments, and conversation dynamics based on participants’ reactions.

A social VR platform could change the atmosphere—if a user shows boredom, visuals might shift to encourage engagement.

Empathy & Accessibility

Adaptive AI could help individuals with disabilities, modifying interactions for non-verbal communication.

In therapy sessions, VR could track emotional states to offer a more responsive experience.

AI-Powered Conversations

A smart assistant in VR social apps could interpret facial cues to suggest topics or questions based on interest level.

Eye-tracking technology could help users with limited mobility navigate virtual environments effortlessly.

This tech could create learning and social spaces that dynamically respond to engagement levels, making interactions more meaningful and tailored.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 allegedly spotted in the wild,"As a quick refresher, Samsung is expected to launch a total of three foldables in early July: the Galaxy Z Fold7, Z Flip7 and Z Flip7 FE. Reportedly, mass production of the devices is well underway, so it comes as no surprise that product spy shots are starting to surface online.

The particular photo we have is allegedly of the Z Fold7 and, more specifically, its backside. Arguably, that's the most boring angle to view the device from since it reveals nothing regarding its alleged new edge-to-edge cover display or its reported impressive thinness, measuring just 3.9mm. We can't see the allegedly massively reduced inner display bezels either. Just a backside with a familiar vertical triple-camera arrangement. In fact, this could easily be a dummy unit and perhaps not even a complete one, but just one half. Regardless, it's a first look at the device in real life. Plus, the original Weibo source of the image seems to be gone, which suggests there is at least a bit of credibility to the leak.

Speaking of dimensions, we believe the Z Fold7 will measure 158.4 x 143.1 x 3.9 mm. We also think that the phone will use the Snapdragon 8 Elite globally, which is not necessarily a given for the other cited foldables. The Z Flip7, for instance, will likely only use the Snapdragon 8 Elite in North America and China but rely on the Exynos 2500 in other markets. As for the mystical Z Flip7 FE, which we still know very little about, it is assumed to use the older Exynos 2400.

See green line appear live on Samsung phone’s OLED display,"In the last few years, many users of Samsung smartphones with AMOLED displays have reported that their phone’s screen develops a permanent green line (or sometimes multiple green lines) as the phone ages or while installing a software update. However, we never got to see the green line appear in real time. Well, now we do.

On Reddit, a user has posted a video of their Galaxy S21 FE updating to Android 14-based One UI 6.1. While the installation was about 60% complete, a green line appeared on the left-hand side of the display. From what we could gather, this is the first video to show a green line appearing on a Samsung phone’s display in real time.

The user, who seems to be from India, says that he read that many users reported that while updating the Galaxy S21 FE to One UI 6.1, a green line appears on the screen. As such, the user didn’t want to get the update. However, they downloaded the update by mistake, and to get rid of installation reminders, they decided to install the update.

However, the user also decided to record a video of the installation so that if the green line appears, they will have proof that it developed on its own and not due to the user’s mishandling of the device, which they may be able to show to service centre and get the issue resolved without paying any charge, which has fetched us the first video on the instance.

How Manus AI is Redefining Autonomous Workflow Automation Across Industries,"China has made significant advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years, and one of the most notable developments is Manus AI. Launched in March 2025 by Butterfly Effect, with backing from Tencent, Manus aims to transform industries by autonomously automating complex tasks.

From coding to financial analysis, this AI agent is designed to operate with minimal human intervention. While Manus shows great potential, it also has its limitations. Understanding its capabilities, limitations, and areas for improvement is essential to grasping the role it could play in the future of AI.

What is Manus AI?

Manus AI is a cutting-edge autonomous agent developed by the Chinese startup known as Butterfly Effect AI. Unlike traditional AI assistants, which typically rely on step-by-step instructions or focus on specific tasks, Manus is capable of handling complex, real-world workflows with minimal human input. It can take on a variety of tasks, from writing code and generating financial reports to planning travel itineraries and analyzing large datasets, all while operating in the background, even when the user is offline.

What sets Manus apart is its ability to break down complex tasks into structured workflows, plan and execute each step, and adapt its approach based on user objectives. It employs a multi-model architecture, integrating advanced language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Alibaba’s Qwen, along with custom automation scripts. This enables Manus to process and generate different types of data, such as text, images, and code, and interact directly with external tools like web browsers, code editors, and APIs, making it a highly versatile tool for developers and businesses alike. Manus also has adaptive learning capabilities that enable it to remember previous interactions and user preferences. This helps improve its performance over time, delivering more personalized and efficient results. With its asynchronous, cloud-based operation, Manus can continue executing tasks even when users are offline.

The rapid growth of its Discord community and viral demo video highlights the excitement and strong demand for Manus in the tech world. Overall, Manus AI is undergoing a significant advancement in autonomous AI. It moves beyond simple chatbots to become a digital worker capable of independently managing entire workflows.

The Technical Architecture of Manus AI

Manus AI employs a complex architecture that integrates multiple advanced AI models and orchestration layers to enable efficient, multi-step task automation. Unlike a traditional AI model, Manus functions as a comprehensive system, coordinating a variety of cutting-edge AI technologies, custom tools, and execution environments to handle complex workflows effectively.

Multi-Model Orchestration

Manus uses a multi-model approach, integrating top Large Language Models (LLMs) like Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Alibaba’s Qwen. This enables Manus to dynamically select and combine model outputs based on the requirements of each task. The orchestration layer acts as a central controller, breaking down complex requests into smaller, manageable tasks, assigning them to the most appropriate model, and synthesizing the results into a cohesive workflow.

CodeAct Paradigm and Tool Integration

A key innovation in Manus is the CodeAct paradigm. Instead of just generating text responses, Manus creates executable Python code snippets as part of its process. These code actions are run in a secure, sandboxed environment, enabling Manus to interact with external systems such as APIs, web browsers, databases, and even system tools. This makes Manus from being just a conversational assistant to a digital agent capable of handling real-world tasks, such as scraping Web data, generating reports, or deploying software.

Autonomous Planning, Memory, and Feedback Loops

Manus includes an autonomous planning module that breaks down high-level goals into a series of steps. It also has both short-term and long-term memory, often stored in vector databases and using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to remember user preferences, previous outputs, and relevant documents. This memory helps Manus maintain accuracy and continuity across different sessions and tasks.

A built-in feedback loop is also part of the system. After each action, Manus reviews the results, adjusts its plan if needed, and repeats the process until the task is completed or stopped. This feedback loop allows Manus to adapt to unexpected outcomes or errors, making it more resilient in complex situations.

Security, Sandboxing, and Governance

Since Manus can execute code and interact with external systems, security is a top priority. It runs all code actions in isolated, sandboxed environments to prevent unauthorized access or potential system breaches. Strict governance rules and prompt engineering are also in place to make sure Manus complies with safety standards and user-defined policies.

Scalability and Cloud-Native Design

Manus is designed to work in the cloud, allowing it to scale horizontally across distributed systems. This design ensures Manus can handle many users and complex tasks simultaneously without slowing down. However, as reported by users, system stability during peak usage is still an area being optimized for better performance.

Real-World Applications

Manus AI has the potential to transform industries like finance, healthcare, logistics, and software development by automating complex workflows with minimal human intervention.

In the finance sector, Manus AI can potentially assist with tasks like risk analysis, fraud detection, and generating financial reports. By processing large datasets in real-time, it could help financial analysts identify trends and make informed decisions about investments, market risks, and portfolio management.

In healthcare, Manus AI could be used for analyzing patient data, identifying patterns, and suggesting treatment plans. It holds the potential to propose personalized healthcare options based on a patient’s medical history, which could play a role in improving patient care and assisting with medical research.

In logistics, Manus AI may optimize supply chain management, schedule deliveries, and predict potential disruptions. By adjusting delivery schedules based on real-time traffic data, it could help minimize delays and improve operational efficiency.

It scored 86.5% on basic tasks, 70.1% on intermediate tasks, and 57.7% on complex tasks, compared to Deep Research’s 74.3%, 69.1%, and 47.6% in the same categories.

Early user experiences also highlight Manus's ability to autonomously plan, execute, and refine multi-step workflows with minimal human input. This makes Manus particularly appealing to developers and businesses looking for reliable automation for complex tasks.

However, Manus still faces several challenges. Users have reported system instability, including crashes and server overloads, particularly when the AI is tasked with managing multiple or complex operations. There are also cases where Manus gets stuck in repetitive loops or fails to complete specific tasks, which require human intervention. Such issues can affect productivity, especially in high-pressure or time-sensitive environments.

Another concern is Manus’s reliance on existing models like Anthropic’s Claude and Alibaba’s Qwen. While these models contribute to Manus’s strong performance, they also raise questions about the originality of the technology. Instead of being a completely new AI, Manus often serves as an orchestrator of these models, which may limit its long-term potential for innovation.

Security and privacy are also significant concerns, particularly because Manus has access to sensitive data and can execute commands autonomously. The risk of cyberattacks or data breaches is a concern, especially considering recent controversies surrounding data sharing by some Chinese AI firms. As noted by industry experts, these issues may make it more difficult for Manus to be adopted in Western markets.

China Focus: Scientists develop insect-inspired vision system with AI capabilities,"BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have recently made a major breakthrough in the field of bionic vision, paving a new path for microscopic observation and high-end instrument development.

The study, a collaboration between the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology and Duke University in the United States, was published in the journal Science Advances on Thursday.

Inspired by insect compound eyes, scientists have previously developed various imaging systems using microlens arrays and sensors, achieving initial applications.

However, traditional bionic compound-eye systems have long faced limitations due to their complex 3D structures and restricted spatial resolution, resulting in blurry imaging.

""We aim not only to let bionic vision systems 'see' the world but also 'see clearly' and 'understand' it,"" said Zhang Dawei, a professor at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology and leader of the research team.

The innovative breakthrough stems from an in-depth bionic study of the structural characteristics and information-processing mechanisms of arthropod compound eyes.

Insects rely on hundreds or thousands of small visual units working together to respond instantly to complex environments. Mimicking this, the team developed a compact 0.8-cubic-centimeter bionic vision system capable of megapixel-level, full-color, ultra-wide-field (165°×360°) high-resolution imaging.

Using deep learning, the team built a multi-level visual processing model that performs tasks such as high-definition panoramic image reconstruction, wide-field multi-target positioning, object recognition, multi-target tracking, and 3D tracking.

This advancement enables bionic vision to truly ""see clearly and understand,"" overcoming traditional limitations.

Zhuang Songlin, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said the research exemplifies interdisciplinary innovation by merging bionics with AI.

The team is now refining the bionic compound-eye structure, focusing on applications in micro-unmanned platforms, endoscopic inspection instruments and other high-end equipment.

This achievement not only advances AI-powered scientific instruments but also supports advancements in medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring and intelligent security, demonstrating strong potential from fundamental research to industrial applications. ■",https://english.news.cn/20250525/2ab9f9c6d4fb42e5a4e63f83527e1cc2/c.html,Technology
Apple's future AI devices awaiting Siri upgrades ahead of launch,"Two future iPad-like devices that rely on future Apple Intelligence features will come to market only after the long-promised major Siri upgrade.

Apple is said to be working on two different ""home hub"" devices for release in the near future. One is expected to be a mountable iPad-like screen to control smart-home devices, while the other is envisioned as a tabletop device with a robotic arm.

A new report from Bloomberg suggests that both are currently waiting on the delayed revamp of Siri before coming to market. A revamp that incorporates on-screen awareness, which will be essential for the smart home products to function properly.

Responsibility for completing the long-awaited Siri upgrade has recently been handed to Apple Vision Pro leader Mike Rockwell's team.

The two distinct devices have been code-named J490 — the wall-mounted iPad home hub — and J595 for the robotic-arm mounted interactive tabletop screen.

The former is now expected to arrive either near the end of 2025 or in the first half of 2026. It is also currently undergoing internal employee testing.

The more ambitious robotic arm product, J595, is now expected to follow in the second half of 2026 or early 2027. However, it will probably be missing some of its more innovative features when it first ships.

The current focus of the teams behind the products is to get them to market as quickly as possible after last year's showcased Siri upgrade finally arrives. Apple has acknowledged that the more contextual Siri, which relies on Apple Intelligence features that depend on app intents, has been delayed.",https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/05/25/apples-ai-smart-screen-devices-will-have-to-wait-on-siri-revamp,Technology

"Apple prepares iOS 19, macOS 16 'Solarium' UI overhaul for WWDC","Apple is preparing to modernize the appearance of iOS 19, macOS 16, and its other operating systems, with a new ""Solarium"" interface set to be introduced at WWDC.

Apple's keynote address at WWDC is a few short weeks away, and speculation about what it will launch is gathering pace. When it comes to how the operating systems appear, users could be greeted by an overhauled UI.

According to Sunday's ""Power On"" newsletter from Bloomberg, Apple will be introducing a UI interface known internally as ""Solarium."" The name, which refers to rooms that let in lots of sunlight through glass windows, is reportedly going to be a slicker and modern reinvention of the interfaces in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

Previous rumors claimed that iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 would get some of the design cues from visionOS. This seems to fit in with the ""Solarium"" UI name.

Visual Consistency

An apparent theme for WWDC 2025 will be consistency and unification. This should mean that users will experience similar interfaces, UI elements, and maybe even features, when they use the same functions across different devices and operating systems.

This theme apparently means that it won't just be a change limited to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Allegedly, tvOS and watchOS will have their own redesigns to match the other updates, while visionOS will get its own adjustments to fit.

In April, a leaker offered what the updates to iOS 19 could look like, based on it incorporating visionOS elements. In a video, frosted glass elements, rounder squircle icons in the Home Screen, and more floating UI elements were considered the main features of the new UI.

There has been some intense discussion between leakers over the UI updates and what to actually expect. Regardless of who is closer to the truth, an update to the appearance of Apple's operating systems is expected, and long overdue.",https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/05/25/apple-prepares-ios-19-macos-16-solarium-ui-overhaul-for-wwdc,Technology
Can diamond quantum sensors work inside living cells? Study says yes,"Using a special shell, which is also used in QLED screens, they transformed ordinary diamond nanoparticles into advanced quantum sensors that can work inside living cells. This innovation could revolutionize how we monitor cellular health and detect diseases early.

“This work provides a foundational advancement in nanoscale quantum sensing, with implications for precision diagnostics, cellular imaging, and other bioengineering applications,” the researcher noted in their study.

The performance issue with nanodiamonds

Scientists have long known that special defects in diamonds, called nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, can act like tiny quantum sensors. These NV centers are very sensitive to changes in magnetic fields, temperature, and electric signals, making them perfect for detecting what’s happening inside living cells or deep within materials.

However, there was a problem. To get diamonds inside a cell, they have to be made incredibly small—nanodiamonds, less than 100 nanometers wide. At this tiny scale, the NV centers stop working well. Their quantum signals fade, and they no longer behave like the precise sensors scientists need.",https://interestingengineering.com/science/diamond-quantum-sensors-for-living-cells,Technology
Furniture brand shocks industry with futuristic innovation that destroys its own products: 'We wanted to get to the next level',"If self-cannibalizing furniture sounds far-fetched, think again: A new ingredient in plastic is making that a reality.

After years of experimenting with sustainable alternatives to conventional plastic, high-end plastic furniture maker Heller has introduced an enzyme to accelerate the decomposition process. Fast Company reported on the development, which marks a revolutionary milestone for both the furniture industry and the future of plastic waste.

The enzyme, which is mixed into the plastic in powdered form, essentially turns the plastic into something appetizing for microorganisms to eat, accelerating a naturally occurring process. It was developed by the research company Worry Free Plastics.

Advertisement Advertisement

Crucially for the indoor-outdoor furniture maker, the enzyme only activates when the furniture is in a zero-oxygen environment — such as a landfill, the ocean, or even soil. From day to day, it remains solid; in a zero-oxygen environment, according to the company, it will degrade in approximately five years.

This is an incredible improvement on the typical decomposition of plastic, as a piece of plastic can take up to 500 years to degrade, per the United Nations. Even then, it just breaks down into microplastics and chemicals, contaminating the water and soil in its surroundings.

When microorganisms process this plastic, the only byproduct is biogas and nutrient-rich soil — and it happens on a remarkably quick timeline. Worry Free Plastics estimates that its enzyme could help a plastic bottle degrade in approximately seven and a half years and a plastic bag in five.

John Edelman, president and CEO of Heller, said that simply looking at recycled plastics wasn't enough to meet the company's environmental goals. ""We wanted to get to the next level and become more sustainable,"" he said, per Fast Company. ""How can we be good for the planet and create incredible design?""

Advertisement Advertisement

Even better for consumers, the new biodegradability won't change the price tag. ""It's a drop-in technology,"" said Philip Myers, Worry Free Plastics co-founder. ""It doesn't require them to change their equipment, their process — anything. It's plug and play.""

Heller introduced the enzyme to its production line in November, and the company expects the new products to completely replace old inventory in the coming months to years.

""My goal is to do something that is sustainable and at the same price,"" Edelman said. ""We actually achieved our goal of not just using recycled products, not just being recyclable, but going back to the earth.""

If self-destroying plastic isn't available, opting for plastic-free alternatives for everyday products is a great way to reduce your own plastic pollution and help create a cleaner world.

Google Chrome Adds One-Click Automated Password Change Feature for Compromised Accounts,"Google Chrome is introducing a new automated password change capability within its built-in Password Manager, enabling users to update compromised passwords with a single click. The feature, currently in development, builds upon Chrome’s existing AI-powered password security features and marks a significant advancement in automated credential protection.

The enhancement expands Google Password Manager’s existing capabilities, which include generating secure passwords during account creation and identifying credentials exposed in data breaches. The latest development follows Google’s recent introduction of bulk management features for passwords and passkeys, showing the company’s ongoing commitment to strengthening user security.

When Chrome detects a compromised password during sign-in, the Password Manager will present users with an option to automatically update it. The automated approach significantly streamlines the security response process compared to traditional manual password changes, particularly important given the increasing frequency of data breaches.

Website developers can implement support for this feature by using specific autocomplete attributes and establishing a redirect from a standardized URL for password changes. “It would be much easier if password managers could navigate the user directly to the change-password URL,” said Eiji Kitamura. “This is where a well-known URL for changing passwords becomes useful.”

The feature was initially discovered in developer builds of Chrome Canary within the “AI Innovations” settings menu, though the specific role of artificial intelligence in the process has not been detailed. The integration follows Chrome’s broader push toward AI-enhanced security features, including automated SMS verification code detection and enhanced biometric authentication for password autofill.

Google plans to complete the full rollout of the automated password change capability in late 2025, with aims to expand compatibility across a broader range of websites. The development represents an evolution in browser-based security features, building upon existing password management capabilities while reducing the manual effort traditionally required for maintaining secure credentials following security incidents.

Garmin drops another Connect+ exclusive in the May 2025 update,"What you need to know

Garmin just dropped a big update packed with fresh features for hikers, athletes, and health buffs alike.

New features include smarter health tracking, tougher security, and handy outdoor tools like Garmin Trails for easy trail hunting.

Rucking finally gets its own mode—with a pack weight setting that makes your stats like VO2 max and calories burned way more accurate.

Garmin has quietly pushed out a major update to some of its best smartwatches, and it’s not your average tune-up. If you’re into hiking trails, crushing workouts, or just keeping an eye on your health, there’s a bunch of new features here for everyone.

This update is loaded with upgrades from smarter health tracking and beefed-up security to nifty tools for finding your way outdoors. Highlights include sleep breathing insights, a new rucking mode for weighted treks, a fine-tuned stage timer for shooting sports, and some upgrades for golf and trail features.

Rucking isn’t just a workout, it’s a lifestyle for a lot of adventurers. But until now, Garmin watches didn’t really get it. They’d log it like a normal hike, which messed with stats like VO2 max since moving slower with extra weight looked like you were out of shape. With the new pack weight option, your watch finally understands the grind.

Just toss in your pack’s weight, and your watch dials in your stats so things like VO2 max and calories burned actually reflect the real effort you’re putting in.

The new rucking feature is now live on both Instinct 3 models (standard and Tactical), the Fenix 8 lineup, Enduro 3, Forerunner 570, and Forerunner 970.

Ruck mode unlocked

At the same time, this update also brings breathing variation tracking to a bunch of watches, including the Vivoactive, Venu, Lily, and several Forerunner models. However, older Forerunners like the now-retired 265 and 965 won’t be getting the new rucking features.

On top of the new rucking mode, you’ll now be able to add your pack’s weight to running, trail running, hiking, and walking profiles too—at least on the supported watch models.

This update means way more accurate stats, like VO2 max, calories burned, and elevation, especially when you’re hauling serious weight on your adventures.

There’s also a new ""Breathing Variations"" feature that taps into Pulse Ox data to give you a closer look at how your breathing shifts during sleep.

On top of that, this update spreads device passcodes to more watches that didn’t have them before. While the newer Venu, Vivoactive, and Forerunner models got passcodes earlier this year, now the Lily 2, Instinct 3, and Instinct E series are joining them.

For all you marksmen out there, Garmin has added a new Stage Timer that keeps you in the zone with real-time alerts, either blasting through your watch speaker or quietly via your hearing protection.

If you’re on Garmin Connect+ or Outdoor Maps+, there’s a sweet new upgrade: Garmin Trails. It’s a smart trail finder built right into Garmin Connect and Explore to help you discover your next adventure without the guesswork.

Before you dive into the update, double-check that your watch is on the list of compatible models.",https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-drops-another-connect-exclusive-in-the-may-2025-update,Technology

"Google’s finally showing off its new ‘G’ logo more, but it’s still not quite done yet","Summary Google has subtly updated its iconic 'G' logo for the first time since 2015 a couple of days ago.

The rollout has been oddly staggered, with the iOS app receiving the new logo before Android, and many places, like the Pixel Launcher, still showing the old version.

The new logo now appears in more places, including the Google.com favicon, the Search bar widget, and throughout the Google app’s interface, as seen during the recent I/O keynote.

A colorful 'G' icon is synonymous with only one company, and that's Google. Given that the Mountain View-based giant last updated its icon in 2015, it was due for a much-needed refresh, which it got just a couple of days ago (as spotted by u/Eyal-M on Reddit).

However, unlike other companies that choose to massively revamp their logos (and sometimes end up losing their entire identity), Google decided to take the smarter route. It made a subtle change to the logo, but it wasn't too subtle. In fact, it was just the right amount of subtle: enough for you to immediately tell it’s Google at first glance, but also enough to notice that something isn’t quite right and that something’s different.

What’s a bit strange is that despite it being Google's own icon change, the iOS app got the new icon first instead of Android, like one would expect and even then, only in the beta version. A couple of days after debuting it on iOS, the company then rolled it out to the Google app on Android. But even then, it didn’t talk about it publicly or bother updating the icon online.

Well, until now. Google finally rolled the icon out more widely, but yet again, decided to pick and choose which places get the upgrade.

If you haven't seen it yet, the new Google icon ditches solid colors in favor of gradient colors. In the new logo, the red bleeds into yellow, which bleeds into green, which bleeds into blue. It's a bit hard to tell in the favicon, especially if you aren't looking at it too closely, but the image we've attached below should help.

As first reported by 9to5Google, Google's new 'G' logo has now made its way to Google Web. Now, when you head to google.com, the little 'G' logo in the tab, which is called the favicon, has been replaced from the old one to the new one.

Even though the favicon has been updated, search results from Google’s own websites, like google.com, images.google.com, and accounts.google.com, still show the old icon.

Google debuted its new icon quietly and decided to update the iOS app's icon out of the blue, with no prior warning or word from the company itself. However, Google's new gradient logo appeared right on stage during this year's I/O keynote, held earlier this week.

The Google app's Search bar homescreen widget has also been updated with the new icon, and the AI Mode too has the new logo on display at the top.

Similarly, you'll also spot more instances of the refreshed Google icon in the app itself, which wasn’t the case when Google first updated the icon. For instance, in the iOS app, when you search something and the results appear on the next page, the new G logo shows up in the top-left corner.

Strangely, Google is still yet to ship the new icon to the Pixel Launcher search bar. That’ll probably change soon though. What’s weird is that Google chose to roll this minor change out in phases, but Google is just going to... Google.",https://www.androidpolice.com/googles-logo-rolling-out-widely/,Technology
The Nintendo Switch 2 sure seems to work just fine with a USB mouse,"is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

You’ll be able to use a USB mouse with the Nintendo Switch 2 in at least one game, as a Koei Tecmo developer commentary video for the upcoming Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition revealed this week. That’s great news if your wrists, like mine, started preemptively cramping the first time you saw video of someone tipping a Joy-Con 2 controller on its edge for mouse mode.

While demonstrating the game’s use of the Joy-Con 2 as a mouse, producer Michi Ryu stops and plugs in a USB mouse. The Switch 2 displays a message that says a mouse has been connected, and he continues to play with both a mouse and his left Joy-Con 2, switching between them seamlessly, the same way you’ll be able to go back and forth between gyro and mouse control in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.

As VideoGamesChronicle notes, the original Switch had mouse and keyboard support, though only some games took advantage, like the Nightdive-developed Turok port. (If you own that game and never noticed the “Mouse” option in its input settings, go plug in a USB mouse and keyboard and try it out — you won’t want to go back.)

A mouse on a Nintendo console menu! GIF: Nintendo Today app

This time around, Nintendo is embracing mouse support more. For instance, the company published a video to its Nintendo Today app earlier this month, showing that when you put a Joy-Con 2 on its edge for mouse mode, an onscreen pointer appears for navigating the system’s menu.

So does the Nobunaga’s Ambition video, mean a standard mouse works interchangeably with a Joy-Con 2 controller anywhere where mouse control is supported? I sure hope so, but we don’t know that yet. And Nintendo didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s email asking if that was the case.",https://www.theverge.com/news/674176/nintendo-switch-2-usb-mouse-support,Technology

VLC can do that? 5 advanced tricks you never use,"VLC is my go-to media app because it plays all media. I've been using it for years and never worry about compatibility because it can handle every video or audio file format. It's superior to Windows Media Player and easily beats many open-source alternatives despite its dated appearance because of its superior functionality.

While most of us use VLC to watch movies or listen to music, it's packed with hidden features that elevate it to a media powerhouse. It can edit files and includes other seldom-used functions that will blow your mind. I learned about many of these recently and thought I'd share my experience of five advanced VLC tricks you never use.

5 Remove audio

Perfect for streamers

Close

VLC can remove the audio from video files, making it ideal for streamers and other content creators who want to create clips of movies or shows. This feature removes the video's audio codec, and it will play normally, but without sound. The process isn't reversible, so keeping the original file is advisable because you might need it later.

Removing audio is simple with VLC's Convert/Save tool. Click on Media, then click on the Convert/Save button. The Open Media Window will open. Click on Add and navigate to the file from which you want to remove the audio. Click on the Convert/Save button, then the wrench icon in the Convert Window. You must click on the Audio Codec tab in the Profile Edition window. You can then uncheck the Audio tab and click on Save.

4 Convert video formats

Create any file type

Close

VLC takes file conversion to another level by converting videos into other formats for easy editing. Certain apps might not be able to read your video formats, and you can easily convert them to alternatives like MP4, TS, OGG, or ASF. You can also check the encapsulation settings beforehand to see if the format includes chapters, subtitles, and other features.

Converting video formats is similar to removing audio. You'll need to click on Media and then click the Convert/Save button. Then click Add in the Open Media window to map the file's location. The Convert window will open, and you must select a video output option from the Profile dropdown menu. Click on Browse to select an output destination for the file, then click Start to convert the file.

3 Hotkeys

Quick access media shortcuts

Close

I have an old laptop connected to my TV and use a wireless mouse and keyboard to access apps and media files. VLC's Hotkeys function lets me access all its features from my couch with simple keyboard shortcuts. It makes my life easier because I don't need to stress about using a mouse, which can be challenging without a flat surface.

Hotkeys are activated by default, but you'll need to navigate to Tools -> Preferences -> Hotkeys to see what each key does. The extensive list provides shortcuts for commonly used functions like play, pause, and full-screen mode. It also offers quick access to more advanced features like short, medium, and long jumps forward and backward, as well as selecting playlists. If you don't like the preset key configurations, I can easily remap them to something easier to remember by double-clicking on the hotkey and clicking on Unset. You can then type the new shortcut key, and the system will save it.

2 Toolbars editor

Customize the functions

Close

VLC often gets flak for its boring interface, which hasn't changed in years. Most people are unaware that they can customize the interface and move the buttons to other positions to create a personalized menu. To do this, you'll need to click on Tools -> Customize Interface. The Toolbars Editor window will open, displaying all the VLC interface buttons, and you can drag and drop them to move them around.

The feature lets you change the Main VLC toolbar by default. You can edit other menus by clicking the Time Toolbar, Advanced Widgets, and Fullscreen Controller tabs. Ticking the Toolbar position checkbox moves the default toolbar position above the video instead of below it.

1 Add custom skins

Free visual upgrades

Close

Adding skins to VLC updates its standard appearance with a fresh, more exciting look. Many skins are available, but you must download them from the official VideoLAN website or third-party alternatives, like DeviantArt. After finding the skins you like, you'll need to download them onto your PC as .vlt files.

You can copy these files into VLC's skins folder. It's located in C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\skins on my PC, but it may be different from yours depending on the app version and your OS. For the next step, navigate to Tools -> Preferences -> Interface and tick the Use custom skin checkbox under Look and Feel. Then navigate to the skin you'd like to use in the VLC installation folder and click Save to apply it.

Huawei Pura 80 Ultra tipped to launch with huge dual periscope zoom camera hump,"The Pura 80 Ultra is tipped to launch as Huawei's most advanced camera smartphone to date for a number of reasons. Now, its shooters are thought to have what might be the brand's largest rear panel-mounted housing ever. They are also now believed to pack an on-trend zoom solution.

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

The Pura 80 Ultra will debut with an exaggerated version of its predecessor's distinctive, vaguely triangular camera hump, according to a number of images posted to social media recently.

Some of them allegedly show reviewers comparing a number of smartphones, some of which are concealed in anti-paparazzi cases that still fail to entirely conceal their extremely large and pronounced camera humps.

Those images may or may not be corroborated by a (blurry, yet often artificially enhanced) snap allegedly showing the Huawei executive He Gang holding a new smartphone that might indeed be an updated version of the Pura 70 Ultra with the lenses in the same places.

Most of these leaks reportedly originate on the Fixed Focus Digital Weibo channel, although they were also subsequently uploaded to X by @rajAnoop_ following their removal from the former platform.

The 80 Ultra is thus now believed to have triple rear cameras, (augmented with a new ""Red Maple"" multi-spectral sensor), 2 of which are now thought to have periscope zoom lenses.

Both sensors are said to be 50MP and to support the OEM's RYYB technology - which could mean that at least 1 of them could be a world-first Huawei self-developed sensor with SuperPixGain HDR 2.0.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-Pura-80-Ultra-tipped-to-launch-with-huge-dual-periscope-zoom-camera-hump.1023895.0.html,Technology

The Dimensity 9500 is tipped to debut the latest and possibly greatest silicon technology from Arm's, based on the firm's latest v9 architecture.

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

The Dimensity 9400+ is currently MediaTek's flagship mobile processor and boasts the fastest version of Arm's most powerful Cortex-X925 core. Now, the SoC's successor is thought to outdo it with bleeding-edge tech the same chipset IP firm has to offer.

The typically knowledgeable leaker Fixed Focus Digital claims to have heard that the 9500 will upgrade to the core to come after the X925, which was credited with performance boosts of up to 36% compared to its own predecessor the X4.

The putative ""X1025"" is projected to be based on the latest version of Arm's v9 architecture (although the same can be said of the X925).

The 9500 could, therefore, also be the first platform with a successor to MediaTek's Immortalis G925 GPU.

The processor is already projected to power next-gen premium handsets such as the Oppo Find X9, Vivo X300, and Honor Magic8 Mini.

"Deals: Galaxy S24 FE and A56 get a free watch, Poco X7 and F7 prices fall","Samsung is running a “Sweet Summertime Upgrade” promotion, meaning that several Galaxy models are paired with a free Galaxy Watch7. The two we picked are the S24 FE and A56.

The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is £100 off at the moment and seeing how the 256GB variant is only £60 more than the 128GB one, that’s the one we’d recommend – storage is non-expandable and 128GB is pretty tight.

The phone’s Exynos 2400e is pretty zippy and the 50+8+12MP camera setup includes a 75mm 3x telephoto camera. The battery situation is typical for Samsung with 5,000mAh capacity and 25W wired charging, but at least you also get 15W wireless – that and the tele camera are pretty rare for this price range. That and the promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.

The Samsung Galaxy A56 is almost £180 cheaper for the same 8/256GB configuration. However, the 2400e is 70-80% faster (sometimes more) than the Exynos 1580, so these savings come at a cost – and that cost includes losing the tele camera. There’s faster 45W wired charging for the slightly larger 5,000mAh battery (vs. 4,700mAh on the FE), but there is no wireless charging. The A56 will receive 6 years of support, but since it is one year newer than the S24 FE, support for both will end around the same time.

And here is the freebie that comes with both phones, the Samsung Galaxy Watch7. By the looks of it, you can only get the 40mm model – that is just north of £200 right now (£290 MSRP). It has a 1.3” display and a 300mAh battery. You can read more about the offer and claim the watch here.

As a reminder, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is launching next week. During the pre-order period you get a free storage upgrade to 512GB, £100 Samsung Credit and now Amazon has added a £100 discount for Prime Student members that wasn’t there last week.

The Poco X7 Pro price has fallen to £240 for the base 8/256GB model and £270 for the 12/512GB (a worthy upgrade for just £30). Three weeks ago those prices were £285 and £327, respectively.

The vanilla Poco X7 is a bit cheaper too, but the Pro model is better value for money. You lose a lot of performance going from a Dimensity 8400 Ultra with UFS 4.0 storage (X7 Pro) to Dimensity 7300 Ultra with UFS 2.2 storage (X7). The GPU in particular is in another class. You also lose battery capacity (5,110mAh vs. 6,000mAh) and charge speed (45W vs. 90W) and that does affect battery performance.

The Poco F7 Pro is noticeably pricier (£160 more) than the X7 Pro but its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is only marginally faster. There are other upgrades like the screen resolution (1440p+ vs. 1220p+), main camera sensor size (1/1.55” vs. 1/1.95”) and Wi-Fi 7, but the price premium can be hard to justify.

Finally, the Poco F7 Ultra price is where it was last week – another £160 upcharge. However, you get the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, plus a 50MP 2.5x/60mm telephoto camera and a higher resolution 32MP ultra-wide (vs. 8MP).

The 5,300mAh battery is smaller, but it supports both 120W wired and 50W wireless charging. Despite the seemingly large difference in capacity, battery life ends up being about the same. Check out our Poco F7 Pro vs. F7 Ultra article for camera samples and more details on how these two compare.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 will be powered by the familiar Exynos W1000 chip,"The Galaxy Watch8 series is right around the corner. As far as we currently know, it will drop in early July alongside the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7. We already know quite a bit about the Watch8, and the latest industry chatter claims that Samsung will reuse its own Exynos W1000 chip from last year.

The Exynos W1000 is still a top dog in the smartwatch realm. It is effectively one of the fastest, if not the fastest, watch chip with its penta-core CPU setup, consisting of four ARM Cortex-A55 cores, clocked at up to 1.5 GHz and a Cortex-A78, working at up to 1.6 GHz. A Mali-G68 MP2 GPU and fast LPDDR5 RAM accompany it. The W1000 is manufactured using a very efficient 3nm GAA process.

As for other info, we currently believe that the Galaxy Watch8 series will see the return of the Classic model. The Watch8 Classic has leaked in renders with a “squircle” case design very much reminiscent of the Galaxy Watch Ultra. Apparently, both the vanilla Watch8 and the Watch8 Classic will have the same case shape.

Other alleged specs for the Watch8 Classic include a 46/47mm size with a 1.5” screen diagonal, which works out to 46 x 46.5 x 14.2 mm. We are expecting a 450 mAh battery and likely One UI 8 Watch, based on Wear OS 6.

"My first contact with ESXi has left me bamboozled, frustrated, and disappointed","Proxmox may be the head honcho in the home lab ecosystem now, but things were radically different in the past. For years, the home server community heralded ESXi as its virtualization platform of choice. Unfortunately, ESXi’s time in the limelight was cut short after Broadcom removed the free version of the hypervisor last year. Fast-forward to April 2025, and for some reason, the company decided to reinstate the ESXi free license.

As someone who couldn’t experience ESXi in its golden days, I wanted to see what the fuss was all about and grabbed the VMware VMvisor installer the very day it made a comeback. But after spending days with the virtualization platform, I have to admit that it was a major disappointment for a couple of reasons.

Atrocious NIC support

Good luck finding an affordable NIC that works with ESXi

Server-oriented OS are infamous for their high system requirements and limited hardware compatibility. However, ESXi takes this issue to the next level with its terrible support for Ethernet controllers, and I’m not referring to just consumer-grade NICs. Unless your system is armed with specific Ethernet Controller(s) from Intel, your experience will be as terrible as mine.

The first rig I used for the hypervisor (yeah, I tested multiple devices in my home lab with ESXi) included an ASRock B550 Phantom Gaming motherboard. While it’s an AM4 mobo that hinges on the budget-friendly end, I’ve run Proxmox, XCP-ng, and (Unix-based) SmartOS on the PC without encountering compatibility issues in the past. Unfortunately, the ESXi installation wizard failed to detect the NIC, instead throwing the No network adapters error in the middle of the setup project.

Next, I tried plugging two 10 Gigabit TX-401 Ethernet cards and repeated the installation process. But as luck would have it, ESXi wouldn’t play nice with the NICs either. Switching to my USB-to-Ethernet adapter had the same outcome, so it was time to pull out the other systems in my home lab.

Close

The TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus NAS was the second device to undergo the ESXi installation process. After disabling the option to boot into TerraMaster’s TOS in the BIOS, I arrived at the ESXi installation screen. But my hopes of running the virtualization platform on a prebuilt NAS were dashed when ESXi refused to work with the Ethernet adapter on the F8 SSD Plus. So, I decided to pull out its bigger, bulkier cousin, the F4-424 Max, though the outcome was no different.

Close

Finally, I turned my attention to my Xeon-powered Proxmox workstation. Seeing how the rig was designed for server distros, I figured ESXi would detect the NIC on the dual CPU motherboard. Alas, the ESXi continued to display the same error, though I had one last ace up my sleeve.

Close

My ZimaBoard 2 SBC uses an Intel-based Ethernet controller, and since I had nothing to lose besides another 30 minutes, I figured I could try one last-ditch attempt at installing the hypervisor. After repeating the same procedure for the umpteenth time, I was finally free from the scourge of the No Ethernet adapters error, and quickly followed the rest of the steps to set up ESXi before my luck took a turn for the worse.

Its UI is fairly intuitive

Actually, it’s the only decent thing about the hypervisor

Close

With the ESXi server finally up and running, it was time to tinker with its UI. Credit where it’s due, ESXi has a sleek and professional-looking interface, truly befitting an OS that’s used by data centers and enterprises. While I adore Proxmox to bits, ESXi’s UI is a lot less cluttered than its rival’s, and you don’t have to go through a series of menus just to upload ISO files.

Deploying virtual machines is just as simple, and the same can be said about editing storage and network settings. ESXi also provides the option to add a VMware Tools disk to virtual guests, thereby enhancing their performance and providing you with some extra QoL features. Unfortunately, that’s where the perks end, because the free version of ESXi is excessively (sorry, terrible rhyme) neutered – to the point where it can’t hold a candle to the extra functionality packed into most FOSS virtualization platforms.

Paywalled features make it terrible for home labs

I’d rather allocate more than eight cores to a VM, thank you

Although consumer-grade hardware has a limited number of cores, server rigs are loaded with extra cores and threads. That’s before you include dual CPU systems featuring twice the core and thread count.

However, the free copy of ESXi has a hard cap of eight CPU cores per virtual machine. Don’t get me wrong, you can definitely use all the CPU cores in your ESXi platform; it’s just that you can’t assign any more than eight of them to individual VMs. While 2-4 cores should be more than enough for light Linux VMs, you’ll want all the processing horsepower to deploy Windows, macOS, or even other virtualization platforms on your workstation. So, if you’re planning to create a 16-core Hackintosh using ESXi, you’ll have to grab a paid copy of the hypervisor.

No support for high-availability setups, either

As if the hardware issues and max CPU core cap per VM weren’t bad enough, ESXi’s free model doesn’t ship with cluster provisions. That’s a real buzzkill for advanced home lab setups, especially considering that Proxmox, XCP-ng, Harvester, and other platforms have this facility built into them.

Sure, a casual home labber may not find a lot of utility in running multiple ESXi instances. But if you’re looking for high-availability provisions or want to tinker with live migration and other DevOps topics, you’ll be sorely disappointed with ESXi.

Then there’s the whole controversy with the free license

Before I wrap this article up by concluding that ESXi is no longer the hotshot it used to be, I’ll address the elephant in the room. Remember how Broadcom rescinded the license out of nowhere? An anti-consumer move of that magnitude is enough to deter even my nerdy self from relying on ESXi. And who’s to say that Broadcom won’t do so again in the future?

For folks looking to build a dedicated home lab with the free version of the tool, I’d recommend practically any distro, platform, or OS over it. Of course, ESXi is still a driving force in the professional world. If you’re a DevOps enthusiast or seek a career in the sysadmin field, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with ESXi. I suggest using nested virtualization to deploy an ESXi virtual machine inside Proxmox, which is, ironically, the most painless way to tinker with the hypervisor. But that's a story for another time...",https://www.xda-developers.com/my-first-contact-with-esxi-has-left-me-disappointed/,Technology

4 reasons I use ZFS snapshots on my NAS — and so should you,"When building out your network-attached storage (NAS) enclosure or working with a few home lab servers, it's vital you get the filesystem right. The choice of filesystem depends on what you plan on using the system for and how you plan to go about backing up all the data. ZFS is a favorite among many for NAS and data storage, thanks to its robust feature set, namely snapshots. This handy addition to the file system makes it among the best for storing data, and I've relied on it for years to keep my servers up and running.

4 Enhanced data protection

Works well with RAID

Close

ZFS is absolutely brilliant for storing data. When configuring a ZFS-based storage pool, end-to-end checksums are created for both the data and metadata. This allows the file system to check for errors within the data, and should any corruption be detected, attempts are made to repair the data with mirrored datasets. Then you've got periodic scrubs that can be set up to check data integrity and prevent bit rot from damaging anything stored on the NAS. This is vital since you could start to lose files without realizing it.

Snapshots take this a step further by allowing you to quickly recover when files are accidentally deleted or any corruption is detected, but somehow missed by the automated checks. You can restore files to a previous version and take advantage of the compressed nature of snapshots, in that not much additional headroom is required to get the most out of ZFS. You likely won't need to use the snapshots to recover from data loss with ZFS running with a healthy 3-2-1 backup strategy, but it's good to have if needed.

Related I prefer RAID 10 over other configurations RAID, or Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks, is often synonymous with NAS devices and storage servers, and for good reason. So long as you've got the drives to spare, you can leverage the different RAID configurations to increase the speed and fault tolerance of your server. Personally, I'm fond of RAID 10, as it combines the fast speeds of a striped (RAID 0) setup with the resilience of a mirrored (RAID 1) configuration. With an an extra offsite backup, it should be pretty durable, unless two drives from the same mirror set happen to fail simultaneously. I'm also eyeing RAID 6 since it can tolerate failures of up to two drives, though the slow speeds of parity drives make me a little apprehensive about running it in my server. But what about you? Which RAID configuration is your favorite?

3 Ability to roll back in time

Back to the past!

Close

Instead of Back to the Future, we're rolling Back to the Past with ZFS snapshots. With them correctly configured, you can roll back an entire file system to a point in time when everything was running smoothly. So long as it was captured by a snapshot, you can revert to an earlier save point, much like you would in a video game. It's useful, reliable, and powerful when working with data before having to resort to full-size backup restoration. If I can quickly revert content locally without involving the LAN, I can minimize downtime.

It's also good for those times when I mistakenly alter something that somehow manages to break everything.

Related I always use ZFS on my NAS and home lab servers for this vital reason Struggling to choose a file system to use on your NAS or home lab server? Use ZFS!

2 More efficient backups

No more wasted data

Close

Snapshots aren't like traditional backups, where an entire dataset is copied somewhere at set intervals, replacing the prior saved copy. Instead, they provide a point-in-time copy of the file system, offering a consistent way to return to an earlier backup without having to fetch physical hardware or work through large data dumps. Snapshots within ZFS take up minimal space, thanks to the use of copy-on-write technology, meaning space is only used when data is written, making them incredibly efficient for even larger datasets.

And because of their nature, snapshots can be quickly created, making them a much better solution for frequent backups where not everything needs to be saved. Think of it like backing up all your data, but selecting only files that have had changes made, and storing this backup somewhere else so as not to overwrite previous versions on backup locations.

1 Easier testing and troubleshooting

See what worked before

Close

Snapshots are also better than standard backups for testing out changes. A snapshot can be created before making any system alterations, allowing you to test out new configurations or software without risking breaking everything. A simple restore point can make it easy to revert to a prior system state, undoing anything you did that caused issues in the first place. It's fantastic for troubleshooting too, with the ability to help you identify the root cause of a particular problem.

And if you ever make a mistake, which you will, snapshots can be quickly deployed to recover from errors or accidental removals.

Get the most out of ZFS (and your NAS)

Setting up your NAS with ZFS storage pools is easy, especially if you use an operating system designed for it. I'm a big proponent of TrueNAS and its Scale OS, which is designed around ZFS and making the most out of the file system. TrueNAS is pretty easy to get used to, is powerful enough for data storage, and can even run numerous apps and Docker containers, allowing you to make your NAS slightly more versatile. Once you configure everything, it's an easy OS (with ZFS) to set and forget.",https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-use-zfs-snapshots-on-my-nas/,Technology
Real-world map data is helping make better games about farms and transportation,"I’m feeling a strange sense of pressure as I set up my first bus route in City Bus Manager. I want to get things right for the public transportation users of this city, probably because it’s the city I actually live in. City Bus Manager uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to populate its maps, so I can see all the familiar streets and points of interest laid out in front of me. These are my neighbors, who, like me, want an efficient transit service. I want to be able to provide it to them — even if only in a simulation.

City Bus Manager is part of a small group of management sims that are using OSM’s community-generated database to make the whole world their game setting. Other examples include Global Farmer, NIMBY Rails, and Logistical: Earth. In these games, players can build farms, railways, or delivery networks all over the globe, using data about real fields, settlements, and infrastructure to inform their decisions.

When the idea of using OSM was first raised at PeDePe, the studio behind City Bus Manager, “we had no idea if it would be technically feasible,” says Niklas Polster, the studio’s co-founder. But once established, the license gave them access to an entire world of streets, buildings, and even real bus stops. And these do more than just form the game’s world. They’re also used for gameplay elements like simulating passenger behavior. “Schools generate traffic in the mornings on weekdays, while nightlife areas such as bars and clubs tend to attract more passengers in the evenings on weekends,” ” Polster says.

Typically, Polster says, people are drawn to playing City Bus Manager in their local areas. (This seems to be confirmed by looking at YouTube playthroughs of the game, where creators often begin by saying they’re going to dive into their own city or town.) That personal connection appears almost hardwired into people, says Thorsten Feldmann, CEO of Global Farmer developer Thera Bytes. When they showcased the game at Gamescom in 2024, “every single booth visitor” wanted to input their own postal code and look at their own house.

There’s a specific fantasy about being able to transform a space you know so well, Feldmann says. In addition to your own home or town, the marketing for Global Farmer suggests using famous tourist locations, such as Buckingham Palace, as the beginning of your new agricultural life. “[Players creating their] own stories around those places can be even more impactful than in purely fictional environments,” Feldmann says.

There is something inherently fun about being in control of a place you see every day or one that is deeply iconic. In particular, tearing down a perfectly manicured gated garden from which the British royal family takes £510 million per year and turning it into land to grow food for a country where 4.5 million children live in poverty might not be a one-to-one political solution, but it is emotionally compelling.

“We’ve heard stories of players who became interested in public transport as a career thanks to the game.”

The quality — or lack thereof — of public transportation is another key political topic where I live. The local buses are currently in the process of being nationalized again after what South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard calls a “failed experiment” in privatization. Maybe that’s why, even though these might just be pixels on a screen, I want to do it right. That’s a feeling many players seem to experience. “Our Discord community is full of players who are passionate about public transport,” Polster says. “We’ve heard stories of players who became interested in public transport as a career thanks to the game.”

Of course, game developers using OSM data are still making games, rather than exact simulations. The real world is not always a well-balanced game design space. “In smaller towns and villages, routes can be unprofitable with realistic numbers,” Polster says. City Bus Manager compensates for this by giving players more financial support, which is a straightforward and useful bit of game design. But when it comes to treating the games as direct representations of the world, it elides some complexity. For example, according to Polster, some players have reached out to their local transportation agencies with data they’ve gathered from playing in their local areas — despite the fact that the game is not actually designed as a faithful recreation of the real world, even if its map is.

Another challenge is that OSM data isn’t always fully reliable. Polster explains that there can be errors or missing data that break very specific areas in the game, requiring PeDePe to manually find the issues and fix them. But OSM is also a volunteer-run program, meaning players can correct the data at the source. “Many of our players contribute directly to OpenStreetMap,” if they find errors in their local area, Polster says, which improves the dataset for everybody, no matter what they’re using it for.

Density of data is also a particular issue for the Global Farmer developers, who found that OSM has a lot more information about roads than field systems. There are plenty of areas where individual field boundaries aren’t mapped, making “total grey areas where gameplay actually couldn’t happen.” The developers compensated for this by making a map editor, where players can copy satellite images from other sources to correct the data, but it means that those who don’t want to build their own maps are limited to the places where OSM has detailed data or where other players have shared their creations.

Management sims have often reached for a sense of realism, and OSM data is a useful tool in that toolbox. It also allows players to control environments they know well and can connect with. But it is not a perfect recreation of the world, and even if it was, that isn’t always what games need. According to Feldmann, navigating these factors “can be very frustrating.”

But, just like players, developers are drawn to the idea of blurring the lines between places they know and places they simulate. “It is also super rewarding whenever you manage to find a solution and get great results that are connected to the real world,” Feldmann says.",https://www.theverge.com/games/672035/openstreetmap-data-games,Technology
Xbox gamers delighted by massive new free game drop: 'let's go',"Xbox now has a big games drop for you to enjoy, and fans are over the moon.

This week, Xbox launched its new Retro Classics app, a library of old games for you to enjoy with your Game Pass subscription.

When we say retro library, we don’t mean Resident Evil 2 or Final Fantasy 6 (typing that made me feel old), but the real classics.

We’re talking Zork, or Police Quest, or MechWarrior.

Advert

It’s a good chance for gamers to discover (or rediscover) those old gems that they otherwise wouldn’t have heard of.

I mean, some of these games are nearly 50 years old by now.

“Finally I can play Zork from the comfort of my couch without having to start up Call of Duty: Black Ops,” wrote one comment on Reddit.

This is a joke pointing to the fact that the original Black Ops game had an Easter egg where you could play Zork from the main menu.

Advert

Another comment wrote: “This just continues to make Game Pass a more compelling product. Neat stuff.”

“MechWarrior 2 was my first PC game as a kid,” another comment wrote. “I wanna play five now. I hope it’s good.”

The whole Reddit thread is full of more commenters reminiscing about games they played when they were younger. It’s well worth a read if you have similar nostalgia.

Out of the list, which has been compiled by PureXbox, I’ve played a few of these myself. I remember playing Atlantis on an old home computer, and I’ve certainly played River Raid too.

Advert

But there are a bunch here I've never even heard of, so it'd be great to have a way to check them out.

This new release from Xbox should hopefully kickstart a new interest in retro gaming, especially if younger people start playing them.

It also sounds like Microsoft will be increasing the list over time. At the moment, we have about 60 games available on the service, but that number should rise to over 100 retro titles at some point.

The only caveat is that they can’t be played locally on your system, but are instead streamed over the internet.",https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/xbox-gamers-massive-new-free-game-drop-122370-20250522,Technology

Pi Network Sees Major Backing From Kraken: Pi Coin Price Rally Imminent?,"Kraken has rolled out perpetual futures contracts for Pi Network’s native token, Pi, marking the token’s first entry into a major derivatives market.

Traders can now go long or short Pi Coin with up to 20× leverage on Kraken Pro, using any of 40+ collateral options across 360+ markets.

Pi Network Futures Debut on Kraken

On May 23, Kraken announced via its Pro channel on X that Pi perpetual futures are live with up to 20× leverage. This listing makes Pi Network the only major altcoin without a Binance or Coinbase spot listing to appear on a tier-one derivatives platform.

Traders can now open perpetual positions—contracts without expiry—that track Pi Coin price, settling P&L continuously as prices move.

Kraken’s offering supports over 40 collateral types. It operates across more than 360 markets, giving users the flexibility to hedge or speculate on Pi without holding the token directly.

Per the Kraken Pro announcement, the move aims to attract both bulls and bears who want margin exposure to Pi’s price swings.

The new futures will add liquidity to the Pi Network’s native coin. In other words, perpetual contracts allow traders to express both bullish and bearish views. Long positions benefit from rises above the entry price; shorts gain when the Pi Coin price falls.

Leverage can amplify both gains and losses. A 1% move in Pi’s price at 20× leverage creates a 20% change in margin account equity. That heightens the risk of forced liquidations and sudden price swings.

More trading activity could stabilize Pi Coin’s price over time. Yet in the short term, added leverage often magnifies volatility, especially in a token where 60% of the supply remains under core team control.

Pi Network Risks and Structural Concerns

Despite Kraken’s support, Pi Network faces underlying skepticism. Node concentration in Vietnam and upcoming crypto rules there have raised doubts about network decentralization and stability.

The community has raised ongoing concerns about transparency. As noted by Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin), the Pi Core Team has routinely dismissed these demands and may only enact superficial changes to appear responsive.

“I fully expect the PCT to make some calculated move in the coming days or weeks—just enough to create the illusion that they are heading in the right direction,” he wrote on X, expressing his concerns.

Source: X

Heavy token unlock schedules also threaten to increase sell pressure, as large holders gain access to more coins on a fixed timeline.

Regulatory clarity remains incomplete. Pi Network is not yet listed on top-tier spot exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, signaling caution among major trading venues. Without broad spot listings, Pi’s liquidity depends heavily on derivatives and smaller exchanges.

Kraken’s listing puts Pi Coin in the spotlight. Traders now have tools to hedge or amplify views on Pi without owning the token. That access may draw fresh capital, especially from margin players.

Pi Coin Price Outlook

Following the announcement, Pi Coin price traded at $0.77, down 1% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data. Earlier this month, Pi spiked to $1.57 before dropping 10% in the week leading up to the futures launch.

Pi/USDT Chart| Source: Trading View

On May 12, Pi Coin price peaked at $1.67, then plunged to $0.66, erasing much of the bullish advance triggered by Binance listing rumors.

In late February, Pi Network’s daily volume topped $3.5 billion as the token launched on Gate.io. By mid-May, volumes fell below $40 million, a drop exceeding 98% in three months, according to CoinMarketCap data.",https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/24/pi-network-sees-major-backing-from-kraken-pi-coin-price-rally-imminent/,Business
PSX turns bearish as investors fear ‘unfriendly’ IMF-driven budget,"KARACHI: After an unprecedented relief rally in post-ceasefire week, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) came under renewed selling pressure, forcing the index to close the outgoing in the red as jittery investors trimmed their positions amid fears of an unfriendly IMF-driven federal budget.

Contrary to the preceding week, when the benchmark KSE 100 index recovered a staggering 12,474 points or 11.64pc thanks to a US-brokered ceasefire between two nuclear-armed neighbors, the PSX faltered due to lacklustre conditions as investors preferred to remain on the sidelines before the announcement of the budget 2025-26.

The government has delayed unveiling the federal budget from June 2 to June 10 due to inconclusive discussions with the International Monetary Fund on taxation and fiscal measures.

According to the brokerage AKD Securities Ltd, the market remained range-bound during the outgoing week as uncertainty over the upcoming budget moderated investor confidence built on the Pak-India ceasefire and the IMF agreement.

The benchmark KSE-100 index lost 546 points or 0.5pc to close at 119,102.67 points week-on-week. Market participation also weakened, with the average daily traded volume falling by 25pc to 492m shares while the traded value plunged by 38pc to Rs23.8bn.

Developments related to the upcoming budget suggest the government is likely to push up the revenue target for FY26 to Rs14.3 trillion from the current year’s Rs12.3tr. A key highlight of the budget includes tariff rationalisation; capping the highest tariff at 15pc, removing Additional Customs Duty (ACD), and reducing Regulatory Duty by 80pc till FY30.

The National Accounts Committee announced the country’s economy is expected to grow by 2.68pc in the current fiscal year, a revision from earlier projections of 3.6pc, suggesting that Pakistan will fall short of its GDP target.

The size of the economy went up to $410.96bn in FY25 from $371.66bn in FY24, mainly driven by growth in the services sector, followed by industry and livestock, making it the 40th largest in the world and pushing per capita income to a record $1,824 from $1,680 in FY24.

The IMF’s first review report acknowledged that Pakistan had met all quantitative performance criteria, most indicative targets, and several structural benchmarks. However, the fund also revised the GDP growth and current account deficit forecasts, updated the timelines of structural be­­­nchmarks, and introduced new ones for the next fiscal year. The fund, however, en­­dorsed the government’s plan to eliminate the power sector’s circular debt by FY31.

Despite a hefty rise in the State Bank of Pakistan’s reserves following the receipt of the second tranche of $1bn from the IMF, reaching a 17-week high of $11.4bn, the rupee depreciated by 0.11pc to Rs281.97 against the dollar week-on-week.

Other major developments include the IMF’s projection that external debt would rise to $126.7bn by FY26, profit repatriation increased by 115pc year-on-year in April, the economy grew by 2.4pc in Q3FY25, and power generation surged by 22pc in April.

Sector-wise, woollen, transport, and investment banks/companies and securities companies were amongst the top performers, up 11.3pc, 9.9pc and 7.1pc week-on-week.

On the other hand, Sugar & Allied Industries, Cement, and Cable & Electrical Goods reported a decline of 3pc, 2.8pc and 2.8pc, respectively.

Flow-wise, major net selling was recorded by mutual funds, other organisations, and companies with a net sell of $10.1m, $4.1m, and $2.9m, respectively.

On the other hand, individuals and insurance absorbed most of the selling with a net buy of $13.1m and $7.5m, respectively.

AKD Securities anticipates a positive momentum in the coming weeks, with developments around the upcoming federal budget likely to guide short-term sentiment. The KSE100 is expected to sustain its upward trajectory, with a target of 165,215 points by December, primarily driven by strong earnings in fertilisers, sustained ROEs in banks, and improving cash flows of E&Ps and OMCs, benefiting from falling interest rates and economic stability.

According to Arif Habib Ltd, investors are expected to remain cautious in the coming week as they await further clarity from the upcoming federal budget. The market is anticipated to remain in a consolidation phase, with support estimated at around 115,000 and resistance projected at 121,000.

Five skiers found dead in mountains near Swiss luxury resort,"The bodies of five skiers have been found in the mountains near Switzerland’s luxury resort of Zermatt, police said.

A helicopter was sent to survey the area around the Rimpfischhorn after climbers alerted authorities to abandoned skis near the summit on Saturday.

“The bodies of five people were quickly found,” Swiss police said, adding that authorities had opened an investigation and were working on identifying the victims.

The Rimpfischhorn is a 4,199-metre (13,776-foot) mountain that lies east of Zermatt, near the Italian border, and is popular with backcountry skiers.

The aviation firm Air Zermatt said it flew a rescue mission to the site on Saturday afternoon where it found the bodies of the victims.

The company said a group of mountaineers had spotted the four pairs of abandoned skis at an altitude of about 4,000 metres as they made their way up the Rimpfischhorn from the Britannia hut.

After the group raised the alarm, Air Zermatt said its rescuers found three bodies on an avalanche cone, a mass of snow and other debris deposited by a snow slip.

Two other people were discovered about 200 metres above on a small area of snow, the firm said.

A cause of death has not yet been made public.

Valais cantonal police said the victims were located on the Adler glacier after aerial and ground searches.

Air Zermatt said it had undertaken another challenging rescue mission nearby shortly before the five bodies were discovered.

It said heavy wind and fog had led to two mountaineers becoming stranded on the 4,000-metre Fiescherhörner. The “extremely difficult” conditions led to a first rescue mission being aborted, the company said, with a successful attempt made six hours later.

The discovery came four weeks after heavy snowfall triggered avalanches and road closures in the popular skiing destination.

Zermatt, which is famed for its views of “the world’s most photogenic mountain,” the Matterhorn, was temporarily inaccessible due to the deluge of snow last month, local media reported.

The Guardian has contacted local authorities for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/25/five-skiers-found-dead-rimpfischhorn-zermatt-switzerland,Business
Transformation And Time In Business AI Frenzy,"Five minutes to twelve: getty

For companies that want to modernize in the AI era – and to be frank, that’s almost every company – there are a lot of questions.

People want to know what these kinds of projects will look like, how to center on something that will converge well, and how to target those broader ideas to a specific enterprise and use case.

It’s not a one-size-fits-all solution – what works for one business might not work for another.

As I’ve been hearing a lot from accomplished executives and innovators who have been dealing with these questions, I’ve seen some basic principles crop up time again. Some of these can put a company on a path towards success in integrating AI.

Three Knowledge Points

Let me start out with three knowledge principles that address migration to AI systems.

The first one is knowing your customer – understanding who is using your company’s products and services, and how to use AI to serve them better.

There are all kinds of ways to do this, and we’ll get to some of them a little later – the basic idea is to build a knowledge base of customers and how they operate. That includes their pain points, shopping preferences, core missions, and their attitudes about technology as well.

The second is knowing your interface. Most business now takes place in a digital ecosystem in some way, shape or form. So the design of your user interface is important. UX/UI knowledge is a key part of this process. Companies have to experiment and put things together, and see what works.

The third knowledge principal here is to know the tools. The better you know how LLMs can be applied to business, the better you can brainstorm how to apply them to your business.

Timelines for Change in Business

Now I want to go over a few ideas that came from a recent panel at an Imagination in Action event in April. We had a number of experienced panelists talking about how all of this works for companies.

Zero to One

This first point is a little more about collaboration than time, per se.

Dan Slagen of Tomorrow.io talked about how the company‘s marketing team pioneered an AI project and then brought the results to the rest of the business.

“Once the company realized what marketing was doing, and the success we were having, they then asked the marketing department, ‘hey, can you guys go to all the other departments and try and take them from zero to one?’” Slagen said. “’Go work with the finance team, and the product team, and the people in the HR team, and just help them start to think about the systems they could put into place.”

So if your company takes this approach, in terms of timelines, you’ll be uploading the AI processes to one department first in a kind of pilot test, and then adopting a one-to-many mindset to evolve the rest of the business.

Catching Up

Panelist Karen Stroup of Wex said that the technology tends to move so fast that companies get left behind.

“I think right now we're at an interesting inflection point where the technology is far outpacing the cultural change and the adoption of the workforce,” she said. “So the technology is evolving every six months. It in general, takes six years for cultures to evolve. And so the technology is outpacing all of us and our human behavior. … our approach is to experiment. …. What do you want to learn? How quickly do you learn it?”

She talked about the use of two-week sprints to address this challenge, and get people up to speed to keep up with the pace of technology.

Three Clocks

I found this visualization by panelist Vladimir Jacimovic of Algoverde.ai to be absolutely compelling.

He described it as the “3 clocks” issue:

The first clock is the pace of the technologies, which is basically immediate – measured in the seconds that it takes for LLMs to return results, or for the AI to accomplish some task.

Then there’s the human timeline that’s measured in hours and days. We have a 40-hour work week, and we parcel out our productivity to fit that.

The third clock is the corporation’s clock, which is measured in quarters and years. That’s where people are assessing things from a birds-eye view and looking at everything at a broader level, and it’s a much slower and longer timeline.

Additional Insights

Coming back to the idea of knowing your customer, Jacimovic, and panelist Ron Farmer of Nissan, suggested that you can build AI focus groups with synthetic customers (AI personas) and this will tell you a lot about how to move forward with your business.

There was a lot more in this panel, and you can watch the video to get some of the other insights about business transformation.

But to me, applying these timelines and thinking about knowledge and interface design are key markers in the path toward successful AI adoption.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/05/25/transformation-and-time-in-business-ai-frenzy/,Business
Nvidia will reportedly release a lower-cost Blackwell AI chip for China in June,"Matthias is the co-founder and publisher of THE DECODER, exploring how AI is fundamentally changing the relationship between humans and computers.

AI and the UAE,"WHEN US President Donald Trump descended on the Middle East last week, he brought with him the CEOs of a host of American tech companies. These included Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Palantir’s Alex Karp and many others. These CEOs got the chance to get close to those who rule Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar and negotiate deals. This led to what Trump loves best: the announcement of multibillion-dollar tech deals for US companies.

Money was at the heart of all this — America is, after all, a capitalist machine, and must be fed cold hard cash. At the same time, this was also a strategic victory for the US in its competition with China in the realm of AI. One deal that was finalised between Abu Dhabi and American AI giant OpenAI illustrates this. The deal was made to establish one of the world’s largest AI hubs in Abu Dhabi, with an investment of up to $500bn in infrastructure and projects. The planned facility will reportedly span over 25 square kilometres and require power equal to five nuclear reactors.

The story of how Abu Dhabi got here is interesting against the backdrop of international relations, strategy and the US-China stand-off over AI. The UAE project has been developed in conjunction with an Abu Dhabi-based tech conglomerate G42 and is a part of OpenAI’s Stargate project, which hopes to set up similar hubs all around the world. However, until recently, the US had not trusted G42 with OpenAI’s pioneering AI technology.

In 2023, G42 was headed by an executive of Chinese-origin, a fact that was brought up by the CIA when a UAE official visited the White House in 2023. It was also underscored that G42 had relationships with Chinese intelligence outfits.

Pakistanis should worry about AI’s move to the Gulf.

All this changed when G42’s new CEO announced that the company had almost entirely divested from China. With China out of the picture and the Gulf leaders interested in deploying AI for their own purposes, the market was well and truly opened for OpenAI. Therefore, last week when Trump traipsed into Abu Dhabi, he and OpenAI were also at the helm of a strategic victory. Whatever divestment the UAE had enabled from China, it appears to have been enough to mollify US concerns about the leak of AI technology into China. The stage was set for the unveiling of a massive data hub.

So the UAE (the Saudis and Qataris have arranged their own deals) is going to be the largest AI data hub in the region. It is also indicative of the hopes that Emirati rulers harbour about the use of AI within their professional and social environments.

It is well known that the UAE has an enormous guest-worker population that fills both low-skill construction and similar job slots and high-skill white-collar positions such as those in engineering and technology. The shift to AI could well make the UAE far less dependent on these migrant populations.

According to AI experts, jobs such as those of cashiers, data entry clerks, truckers and delivery people on the low-skilled end will vanish in the AI-led future. Similarly, software engineers and developers and other such tech workers will likely also be replaced by computers that can write code faster and with greater accuracy. Doctors, particularly those in specialised areas of medicine, such as radiology and pathology, could see their jobs disappear as computers analyse far more data about a patient’s condition and produce more accurate diagnosis than they ever can.

This move towards AI in the Gulf is something that Pakistanis need to be concerned about. Pakistan re­­lies on exporting blue-collar and whi­te-collar workers to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia and remittances from these workers are a crucial part of the country’s economy. They determine how people think of their children’s future and their education and the courses of study that young people choose to pursue. While Pakistan may not have deep AI penetration or even development in our local market at present, this is not the case for the global arena where we go to work.

Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries have, for a long time now, seen migrant labour as a problem to be solved, and they may have hit upon a solution that serves them well. All the subcontinental faces that one sees on visits to Riyadh and Dubai may see their days in these Arab places numbered once the new AI future of the Middle East, as envisioned by its rulers, is realised. In their view, if migrant workers can be replaced with AI, their countries can be reclaimed for their true natural-born citizens. The question is, what will countries like Pakistan do for their own citizens in a future where their export to labour markets in the Gulf will become a vastly limited option?

"Oil gains on short-covering, nuclear talks","Oil prices gained as US buyers covered positions ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend amid worries over the latest round of nuclear talks between American and Iranian negotiators.

Brent crude futures settled at $64.78 a barrel, up 34 cents, or 0.54%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures finished at $61.53, up 33 cents, or 0.54%.

“I think there is some short-covering going into this weekend,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.

The Memorial Day weekend kicks off the US summer driving season, the period of highest demand for motor fuels.

U.S. and Iranian negotiators met in Rome on Friday in another round of talks aimed at curtailing the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program. Traders are afraid crude supplies could be interrupted if talks fail to reach a deal, Flynn said.

“The talks are not looking good,” he said. “If these are the last talks and there’s no deal, it could give a green light to the Israelis to attack Iran.”

President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is recommending a straight 50% tariff on goods from the EU starting on June 1, saying the bloc has been hard to deal with on trade.

“The oil market has been under pressure from two things,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. “We await the impact of tariffs on oil demand and OPEC+ is expected to increase supply again this summer.”

OPEC+, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia is holding meetings next week expected to yield another output increase of 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) for July.

Reuters reported this month that the group could unwind the rest of its 2.2 million bpd voluntary production cut by the end of October, having already raised output targets by about 1 million bpd for April, May and June.",https://arynews.tv/oil-gains-on-short-covering-nuclear-talks/,Business
Researchers identify best drugs for severe Covid,"Healthcare workers are pictured at a testing centre for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), in Buenos Aires, Argentina, January 6, 2022. — Reuters

Researchers reported in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine that a class of drugs known as Janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitors, which work by slowing down the immune system, should be the first-line therapy for patients hospitalised for Covid-19.

Individual outcomes of nearly 13,000 adults hospitalised for Covid who participated in 16 randomised trials comparing JAK inhibitors to other drugs or placebos between May 2020 and March 2022 were analysed by the researchers.

Overall, 11.7% of patients who received JAK inhibitors died by day 28, compared with 13.2% of those who received other treatments such as the steroid dexamethasone or medications that block the signalling of the inflammatory protein IL-6.

After accounting for individual risk factors, the odds of death by day 28 were 33% lower in the JAK inhibitor group.

“These results should inform World Health Organisation Covid-19 treatment guidelines, both in the USA and Europe,” an editorial published with the study said. “Although the pandemic has passed and Covid-19 is not nearly as rampant as it was previously, delays in disseminating and adopting best-evidence treatment practices can only be harmful.”

JAK inhibitors include Pfizer’s Xeljanz (tofacitinib), Eli Lilly’s Olumiant (baricitinib), and AbbVie’s Rinvoq (upadacitinib).

JAK inhibitors also decreased the need for new mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support, and allowed for faster discharge from hospital by about 1 day, with fewer serious adverse events.

The findings were true regardless of patients’ Covid vaccination status.

“The certainty of the authors’ conclusion that JAK inhibitory therapy for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital for Covid-19 provides a significant mortality benefit is further supported when the analysis is limited to placebo-controlled studies,” the editorial says.

For very large fetuses, early induction may be beneficial

When a near-term fetus is expected to be larger than most other newborns at birth, it might be safer to induce labour a bit ahead of the due date, new data suggest.

Births of large babies can be complicated by shoulder dystocia, an emergency situation in which their shoulders become impacted on the mother's pubic bones after their head has emerged, preventing the rest of the body from being delivered spontaneously.

To see if inducing labour ahead of schedule would reduce the risk of shoulder dystocia, researchers recruited 2,893 women whose fetuses appeared on ultrasound to be larger than 90% of other similarly-aged fetuses.

They randomly assigned the women to receive standard care or induction between 38 weeks and 38-weeks-and-four-days of gestation. Induction was expected to result in an earlier birth and a lower birth weight than standard care.

Overall, in the so-called Big Baby Trial, there was no difference between the groups in rates of shoulder dystocia, probably because many of the women in the standard care group delivered before 38 weeks, and so their babies were smaller than predicted.

When the analysis was limited to women who did not deliver before 38 weeks, shoulder dystocia occurred in 2.3% of babies in the induction group versus 3.7% of those in the standard care group.

The induction group delivered on average about 8 days earlier, and their babies weighed about 8 ounces (213 grams) less, compared to the usual-care group.

After accounting for individual risk factors, the odds of shoulder dystocia were 38% lower in the induction group versus usual care in women whose pregnancies lasted beyond 38 weeks.

Induction of labour was also associated with a lower likelihood of cesarean delivery and fewer maternal complications, researchers reported in The Lancet.

An editorial published with the report notes, “The Big Baby Trial joins an accumulating body of literature... indicating that induction of labour either does not alter or might reduce the risk for needing cesarean delivery” when a larger fetus is suspected.

New bed net treatment targets malaria parasites in mosquitoes

Bed nets may once again become useful against malaria in endemic regions, with use of a chemical that targets the malaria-causing parasite in mosquitoes rather than the mosquitoes themselves, researchers reported on Wednesday in Nature.

The use of long-lasting insecticides in bed nets significantly reduced malaria cases and deaths between 2000 and 2015, but the method eventually became less effective due to the rise of insecticide resistance.

The researchers from the Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health in Boston screened 81 endochin-like quinolones (ELQs), a class of experimental antimalarial agents, and identified two that block the development of the malaria parasite by targeting a key protein in the parasite.

The ELQs were effective even against mosquitoes that were resistant to traditional insecticides.

“Malaria control desperately needs innovation,” study co-author Dr Flaminia Catteruccia said in a statement.

“Our chemistry collaborators at Oregon Health and Science University were able to generate these compounds inexpensively, which would allow this approach to be integrated into existing bed net infrastructure at a competitive cost,” study leader Alexandra Probst said in a statement.",https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1314795-researchers-identify-best-drugs-for-severe-covid,Business
"UAE Dirham to Pakistani Rupee Rate Today- May 24, 2025","Karachi, 24 May 2025 – The open market exchange rate for the UAE Dirham (AED) stands at 76.44 PKR against the Pakistani Rupee (PKR), according to the most recent currency market data.

This stability is a result of a calm period for the AED-PKR exchange, supported by consistent money transfers and robust economic conditions in both Pakistan and the UAE.

Procedure for Analyzing the AED-PKR Exchange Rate

The exchange value of the UAE Dirham in relation to the Pakistani Rupee is influenced by market dynamics and interventions from the central bank. The Dirham is pegged to the US Dollar at approximately 3.67 AED/USD, a system that the UAE Central Bank established in 1997. This fixed exchange rate maintains the Dirham’s alignment with the US Dollar, backed by the UAE’s oil-based economy and initiatives to diversify into other sectors.

1 UAE DIRHAM = 76.44 PAKISTANI RUPEES

Conversely, the PKR’s value is managed through a floating exchange rate system. Our analysis indicates that the demand and supply for foreign exchange primarily govern this mechanism. The State Bank of Pakistan occasionally intervenes to reduce volatility. Factors like remittances, foreign reserves, trade balances, and inflation, especially the $3.1 billion received from the UAE in February 2025, also impact the PKR’s value.

The daily conversion rate from AED to PKR is derived from both the interbank and open market exchange rates. Banks and currency exchange firms quote a buying rate of 76.67 PKR and a selling rate of approximately 77.25 PKR, with a slight additional charge for sellers. This information is refreshed every day at 8:00 AM Pakistan Standard Time and may vary throughout the day according to market fluctuations.

Influence of Stability

The fixed exchange rate of 76.44 PKR for the UAE Dirham has significant ramifications for Pakistan and for the over two million Pakistanis working in the UAE. This fixed rate gives them assurance when sending money back home, which is beneficial for family-owned businesses in Pakistan. It also aids trading firms engaged in the import and export of commodities like food, textiles, and construction materials between the UAE and Pakistan, as it mitigates currency risks.

For the economy of Pakistan, a stable AED-PKR exchange rate facilitates smooth remittances, which are vital for maintaining foreign exchange reserves. Experts indicate that this stability arises from sound trading practices, solid reserves, and low speculative pressure. The UAE serves as a crucial economic partner for Pakistan, where remittances play a key role in stabilizing the PKR. Nonetheless, the PKR’s managed floating system makes it vulnerable to internal factors such as inflation and trade deficits. Currency analysts warn that while the AED-PKR exchange rate is currently stable, market participants should remain vigilant about potential volatility stemming from global oil prices and geopolitical tensions that could affect the value of the US Dollar and, by extension, the Dirham.

Overview of AED and PKR

The UAE Dirham was introduced in 1973 to replace the Qatar and Dubai Riyal as the official currency of the UAE, issued and managed by the UAE Central Bank and subdivided into 100 fils. Abbreviated as AED, its peg to the US Dollar is maintained by the UAE’s oil wealth, prudent fiscal policies, and its role as a global trade hub. The Dirham is widely utilized across all seven emirates, especially in major urban centers like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, as well as in popular tourist areas.

The Pakistani Rupee has been in circulation since 1947 and serves as the currency for Pakistan, divided into 100 paise and symbolized by “₨” or “Rs.” It is issued by the State Bank of Pakistan and operates under a controlled floating regime. This means it changes based on various elements like inflation, trade deficits, and the availability of reserves. Remittances sent back from the UAE are crucial for maintaining the stability of the PKR. An exchange rate of 76.67 PKR per 1 AED indicates that the country’s economy is stable.",https://arynews.tv/uae-dirham-to-pakistani-rupee-rate-today-may-24-2025/,Business

India faces huge drop in foreign investment amid global concerns and U.S. pressure,"India has recorded a sharp 96.5% fall in foreign direct investment (FDI) during the current financial year. According to the Times of India, the country received only $350 million in FDI, compared to $10 billion last year. This is the lowest figure reported in years. The report highlights that this drop is alarming for India’s economic outlook.

Several reasons caused this major decline. First, foreign investors pulled out from high-profile Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Second, many Indian companies moved their money abroad instead of reinvesting at home. As a result, investor confidence dropped. These moves reflect a lack of trust in India’s current investment environment.

Moreover, foreign investors withdrew around $49 billion from India during this fiscal year. They had already pulled out $41 billion the previous year. This trend shows that foreign investors are becoming more cautious. Uncertainty in global markets also adds to this hesitation. These numbers indicate deeper concerns about India’s financial stability.

Adding to the pressure, the United States announced a new tax on iPhones made in India. President Donald Trump said only U.S.-made iPhones will be sold in American markets. He warned Apple that imported phones will face heavy taxes. This decision could hurt India’s growing smartphone manufacturing industry, especially Apple’s plans.

Overall, India’s economic challenges continue to grow. The FDI drop and U.S. tax decision raise serious questions. Will India regain investor trust? The government now faces tough decisions. If not handled well, these issues may slow down economic growth further. For now, India’s business future remains uncertain.",https://dailytimes.com.pk/1306058/india-faces-huge-drop-in-foreign-investment-amid-global-concerns-and-u-s-pressure/,Business

Who is calling the shots when it comes to UK wage levels: workers or bosses?,"When Eastbourne’s refuse collectors secured a huge 11% pay rise, increasing to 19% for the lowest paid, it seemed like worker power was back.

It was early 2022 and inflation was rocketing on its way to a peak of 11%. In a desperate scramble to keep pace with rising prices to protect their incomes, workers across the UK’s public and private sectors took widescale industrial action in a way that brought back memories of the 1970s. What followed was a series of pay deals thrashed out between bosses and employees, with unions often arguing they had been due pay increases for years.

Now, a similar scenario is playing out, though this time by stealth. The Bank of England has noted that wages have quietly continued to rise over the last year, and worries it could indicate a seismic and more long-lasting shift in the relationship between workers and employers. This week’s public sector pay awards were higher than ministers had previously said they could afford and outstripped higher than expected inflation – although the rise was labelled “derisory” by disgruntled doctors.

Relations between bosses and the rank and file in office jobs have already been frayed by a shift towards remote working caused by the pandemic, and then companies’ increasing insistence on more regular attendance at work.

Threadneedle Street policymakers have asked whether the wage increases indicate that the power balance has moved back in the direction of workers, allowing them to protect their finances regardless of the economic ups and downs, including the shocks of multiple wars and Donald Trump’s trade offensive.

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has gone some way to justifying this view. Using payroll data, the ONS said hotels and restaurants paid staff 8.5% over the year to April when inflation was 3.5%. Retail workers managed to secure an increase in median pay of 6.9% over the same period. The average across the economy in the year to April was 6.4%.

Last week, the central bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, said the UK’s labour market was becoming less flexible, suggesting employers were no longer able to freely hire and fire as they once could.

Businesses, charities and public sector organisations have been laying off staff and freezing job adverts, but those staff who stay behind are being well-rewarded.

“I am quite sympathetic to Pill’s view,” says Ben Caswell, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).

Wages adjusted for inflation have returned to where they were before the cost of living crisis began in 2021. And the share of overall national income that is secured by workers rather than firms has also recovered to 2021 levels.

While the average pay figures disguise many winners and losers, Caswell says the aggregate figure showed most workers had benefited from inflation busting pay rises to recover lost ground.

He focuses on a slightly less up-to-date measure of pay-based employees’ average regular earnings over a rolling three-month period. This showed a rise in Great Britain that was still well above inflation at 5.6% in January to March 2025, though not as much as PAYE data shows.

Caswell says a series of minimum wage increases, closing the gap with the average wage, is also likely to fuel further pay rises as companies attempt to maintain a significant difference between the salaries of those on the bottom rung and the semi-skilled workers and middle managers above them.

Wage compression is a term that captures the pay squeeze. This year, the national living wage equates to about 57% of the average wage, up from 50% 10 years ago.

“There has been a compression of differentials that cannot be sustained. At some point soon the pressure on employers to reward workers higher up the pay scales will play out,” he says.

James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, says the weakening economic outlook worked against a prolonged recovery in pay.

He said pay figures may be following the same trajectory as the Looney Tunes cartoon character Wile E Coyote, who would frequently pursue his prey off a cliff and continue to run without any visible means of support, before plunging to the rocks below.

Smith says: “If we believe that wages consistent with the Bank of England’s 2% target would be about 3.5%, then we are well above that level at the moment. And that would give the Bank good reason to be cautious about cutting interest rates.

“However, other pay surveys are showing earnings rising at a much slower rate, so the official figures might be a bit like Wile E Coyote and about to be brought down to earth.”

Emphasising the likely short-term nature of the current bumper pay rises, the Bank’s own regional agents, a network who monitor business conditions, say employers are limiting pay rises to between 3% an 4% by the end of the year.

The government is not planning to pay more than 4% to public sector workers on average, and next month’s spending review is likely to see departmental budgets squeezed.

There are also explanations for the possibly exaggerated pay increases in each industry over the last year.

Restaurants, cafes and hotels are known to employ a high proportion of minimum wage workers and the same applies to the retail industry, boosting pay this year, but most likely not next year or the year after when the legal minumum rises more slowly.

Construction workers enjoyed a 6.7% rise in earnings over the last year after a dire two-year period of recession in the buildings trade. Now that firms are gearing up to construct more homes as part of Labour’s pledge to build 1.5 million by the end of the parliament, it is easy to see why wages might be rising.

More broadly, the significant return to offices demanded by employers would appear to show that worker power has its limits.

If there is a paradigm shift in the labour market, Seemanti Ghosh, principal economist at the Institute for Employment Studies, says it was connected to a gold rush for digital skills.

She says employers needed to hold on to skilled staff and pay them more while they embarked on a search for workers who were more adaptable in an ever-changing work environment.

It amounts to an extra layer of cost to employers after increases to the minimum wage and national insurance contributions last month, as well as higher bills during what was dubbed “awful April”.

Ghosh said job adverts were hanging around unfilled for longer this year than in 2024, handing in-demand workers a pay premium when they secure a new role.

“If wage increases are not driven by negotiations with unions, then they are due to employers wanting to hang on to skilled staff,” she says.

“This matters for all companies that increasingly rely on soft skills for things like project management and tech skills in other areas. We also see it in the green sector, where there is a shortage of people with the skills the industry needs,” she says.

How much of this dislocation is systemic and will keep wages higher for longer is going to be a subject of debate for the rest of the year.

Pill said he wanted to keep interest rates elevated while the trends become clearer, believing there is less damage from higher rates than letting inflation runaway again.

Other members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) disagree, arguing that businesses cannot invest in skills training while borrowing costs are prohibitively high. It’s a very different view of the labour market – one that focuses more on the scarring effect of more job losses and economic stagnation.

Pill’s colleagues on the MPC, Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor, want rates to come down quickly, and a distinct split emerged when rates were cut this month.

Who wins the argument inside the central bank could well dictate whether workers or bosses have the whip hand in the great tussle over pay.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/25/who-is-calling-the-shots-when-it-comes-to-uk-wage-levels-workers-or-bosses,Business
Whatever happened to Elon Musk? Tech boss drifts to margins of Trump world,"The Oval Office was crowded, with reporters cautioned not to collide with the Resolute Desk. Standing beside them, dressed in black, was Elon Musk, billionaire ally of Donald Trump and head of his government efficiency drive.

“Elon is from South Africa – I don’t want to get Elon involved,” the US president told his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa, during a discussion about crime against white farmers. “He actually came here on a different subject: sending rockets to Mars. He likes that better.”

Musk’s silence during the fraught hour-long meeting was a small but telling reminder of his shift in Trump’s orbit. He remains close to the president and welcome in the West Wing. He also paid a second visit to the Pentagon this week. But a relationship that many forecast would end in an explosive collision of egos seems instead to be undergoing an inexorable tapering off.

On Monday, the Politico website published an analysis under the headline “Why has Elon Musk disappeared from the spotlight?” It found a sharp drop in the number of times that Trump posted about Musk on his Truth Social platform, from an average of four times a week in February and March to zero since the start of April.

In February, Politico said, Trump’s fundraising operation invoked Musk in fundraising emails almost every day, with one message reading: “I love Elon Musk! The media wants to drive us apart, and it’s not working. He’s great.” But such mentions abruptly halted in early March, with the exception of one email in May advertising a “Gulf of America” hat that Musk had worn.

In addition, White House officials no longer fill their social media feeds with Musk-related content. Reporters seldom ask about him at the White House press briefing. Members of Congress are giving his name a wide berth.

Musk seems to be taking the hint. This week, the Tesla chief executive confirmed that he had reduced his role as the unofficial head of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to just two days a week, and will also cut his political spending substantially – the latest public signal that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.

It is a dramatic shift from the first weeks of Trump’s second term, when Musk attended the inauguration, was a constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, appeared alongside Trump in the Oval Office and gave a joint interview on Fox News full of mutual admiration. Doge dominated media headlines as it took a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy.

It seemed that Trump was dazzled by the world’s richest person, who sends rockets into space and spent at least $250m to support his election campaign last year. In March, the president even turned the White House south lawn into a temporary Tesla showroom, displaying five of the electric vehicles and promising to buy one himself.

But the polls told their own story. Last month, a national survey by Marquette University Law School found approval of how Musk is handling his work at Doge at 41% with disapproval at 58%. About 60% of those polled had an unfavourable view of Musk himself, compared with 38% who were favourably disposed to him.

Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of Congress who has known Musk for more than a decade, commented: “As his numbers declined, so did Trump’s interest. Trump discards people when their ratings fall and it’s very transactional. It’s nothing more than an initial fascination and a sense of being discarded.”

Khanna, whose congressional district sits in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, had predicted from the outset that Musk was not going to last more than four or five months: “I said he’s going to get frustrated, exhausted and Washington will win – not him – in terms of how the town works.”

At that time, Khanna was hoping that Doge would make cuts at the Pentagon. Instead, it flouted the constitution to slash the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service and other targets.

“I said there’s no way he’s going to get anywhere close to $2tn of cuts; he didn’t even get close to a trillion; it’s about $81bn. He learned the lesson that a lot of very successful business leaders learn, that democracy is much tougher than they imagine and doesn’t bend to their will,” Khanna said.

Indeed, Musk continues to hit roadblocks. On Wednesday, the US Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Doge was illegal. On Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco said Trump cannot restructure and downsize the US government without the consent of Congress and that she would probably extend her ruling blocking federal agencies from implementing mass layoffs.

Even so, Doge has already enacted deep cuts to the workforce and spending and, in some cases, sought to shutter entire agencies, causing untold damage to the fabric of government.

For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) “is not ready” for next month’s start of the hurricane season, according to an internal agency review reported by CNN. The disaster relief agency, which employs more than 20,000 workers, has lost roughly 30% of its full-time staff to layoffs and Doge buyouts.

Khanna warned: “We’re going to be living with the consequences for years to come because unfortunately they’ve managed to totally destroy USAID, they’ve destroyed NIH [the National Institutes of Health], they’ve destroyed FDA [the Food and Drug Administration], they’ve destroyed EPA [the Environmental Protection Agency], they’ve hollowed out so much of the state department and it’s going to take a generation to rebuild.

“I’m hoping that the damage will stop. We have to see what will continue but hopefully there’ll be no more sledgehammer to these institutions.”

Even conservatives who believe in downsizing government share the concerns. Rick Tyler, a political strategist who has worked on Republican campaigns, said: “What they’re trying to do is make the government smaller, which I applaud, but they are not making it more efficient because there has been no vision, no plan to actually make the government operate with fewer people and less money. There is no redesign. This is just slash and burn.”

Tesla, which is the major source of Musk’s wealth, has suffered significant brand damage and lost sales due to his political work, particularly with Trump. He has also expressed support for the far-right, anti-immigration AfD party in Germany. Tesla dealerships have become scenes of protest and vandalism in the US and beyond.

It may be that Musk met his political Waterloo in Wisconsin. His spending of at least $3m helped make Wisconsin’s supreme court race the most expensive of its kind in US history. He even made a personal appearance in Green Bay the weekend before the election wearing a cheesehead hat – popular with fans of the NFL’s Green Bay Packers – and personally handed out cheques for $1m to supporters.

But the candidate he backed lost by 10 percentage points. Democrats had used his intervention to successfully mobilise voters in an election dubbed “People vs Musk”.

This week, Musk told Bloomberg’s Qatar Economic Forum in Doha: “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future.” The Wisconsin Democratic party chair, Ben Wikler, told the Associated Press: “The people have won. The biggest funder in Republican politics is taking his toys and going home.”

Evidently, Musk and his chainsaw have become a political liability for Republicans seeking re-election in next year’s midterms. Democrats in races across the country are expected to use Musk as a political boogeyman in attack ads on their opponents.

Tyler observed: “The polling numbers, Trump suffering politically, which would hurt his party, which is going to hurt his agenda, caused enough strife that I’m sure he heard from enough members to say, could we just not talk about Elon Musk any more?”

Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, added: “It was a trial balloon on how they would reduce federal employees. If it worked and people thought it was great, maybe they would keep going with or without Musk, but they used him as the front person for it and the punching bag. When it backfired, they cut him loose. Not surprising at all.

“There is nobody that you can sincerely believe Donald Trump thinks is important to his popularity or his standing in a positive way because he believes he generates all that himself. And I don’t think he’s wrong about that. But if you become a liability, you’re gone pretty quickly.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/25/elon-musk-trump-politics,Business
"AI to transform telecoms but technology won’t completely replace humans, new Optus CEO says","Optus’s new chief executive, Stephen Rue, says artificial intelligence will play a significant role in the future of telecommunications, but humans will remain central to the company.

Rue joined the Australian mobile network operator, a subsidiary of Singaporean telecommunications company Singtel, in November last year after six years at the helm of the federal government’s National Broadband Network (NBN).

His appointment came after two tough years for the telco, with a massive data breach affecting millions of customers, and a 14-hour national mobile network outage that led to new rules around emergency calling. The previous chief executive, Kelly Bayer-Rosmarin, quit the company two weeks after the outage.

Customers have slowly returned to Optus, with the company adding 238,000 new mobile subscribers, including 52,000 on postpaid plans, in its financial year ending 31 March 2025, results released on Thursday showed.

As companies across the globe begin to examine how to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into their business, Rue said the technology would have a significant role in the future of telecommunications, particularly in helping customers.

“One of the things we need to do in terms of IT and data and, indeed, process redesign is to look at how we incorporate AI into that,” he said.

“It will help us with customer experience. It will help us with identifying faults, for example, by identifying customers’ issues so that they [can be] dealt with, enabling them to simply solve their own problems, enabling us to look at customer segmentation in a more granular way, so that we can actually deliver offers, deliver products to customers.”

He said while AI would find efficiencies in the company, humans would always have a role.

“On top of AI, there’s clearly decisions that would need to be taken by humans,” he said.

“AI can help bring a lot of data analytics quickly to humans so they can make better decisions.

“For example, you’ll always need technicians in the field. You always need people building, you’ll always need people making decisions around creative, people making decisions in call centres for customers, so AI can actually supplement that.”

Rue said his focus since starting at Optus had been examining the company’s governance, risk management and how to rebuild trust in the community.

“The other focus I’ve had is clearly in looking at our longer-term plans in terms of network, with not just a focus on resilience, which you’d expect, but also a focus on [the] company longer-term,” he said.

“It’s simplifying the organisation, managing our costs and ensuring that we can continue to have a range of products that are competitive in the marketplace.”

After spending endless hours over the past few years answering questions from senators in Senate estimates about the state of the NBN, Rue said he was not surprised the government-owned national broadband network had not been a key focus of the federal election this time around.

“There was a lot of debate over the last decade. I think with the National Broadband Network that has now clearly been not just built out, but there’s clear plans to upgrade technology to more fibre-based and to higher speeds, and the NBN has obviously also increased the capability of the fixed wireless network,” he said.

“In some ways, a lot of the policy debate has either been settled or has moved on in the last decade.”

Rue said there was more to do on mobile coverage across Australia, and he was looking forward to working with the government, including the new communications minister, Anika Wells, on the universal outdoor mobile coverage plan that would leverage commercial low-earth orbit satellite networks, such as Starlink, to supplement mobile networks in places where there was no coverage for text and calls.

“I think that clearly will be a discussion of policy and how that can be implemented,” he said.

“Personally, I’m very supportive of these discussions with government, and it will, I think, provide operators like Optus and an ability to provide cost-effective ways to provide those services.”

Optus reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $2.2bn, up 5.7% on its previous financial year.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/26/artificial-intelligence-humans-optus-ceo-stephen-rue,Business
"US Risks Losing ‘Reliable Investment’ Status, Allianz GI Manager Says","(Bloomberg) -- Inside one of Europe’s biggest asset managers, there’s growing concern that Republican efforts to gut legislation supporting key industries such as clean energy may result in the US losing its status as a destination for investor capital.

Most Read from Bloomberg

“For investors, the message is clear: The US may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago,” said Alex Bibani, a London-based senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, which oversees some $650 billion in assets.

The decision by House Republicans to pass a tax bill that would do away with many of the incentives contained in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act threatens to upend investment strategies premised on the clean energy-transition. Even if the Senate votes to block some of the House proposals, European asset managers still have to contend with a new level of uncertainty and volatility that may ultimately force them to turn elsewhere, Bibani said.

“Project economics, supply-chain commitments, and capital flows may now pivot toward more stable jurisdictions like Canada or the EU, unless clarity is quickly restored,” he said.

It’s the latest wedge dividing Europe, where emissions reductions are anchored in law, and the US, where the Trump administration has mounted a full-throated attack on net zero policies. The bill agreed by House Republicans is even “worse than feared” for investors committed to energy transition strategies, according to equity analysts at Jefferies.

If passed by the Senate, a repeal of the IRA “would mark a sharp reversal in US clean-tech policy,” Bibani said. That would inject “significant regulatory and political risk into the market, undermining the policy certainty and financial predictability that made the US the world’s leading destination for clean tech capital post-IRA.”

The S&P 500 Index fell last week, while the yield on 30-year US Treasuries rose as high as 5.1% as markets digested news of the Republican bill, amid estimates it will add trillions of dollars to the deficit. President Donald Trump then ended the week by injecting further uncertainty into markets as he escalated the tariff war with the European Union, even declaring he’s “not looking for a deal.” The dollar fell.

US hostility toward energy-transition policies has already sent a chill through European investing circles, where such strategies are a major driver of flows. Amundi SA, Europe’s largest asset manager, said last month it was seeing evidence that clients had “massively repositioned” to avoid the US market, amid concerns over everything from a lack of stewardship to a degradation of key climate policies. UBS Group AG also said it was aware of sizeable flows out of US equity exchange-traded funds.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-risks-losing-reliable-investment-140000325.html,Business
Large Clonal Hematopoiesis Clones Linked to Shorter Survival in MCL,"Myeloid clonal hematopoiesis status did not significantly affect PFS.

Large clonal hematopoiesis clones were associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with treatment-naive mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) receiving lenalidomide (Revlimid) maintenance or observation after chemoimmunotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant, according to an analysis of the phase 3 MCL0208 trial (NCT02354313) published in Blood Advances.1

At a median follow-up of 7 years, patients with large clonal hematopoiesis clones (variant allele frequency [VAF] ≥ 10%; n = 8) experienced higher risk of disease progression (HR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.36-6.31; P = .006) and death (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.21-7.55; P = .018) compared with those without myeloid clonal hematopoiesis (n = 220). Additionally, patients with large clones experienced a longer time to hematological recovery following ASCT vs those with small (VAF < 10%; n = 26) or no clones (P = .026).

“[Our data] showed for the first time that large clonal hematopoiesis clones might associate with unfavorable clinical impact in patients with MCL,” the study authors wrote.

MCL0208 Study Design

MCL0208 was an open-label, multicenter, Italian study that enrolled previously untreated patients with MCL. Patients were 18 to 65 years old and did not have clinically significant comorbidities.

All patients received 3 cycles of R-CHOP21 (rituximab cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) followed by 4 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide, 2 cycles of cytarabine at 2 g/m2 every 3 hours for 3 days, and ASCT conditioning via BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) or FEAM (fotemustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan). Following ASCT, patients who experienced overall hematological recovery and a complete or partial response were randomly assigned to receive maintenance lenalidomide at 15 mg on days 1 to 21 every 28 days or observation, both over 24 months.

The primary end point was PFS.2 Secondary end points included OS, disease-free survival, event-free survival, complete response (CR) rate, overall response rate, safety, and quality of life.

For the analysis, the study authors collected unsorted bone marrow and peripheral blood samples at baseline and within 12 months following ASCT.1 The samples were then evaluated for myeloid clonal hematopoiesis via next-generation sequencing.

At baseline, the median age in the overall analysis population was 57 years (range, 32-66), and 78% of patients were male. Most patients had classic histology (92%), a Ki67 index of less than 30 (71%), lactate dehydrogenase levels at or below the upper limit of normal (70%), Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) low-risk disease (62%), and an ECOG performance status of 0 (77%). Ninety-four percent of patients had stage IV disease.

Half of the patients were randomly assigned to the lenalidomide arm (52%) and underwent random assignment following ASCT (72%). Among patients who received ASCT (n = 222), 91% experienced a CR following ASCT.

Additional Efficacy Data

Additional findings from the study showed that the presence of any myeloid clonal hematopoiesis did not significantly affect PFS (P = .457) or OS (P = .514). However, patients with large clones still displayed shortened PFS (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.03-5.01; P = .042) and a trend towards worse OS (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.71-4.87; P = .203) compared with those without myeloid clonal hematopoiesis after the study authors applied propensity score adjustment for age, sex, MIPI score, Ki67, bulky disease, bone marrow involvement, and blastoid subtype.

“Taken together, our findings offer novel insights in MCL biology by dynamically characterizing the myeloid clonal hematopoiesis landscape in these patients,” the study authors concluded. “We propose that large myeloid clonal hematopoiesis clones may exert a not-negligible role in lymphoma progression, potentially affecting patient outcome. Further efforts are required to elucidate how myeloid clonal hematopoiesis might influence the tumor microenvironment and eventually affect the survival of MCL cells and their response to treatment.”

AI drives growth for a few Chinese companies. Analysts share their picks,"Spending on artificial intelligence helped give some Chinese tech companies a boost in the first quarter, despite economic headwinds. ""The standout for this [first quarter] reporting season was the growth in cloud business for Alibaba and Baidu ,"" said Brian Tycangco, an analyst at Stansberry Research. Alibaba said earlier this month its cloud revenue in the latest quarter rose by 18% year on year , while Baidu on Wednesday said its AI cloud business grew by 42% . ""At these rates of growth, cloud business is poised to become the 2nd largest business segment for both companies,"" Tycangco said. ""More importantly, cloud will become the basis for a return to heady growth days after several years of single-digit topline growth."" Alibaba, Tencent and JD.com also reported double-digit growth in marketing revenue, which they said were bolstered by AI tools that were able to target consumers more effectively. The trend signals a fundamental change in Chinese markets. ""AI/Tech/New Economy [are] further gaining traction as equity market leaders,"" Morgan Stanley's chief China equity strategist Laura Wang said in a May 20 note. ""We believe that a new generation of equity market leaders is forming in these sectors, after a 5-year-long disruption period post market peak in early 2021,"" she said, noting how consumer and internet stocks previously led gains. Out of Morgan Stanley's 60 Chinese AI stock picks, those rated overweight, traded in Hong Kong and with expected upside of more than 50% as of May 19 are: Gushengtang — This health-care company is focused on traditional Chinese medicine, and it's training targeted AI models to create an ""AI physician assistant."" The company said customer visits rose by 12.7% in the first quarter to 1.21 million. Bairong — This cloud-based AI services company is focused on state-owned banks and other financial services companies. The company added in its 2024 annual report that Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms use Bairong's AI model service to evaluate consumers' purchasing power. When it comes to more popular names, the Morgan Stanley analysts prefer Alibaba and Tencent over Baidu and iFlytek. They also prefer Meituan, Meitu and Trip.com over Kuaishou and JD.com. Among mainland China-listed companies, 68% mentioned AI in their 2024 annual reports, up from 43% in the first half of 2024, HSBC Qianhai Securities head of research Steven Sun, said in a May 16 report. “We also observed a slightly upward revision of 2025e consensus capex for major cloud service providers after 1Q25 results, suggesting they are still upbeat about their AI business.” The information technology sector saw earnings rise by 24.7% in the first quarter from a year ago on improving AI penetration, the HSBC report said, noting it was one of the fastest-growing sectors. One of HSBC's buy-rated picks is enterprise software and cybersecurity company Sangfor, listed in Shenzhen, with a price target of 143 yuan. The firm thinks accelerating AI adoption can help drive earnings growth. Chinese-developed DeepSeek surprised global investors in late January with its ability to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT, while claiming a fraction of development cost. In the months since, several Chinese companies have also released new AI tools for generating video or 3D models. China's recent tech breakthroughs stem from the country's breadth of engineers, data and vast social media and e-commerce ecosystem, the Morgan Stanley analysts said, noting how government support can enable faster tech adoption. ""We continue to believe that such structural improvement would be less susceptible to the ongoing tariff dispute and the overall macro challenges,"" the report said. “This is important in attracting foreign investors to build long-term commitments of allocation, as they discover a decent number of companies that are distinctive and exclusively available in China, despite the broad macro slowdown.” Listed Chinese stocks generate the majority of their revenue domestically, with only 3% U.S. revenue exposure, the analysts said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/25/ai-drives-growth-for-a-few-chinese-companies-analysts-share-picks.html,Business

"INVESTOR DEADLINE APPROACHING: Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Investigates Claims on Behalf of Investors of Organon","Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $75,000 In Organon To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options

If you suffered losses exceeding $75,000 in Organon between October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

NEW YORK, May 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Organon & Co. (“Organon” or the “Company”) (NYSE: OGN) and reminds investors of the July 22, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Organon’s prioritization of its capital allocation strategy through regular, quarterly dividends. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, reassurance that capital allocation through the aforementioned dividends was a “#1 capital allocation priority” and that Organon was committed to consistent deployment of capital. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of the Company’s priorities, particularly, related to capital allocation through quarterly dividends. Notably, Defendants concealed the high priority of Organon’s debt reduction strategy following the Company’s acquisition of Dermavant, resulting in a 70% decrease for the regular quarterly dividend. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Organon’s securities at artificially inflated prices.

Investors and analysts again reacted promptly to Organon’s revelations. The price of Organon’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $12.93 per share on April 30, 2025, Organon’s stock price fell to $9.45 per share on May 1, 2025, a decline of more than 27% in the span of just a single day.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Organon’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

To learn more about the Organon & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/OGN or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

"ROSEN, A LEADING INVESTOR RIGHTS LAW FIRM, Encourages Open Lending Corporation Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – LPRO","NEW YORK, May 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Open Lending Corporation (NASDAQ: LPRO) between February 24, 2022 and March 31, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important June 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Open Lending securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Open Lending class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=39014 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose materially adverse facts about Open Lending’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants: (1) misrepresented the capabilities of Open Lending’s risk-based pricing models; (2) issued materially misleading statements regarding Open Lending’s profit share revenue; (3) failed to disclose Open Lending’s 2021 and 2022 vintage loans had become worth significantly less than their corresponding outstanding loan balances; (4) misrepresented the underperformance of Open Lending’s 2023 and 2024 vintage loans; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Open Lending’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Open Lending class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=39014 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

What To Expect in the Markets This Week,"Key Takeaways Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick’s Sporting Goods.

Friday’s PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.

Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week’s holiday-shortened calendar as investors continue to evaluate the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's personal consumption expenditures inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar, including Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, New York Fed President John Williams, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting are also expected on Wednesday.

Nvidia Earnings Highlight Slate of Tech, Retail, Financial Reports This Week

Nvidia is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The chipmaking giant recently returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization level after its share price rallied by around 50% from its April low. The earnings report follows the company’s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported 78% year-over-year revenue growth in its prior earnings release. Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology is also scheduled to report this week.

Salesforce’s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider reported 8% revenue growth in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had strong potential for growth.

Thursday’s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it grew server and networking sales by 37% in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP’s scheduled report on Wednesday.

Costco Wholesale is on Thursday’s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco reported a 9% revenue growth in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.

AutoZone’s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an upgrade from Bank of America Securities as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick’s Sporting Goods’ expected report on Wednesday follows its recent deal to acquire sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).

Investors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which competes with Tesla (TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Inflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus

Friday’s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is closely watching prices in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.

Wednesday’s expected release of the minutes of the May meeting of the FOMC will provide more insight into Fed officials’ deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.

Revisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the economy shrank in the first three months of 2025.

The state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that consumers’ moods have soured over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday’s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy.",https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-the-markets-this-week-11740240,Business

Investors have until June 3, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Viatris securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and is captioned Quinn v. Viatris Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-466.

Why was Viatris Sued for Securities Fraud?

Viatris is a global healthcare company that supplies medicines to about 1 billion patients across more than 165 countries and territories. The complaint alleges that Viatris stated its facilities were in “good operating condition,” were “suitable for their intended purposes,” and that the Company was “committed to maintaining the highest quality manufacturing standards.”

However, on December 23, 2024, the Company revealed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had issued a Warning Letter following a failed inspection at the Company’s Indore, India, facility. Still, Viatris downplayed the situation, describing it as a “little bit of headwind” and spoke about “active discussions with the FDA” to get additional products produced at the facility exempted from the FDA’s Import Alert.

In truth, the ramifications of the failed FDA inspection resulted in a significant headwind to the Company’s financial results as it prevented the Company from manufacturing and distributing key products, including Lenalidomide.

The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed

On February 27, 2025, the Company released its Q4 2024 results and provided 2025 guidance. The Company revealed that the “negative impact” of the Indore facility’s failed inspection would lower 2025 revenue by “approximately $500 million” and 2025 earnings from operations by “approximately $385 million.” The Company further disclosed that the failed inspection at its Indore facility prevented it from identifying alternative supply options for Lenalidomide and from obtaining further product exemptions from the FDA. On this news, the price of Viatris stock declined roughly 15% during the trading day, from a closing price of $11.24 per share on February 26, 2025, to $9.53 per share on February 27, 2025.

You may have been Affected by Fraud and are Urged to Contact BFA Law (NYSE:ELV)","NEW YORK, May 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc.

Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092.

Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud?

Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility.

During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid.

As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024.

The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed

On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024.

Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and is captioned Priewe v. BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-00623.

Why was BigBear.ai Sued for Securities Fraud?

BigBear.ai is an AI-driven technology solutions company that helps organizations operationalize AI by analyzing complex data and providing actionable insights in areas of national security, supply chain management, and digital identity and biometrics solutions.

BigBear.ai went public via a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) transaction, completing merging first with GigCapital4 Merger Sub Corporation, and subsequently with GigCapital4, Inc. Upon completion of the merger, BigBear.ai issued $200 million of unsecured convertible notes with a maturity date of December 15, 2026. During the relevant period, BigBear.ai improperly accounted for the 2026 Convertible Notes, causing it to misstate various items in several of the Company’s previously issued financial statements.

"IBM, Lockheed Martin Team Reports Quantum Simulation is Closing Gap Between Theory and Experiment in Modeling Methylene","Insider Brief

IBM and Lockheed Martin researchers used a 52-qubit quantum processor to simulate the singlet and triplet states of the methylene (CH₂) molecule, marking the first application of the SQD method to an open-shell system.

The quantum results closely matched high-accuracy classical and experimental benchmarks, with the singlet-triplet energy gap calculated at 19 milli-Hartree, near the experimental value of 14 milli-Hartree.

The study highlights both the promise and current limitations of SQD, particularly in modeling strongly correlated systems, and points to its potential for near-term quantum advantage in chemistry.

A joint team from IBM and Lockheed Martin has taken a step forward in using quantum computing to tackle the accurate simulation of open-shell molecules like methylene — one of chemistry’s more stubborn computational challenges. According to a recent study published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, the researchers used quantum hardware to calculate the energies of the ground-state triplet and excited-state singlet of the methylene (or CH₂) molecule with surprising accuracy — bringing quantum methods closer to practical utility in electronic structure calculations.

According to the team, the findings mark the first successful application of a quantum-centric technique to an open-shell system, a class of molecules known for their computational complexity due to unpaired electrons and multi-configurational wavefunctions. The research team used a method called sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD), implemented on a 52-qubit processor, to compute the singlet-triplet energy gap of methylene. Their results matched closely with high-accuracy classical benchmarks and experimental data.

Ultimately, this is important because it indicates that quantum computers are nearing the point that they can tackle real, chemically relevant challenges, according to the team.

“The new research marks the first application of the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) technique to open-shell systems — an important milestone for quantum chemistry and its applications in aerospace, sensing and materials design,” IBM researchers Javier Robledo-Moreno, Gavin Jones, Roberto Lo Nardo and Robert Davis write in a blog post on the work. “IBM researchers believe that SQD is a prime candidate for near-term demonstrations of quantum advantage, as it allows researchers to combine the best of high-performance quantum computers and high-performance classical computers in tackling interesting simulation problems.”

Moving Past the Limits of Classical Chemistry

Open-shell molecules such as methylene have long presented a formidable challenge in computational chemistry. Traditional methods like density functional theory and Hartree-Fock often fail to capture the subtleties of these systems, especially when electron correlation effects become significant. The most accurate classical techniques, including full configuration interaction (FCI) and selected configuration interaction (SCI), are computationally expensive and impractical for anything but the smallest molecules.

However, quantum computing can natively simulate the behavior of electrons, offering a potentially more efficient path to high-accuracy results. The SQD method, used in this study, samples bit-string representations of electronic states and reconstructs molecular wavefunctions from quantum measurements. While earlier applications of SQD had focused on closed-shell molecules and molecular complexes, this study extended the method to the more complex case of methylene’s open-shell ground state.

Method and Results

The researchers modeled the CH₂ molecule as a six-electron system across 23 orbitals, encoded using 52 qubits. Calculations were performed on IBM’s quantum processor (ibm_nazca) using a compact quantum chemistry model — specifically, a Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz — to generate initial guesses for the molecular wavefunction. Post-processing involved a self-consistent error recovery method to mitigate quantum noise and improve particle number conservation.

They calculated the potential energy surfaces for both the singlet and triplet states across a range of C–H bond lengths. The energy results calculated with the SQD quantum method for the singlet state were extremely close — just a tiny fraction off — from the trusted values produced by advanced classical methods, showing the quantum approach was highly accurate. The results for the triplet form of the molecule were slightly less accurate but still impressively close — on average, just a small difference near the stable bond length (about 7 milli-Hartree).

Most importantly, the energy gap between the two forms of the molecule, as calculated by the quantum method, was much closer to what experiments show (19 milli-Hartree vs. 14 milli-Hartree) than what conventional techniques predicted (24 milli-Hartree), showing the quantum approach may be capturing the underlying physics more accurately.

Implications for Aerospace and Defense

Methylene, while simple, is chemically significant in fields like combustion and interstellar chemistry. Accurately modeling such radicals could improve simulations in areas ranging from rocket plume diagnostics to chemical sensing and environmental monitoring. The successful use of quantum hardware for these calculations suggests that similar approaches could eventually apply to larger, more complex systems relevant to aerospace and defense applications.

For defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, the ability to model transient or hazardous molecules using quantum simulations could lead to more predictive and safer material design workflows.

Limitations and Future Directions

Despite the promising results, the team recognized some limitations. For example, the study highlighted performance degradation in modeling the triplet state at larger bond distances, where the electronic wavefunction becomes more dispersed and harder to capture with the current quantum sampling strategy. The researchers noted that the SQD method’s accuracy hinges on effective bit-string recovery and the representational capacity of the quantum ansatz, both of which are strained in regions of strong static correlation. In other words, the quantum method works best when it can clean up noisy results and accurately represent the molecule’s behavior, but that gets harder when the electrons are strongly interacting and the system becomes more complex.

To address this, the team suggests developing new methods to generate more diverse spin-configured samples and improving the algorithm’s ability to represent multi-reference wavefunctions. Enhancements to the quantum error correction and symmetry recovery procedures could also extend the method’s applicability to larger systems.

Toward Utility-Scale Chemistry

This study might be an important step in what’s been an incredibly long journey toward utility-scale quantum chemistry. By demonstrating that a hybrid quantum-classical approach can yield chemically accurate results for an open-shell system using current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, the work lays a foundation for future applications.

If scaled up, these techniques could eventually be used to study larger radicals, transition metal complexes, and other chemically and industrially relevant systems that remain out of reach for conventional methods. As quantum hardware improves and error rates decline, quantum-centric approaches like SQD may become a go-to tool for scientists and engineers working in chemically demanding fields.

The study signals that quantum computing, long considered a speculative tool for chemistry, is beginning to prove its worth — even under our current noisy, resource-limited era of quantum computing.

The IBM team writes: “This study shows that quantum computers are starting to deliver value in real chemical simulations — not just toy problems or idealized systems. As quantum hardware continues to improve and methods like SQD mature, we’re opening the door to modeling complex reaction dynamics and designing better materials with the help of quantum tools.”",https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/05/25/ibm-lockheed-martin-team-reports-quantum-simulation-is-closing-gap-between-theory-and-experiment-in-modeling-methylene/,Business
'I wish I could have started my dream job as train driver at 18',"'Age is just a number for becoming a train driver'

9 hours ago Share Save Victoria Cook & Bhavani Vadde BBC London Share Save

BBC Liam says he would have 'bitten the hand' off someone offering him a train driving job at 18, but he had to wait until he was older, due to the old rules

Meet 27-year-old train driver, Liam Mackenzie. He works at Southern Railway and has done so since he was 18. But he has not always been in his dream job. That's because, until recently, drivers had to be 20 to begin training. Now that is changing, and the age is being lowered to 18. ""Since I was young I always wanted to do this. My dad worked on the railway, his dad worked on the railway, and my brother did for a small time too, so this has always been in the forefront of my mind,"" said Liam.

'Intensive training'

Liam started his railway career as a platform conductor and waited until he was old enough to start the intensive train driver training. When the time came the process started with six months in a training school and tests every month. This was followed by an assignment to a depot and 225 hours of train driving experience with a dedicated instructor - 40 of which had to be done at night. The practical training was accompanied by an ""intensive programme"" of theoretical study, Liam said. ""You have to go and learn your routes - tunnel names, signalling areas - you name it, you have to know it,"" he added. Liam said this process ended with the final test: ""You get a week-long exam with a competency assessor who will eventually sign you off, if you're competent to drive alone. ""That's a really intense week - that's everything you know - you have to show them you know.""

Liam says the training is ""intensive"" but he ""absolutely loves it""

In terms of lowering the age for new drivers, Liam said: ""I think it's a great thing. ""If you pass all the assessments you are showing you've got the mental strength and the concentration and all the traits you need to do it - so the age just becomes a number. ""In other industries you can start at 18 - like bus driving. You can drive a car at 18,"" he added. The rail industry faces the problem of replacing a growing number of people retiring with new recruits, the Department for Transport (DfT) said. It said the average age of a UK train driver is currently 48, with 30% set to reach retirement age by 2029, meaning more drivers are urgently needed. Opening up the recruitment pool to 18 and 19 year olds ""unlocks thousands of jobs,"" the government said. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, said the industry had previously ""missed out"" on young people wanting to become train drivers ""as they don't wait around until they turn 20 to find a career"". The Rail Safety and Standards Board said its research found ""18 year olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers"".

'Absolutely love it'

Liam reflects on his own journey to becoming a train driver. ""I would have loved to drive trains at 18 - I would have bitten the hand off someone to get the opportunity to do this at 18."" ""For me, it's a great career, I don't mind the early wake ups, the late going to beds - it gives me a bit more control over my life. I absolutely love it."" Showing off the controls of a Southern Railway train, Liam says he gets a ""real sense of pride of getting people where they need to be in a safe manner... preferably on time too!""

"With 7 Words, the Pilot on Our Delayed Delta Air Lines Flight Won Over a Plane Full of Cranky Passengers","No one likes flight delays. Nothing takes away the joy of traveling quite like waiting around for a flight that isn’t leaving because of weather, maintenance, or crew issues—especially if you have a tight connection to make.

Somehow, delays feel even worse when you’re already on the plane. It’s one thing to sit in the airport wondering when your flight is going to leave, but at least there you have the option of passing the time by grabbing something to eat. It’s another to find out your flight is delayed after boarding is completed, bags are stowed, and seat belts are fastened. At that point, you’re just sitting there waiting for someone up front to tell you what’s going on. That was the case this week on a Delta Air Lines flight I took from Grand Rapids to Minneapolis on my way to Mountain View, California, for Google I/O. Because of weather over parts of the Midwest, a thing that regularly disrupts travel in these parts, our flight was delayed at the gate for an hour or so. Travel delays happen In the grand scheme of things, that’s not the worst thing that can happen. It’s not even the worst delay I’ve ever experienced. For that matter, it wasn’t even the worst delay I experienced on that trip.

Featured Video An Inc.com Featured Presentation

Of course, most of the people on the flight were headed somewhere beyond Minneapolis, which meant every extra minute we sat on the ground was a minute closer to missing a connection. You could feel the tension—passengers staring at their watches, refreshing airline apps, sighing loudly, and shifting uncomfortably in their seats. After we had all boarded and settled into the growing frustration of the unknown, the pilot stepped out of the cockpit, walked into the cabin, stood where we could all see him, and addressed the entire plane face-to-face. “I want to start with an apology,” he said.

Just one sentence—seven words, to be precise—is all it took to make a huge difference in the overall experience for everyone on board. Nothing about the delay was his fault. Pilots don’t schedule thunderstorms or control air traffic flow. He hadn’t caused the delay, and he certainly wasn’t to blame for the chain reaction it was causing in all of our carefully planned travel itineraries. But he still began with an apology. In that moment, the mood on the plane shifted. The pilot didn’t magically make the delay go away, and it didn’t guarantee that everyone would make their connection, but it did something almost as powerful—it made everyone feel seen. It made everyone on the plane feel like someone understood how frustrating the situation was and cared enough to acknowledge it. What the captain did at that moment offers three lessons every leader should remember:

He came to us In most situations like this, you get a robotic announcement piped in through a scratchy intercom. “We’re currently waiting for an update from air traffic control. We’ll keep you posted.” It’s impersonal. Detached. Forgettable. But this pilot did something different—he came out of the cockpit and he looked us in the eyes. He didn’t hide behind a wall or a title. That simple act changed everything. In any leadership situation, showing up in person matters. Walking into the room and standing with the people you’re responsible for makes a statement. It says: ‘I’m here with you, not above you.’ That presence builds credibility—and connection.

He started with empathy “I want to start with an apology.” That sentence does more than express regret. It signals empathy. It tells people you understand their perspective—that you see how they’re affected and that you care. That’s a powerful kind of leadership that doesn’t require a long speech. It doesn’t even require fixing the problem immediately (which often isn’t even possible). It just requires acknowledging that the problem exists and that it affects real people. In moments of stress, frustration, or uncertainty, starting with empathy disarms defensiveness. People stop assuming the worst. They stop looking for someone to blame. And they start listening.

He made it clear he was on our side After apologizing, the captain went on to explain the situation. He talked about the weather systems moving across the region. Then, he explained that while the ground delay was frustrating, it was actually better than being sent into a holding pattern mid-air or diverted later. Finally, he assured us that the crew was doing everything possible to speed things up while keeping us safe. Great leaders don’t just acknowledge problems. They make it clear that they’re going to do what they can to help. Even if the solution isn’t perfect, knowing someone’s in your corner makes a world of difference. Eventually, our flight took off, and we all arrived in Minneapolis. We didn’t make up much time, but several passengers were rebooked before landing thanks to the heads-up from the crew. More importantly, no one got off that plane angry.

Because of one sentence—seven words, spoken sincerely by a leader who showed up, showed empathy, and showed he cared. In a world full of frustration, delay, and disconnection, that’s the kind of leadership people remember.

‘Pay here’: the QR code ‘quishing’ scam targeting drivers,"You park the car and look for somewhere to pay. A large QR code on the machine offers to take you directly to the right website where you put in your card details before going on with your day. Only much later are you hit with the double whammy: money gone from your account, and a fine for not paying the genuine parking company.

The rise in app- and phone-based parking payment has opened a new frontier for fraudsters: quishing – so called because they are phishing attacks that start with a QR code. The fraudsters stick the codes in places where you would expect to see details of how to pay to park. When you scan one, it takes you to a site where you are asked for your payment details – as you would expect when booking parking.

One victim who scanned a code in a station car park told the BBC that the fraudsters tried to take payments then posed as her bank to get more information from her, before running up £13,000 worth of debt in her name.

Last year, the UK’s Action Fraud received 1,386 reports of scams involving QR codes – a small number, but more than double that in the previous year. In just the first three months of 2025 there were 502, suggesting the problem is growing.

Chris Ainsley, the head of fraud risk management at Santander UK, says it is hard to get a full picture of the scale of the fraud. “Unless drivers receive a parking ticket, a lot of people are unaware that their personal or card details were compromised in this way,” he says. “When it comes to reporting the eventual scam, often the fact that it originated through quishing goes undocumented.”

What the scam looks like

A QR code where you might expect to see one – on a parking charge machine, on a post in a car park or sometimes on a public EV charger.

View image in fullscreen Be suspicious of any QR code on a parking payment machine or signpost in a car park. Check that it has not been stuck over a legitimate code. Photograph: dowell/Getty Images

The code will be on a sticker.

What the messages ask for

The website will ask for your payment details. It will also ask for your car details, but that is likely to be just an attempt to convince you it is a legitimate parking website.

You may later get a call from someone pretending to be from your bank who will use the information you have given and tell you that you have been defrauded and need to move your money to a safe account. The safe account is actually in the control of the scammers. Do not do as they ask – your real bank would never request this.

What to do

Be suspicious of any QR code on a parking payment machine or signpost in a car park. Check that it has not been stuck over a legitimate code.

If you have the right parking app already on your phone, use that rather than scanning a code.

Use cash or a card to pay at a machine if those are an option.

Check the URL of the website before you click on it – it should appear on your phone as you scan the code. Do not click on it if it looks suspicious.

When you land on a page through a QR code, check details to make sure it is not a fraudulent version. Giveaways include weird URLs and bad spelling. Check that the URL includes HTTPS, rather than HTTP, before handing over details.

Keep an eye on your bank account and report any suspicious payments to your bank.

Report the scam to the local council, police and car park owner if it is a private company.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/may/25/qr-code-scam-what-is-quishing-drivers-app-phone-parking-payment,Business

Reddit

What happened? On Monday, Wells Fargo downgraded Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) to Equal-weight with a $115 price target.

*TLDR: Reddit faces AI-driven user pressure. Growth outlook dims.

What’s the full story? Wells Fargo anticipates Reddit’s user base faces structural challenges as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) integrates AI-driven search features, likely pressuring logged-out user engagement and, subsequently, ad revenue. The bank forecasts ad revenue to fall 6% and 14% below consensus in 2026 and 2027, respectively, with EBITDA trailing by 2% and 15%. Logged-out users, accounting for 55% of the total user base but just 15% of ad revenue, remain critical for scale and long-term growth. However, their engagement—20% of logged-in users’ time—is concentrated on low-ad-load comment pages, limiting monetization.

Wells Fargo slashes the three-year logged-in DAU growth outlook to 10% from 13%, citing reduced user acquisition potential. The bank doubts Reddit can meet ad growth expectations on logged-in users alone, as achieving Meta-like monetization appears unrealistic.

Reddit’s high-margin data licensing business, while lucrative, conflicts with community health and ad-based monetization, posing long-term risks. The bank warns of disintermediation as AI-powered search increasingly bypasses Reddit, delivering direct answers sourced from its data. Wells Fargo suggests Reddit prioritize internal monetization of its content and data over licensing revenue, despite forgoing ~$150M in incremental high-margin income.

The bank sees Reddit’s path to a 15% annual return—requiring a 25% revenue CAGR and 15x FY28 EBITDA multiple—as overly ambitious, given the challenges ahead.

Hewlett Packard Enterprises

What happened? On Tuesday, Evercore upgraded HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) to Outperform with a $22 price target.

*TLDR: HPE upgraded; upside to $30. Multiple catalysts drive value.

What’s the full story? Evercore upgrades Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) to Outperform, citing an attractive risk/reward profile with potential upside to $30 and downside support around $15.

The brokerage highlights four key scenarios: 1) The Juniper deal closes, driving double-digit EPS growth and a $23-24 stock price; 2) No Juniper deal but HPE improves margins via cost cuts, potentially reaching $26-31; 3) The Juniper deal fails, leaving HPE rangebound at $15-16; and 4) A sum-of-the-parts analysis suggests $25-30 in value from premium multiples in networking and storage. Evercore sees multiple pathways to upside, particularly for long-term investors.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/street-call-week-085151268.html,Business
3 Brilliant Stocks to Buy With $200 and Hold for 5 Years,"Hence, despite trading at a very rich valuation of 208 times forward earnings, Palantir's implementation-focused AI strategy and strong customer demand present an exceptional long-term opportunity for retail investors.

Customer adoption of the company's offerings has been strong. Walgreens Boots Alliance has automated nearly 384 billion daily decisions across 4,000 stores in eight months, while American International Group expects its five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to double after adopting Palantir's technology.

Unlike other AI players that focus on developing advanced foundational models, Palantir primarily concentrates on AI implementations, translating the capabilities of large language models into business outcomes. AIP enables enterprise autonomy, helping clients build autonomous AI agents for various tasks.

Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has positioned the company as providing a major ontology (a digital framework that links an organization's digital and real-world assets) and AI-powered operating system for commercial enterprises and government agencies.

Palantir's first-quarter results were impressive, with revenue rising 39% year over year to $884 million. The company's U.S. revenue grew even faster, at 55% year over year, and now accounts for almost 71% of the total business. Notably, the U.S. commercial business has also crossed the $1 billion annual revenue run rate in the first quarter.

Palantir Technologies ' (NASDAQ: PLTR) data mining and analytics platform helps unify, organize, and manage vast amounts of organizational data across various sources and formats to generate actionable insights. The company's earnings performance highlights the strong demand for its offerings.

You do not need substantial funds to take advantage of the current environment. Just $200 -- not kept aside for bills or emergency savings -- can be invested in any of these artificial intelligence (AI)-powered stocks for at least the next five years.

The U.S. equity market has experienced high volatility so far in 2025, driven by aggressive tariff policies, ongoing trade wars, rising interest rates, and shifting investor behaviors. Yet, this period has also presented opportunities to acquire reasonably priced, high-quality stocks.

Story Continues

SoundHound AI

SoundHound AI's (NASDAQ: SOUN) recent earnings performance has also been stellar. With revenue surging 151% year over year to $29.1 million, and none of its customers accounting for more than 10% of the total revenue, the company has built a high-growth and well-diversified business.

SoundHound has created a sustainable competitive moat with its proprietary multimodal and multilingual Polaris foundation model, which supports 30 languages and delivers 4 times better latency, twice the sentence accuracy in noisy environments, and 35% better word error rates. Consequently, the company is well-positioned to capture share in the global voice and speech recognition market, estimated to grow from $19.1 billion in 2025 to $81.6 billion by 2030.

Furthermore, SoundHound's strategic acquisitions of SYNQ3, Allset, and Amelia have expanded the company's reach to nearly 13,000 restaurants, while also opening new cross-selling opportunities across several verticals. The company has recently introduced a voice commerce ecosystem that integrates conversational AI capabilities in vehicles, enabling hands-free ordering from restaurants while driving. This feature has generated significant interest from automakers and could become a substantial revenue stream in the years to come.

SoundHound's stock is down nearly 60% from its all-time high in December 2024. Coupled with multiple tailwinds, this discounted price appears to be the right time to buy this stock now.

UiPath

Shares of robotic process automation (RPA) player UiPath (NYSE: PATH) are currently down nearly 86% from their all-time high in May 2021. The company has suffered in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, despite its strong fundamentals.

In its recent earnings results (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, ended Jan. 31), UiPath's revenue was slightly below analyst estimates, primarily due to the timing of deal closures in the government business.

However, UiPath's strategic pivot toward agentic AI can prove to be a significant catalyst in the long run. Several of its agentic AI products, including Agent Builder, Agentic Orchestration, and Agentic Testing, are already seeing strong adoption trends. With Agent Builder, nearly 3,000 agents have been added to workflows to create mission-critical processes.

Agentic Orchestration is helping orchestrate specialized agents, robots, and people to execute goal-based tasks. Agentic Testing is also helping software testers improve productivity with agents. This approach to combining AI agents with traditional RPA has been a key differentiator for the company.

UiPath also boasts robust customer metrics, with a dollar-based gross retention rate of 98% and a dollar-based net retention rate of 110% in the fourth quarter. Additionally, while the total customer count remained flat year over year, high-value customers spending over $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased by 10% year over year, and those spending $5 million or more increased by 30% in the fourth quarter.

Finally, UiPath also has a robust balance sheet with $1.7 billion in cash and zero debt.

Despite the many advantages, UiPath trades at only 4.6 times sales, significantly lower than its three-year average of 6.9 times. Hence, considering the multiple tailwinds and low valuation, the stock is a worthwhile investment, even though the company has experienced a slowdown in its growth trajectory over the past few quarters.

"Are These 3 Top-Performing Tech Stocks in the Nasdaq-100, Up 33% to 64% in 2025, Still a Buy Now?","I'm not one to say things are impossible, but it's probably safe to say that Palantir has little, if any, short- or medium-term upside left. If you want to buy shares, take small nibbles. Otherwise, investors are probably wise to wait for a lower price to revisit the stock. Resist the fear of missing out (FOMO) -- this ship has likely sailed.

But as great as the business is doing, Palantir's stock price has outrun its fundamentals. The stock now trades at possibly Wall Street's highest valuation. Palantir's enterprise value is nearly $280 billion today on just $3.1 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. Growth would need to continue accelerating and sustain that pace for years to make sense of the current stock price.

Palantir has been around for over 20 years, but the company has entered a new era of accelerating growth since launching its AIP platform, designed for AI applications, in mid-2023. Palantir's business has continued to perform better since then, and there is a wide-open market opportunity ahead, since its software could help almost any large organization.

You don't achieve such scorching-hot returns without a good reason, and Palantir tells a great story. The company specializes in developing custom software that uses AI to analyze data to identify trends, optimize processes, or aid in real-time decisions. Management likes to say that Palantir augments human intelligence, not replaces it.

Justin Pope (Palantir Technologies): There hasn't been a hotter artificial intelligence (AI) stock than Palantir Technologies. On top of its epic 64% year-to-date gains, the stock has rocketed over 1,800% higher since 2023.

Nobody likes missing the boat, so three Fool.com contributors investigated whether buying these stocks today is still wise.

However, that's not the case for all the stocks within it. Some of the world's leading technology companies, like Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), have surged between 33% and 64% since January -- it's not even June yet!

The U.S. stock market has been volatile in 2025. The Nasdaq-100 , which includes many of America's leading technology companies, is roughly flat year to date.

A desire to minimize tariff exposure is yet another reason to own MercadoLibre stock.

Palantir Technologies has left orbit, but it may return to Earth sooner rather than later.

Story Continues

It is time to stop ignoring this Latin American juggernaut

Will Healy (MercadoLibre): In terms of returns in 2025, MercadoLibre is a top performer, rising 54% so far this year. Despite that considerable gain, it likely has more room to run.

MercadoLibre is a conglomerate that operates exclusively in Latin America. It drives revenue in e-commerce, fintech, and logistics, as these enterprises work separately and together to bolster the company's competitive advantage.

One of MercadoLibre's attributes right now is a comparative lack of exposure to the U.S. Outside of a distribution center in Texas that brings U.S. goods to Mexican consumers, it has no direct ties to the U.S. That means tariffs are unlikely to significantly affect the company's performance.

Moreover, MercadoLibre thrives on Latin America's challenges, making it antifragile. For example, many in the region are unbanked or underbanked, so it established Mercado Pago to help these customers buy online. Mercado Pago was so successful that it opened to customers not buying on the MercadoLibre site.

Also, the region's lack of shipping options led it to create Mercado Envios. As a result, many of its markets now have greater access to same-day or next-day shipping. Additionally, MercadoLibre has leveraged its web presence to earn revenue from digital advertising from its Mercado Ads business.

Its rapid growth led it to generate revenues of $5.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 37% rise from year-ago levels. Also, costs and expenses grew at a slightly slower pace, meaning its $494 million in net income for Q1 increased by 44%.

Despite those improvements and the rise in the stock price, its valuation is coming off multiyear lows, with its P/E ratio at 63.

That valuation may make MercadoLibre appear expensive. Nonetheless, such an earnings multiple is not unusual when one takes into account the growth of similar companies like Amazon and Sea Limited.

Ultimately, when considering the state of MercadoLibre, its valuation, antifragility, and minimal exposure to tariffs likely make it an excellent stock to buy despite its rapid growth in recent months.

This streaming giant is on fire

Jake Lerch (Netflix): For me, Netflix is a top-performing Nasdaq-100 stock that is too good to ignore.

As of this writing, Netflix stock is up 33% year to date. That's impressive, but it's even more so after considering that the company's stock dropped 19% during the stock market correction that began in February.

Since then, Netflix's stock has recouped all its losses -- and then some. As of May 21, the stock now trades at nearly $1,200 per share.

Netflix's fundamentals are just as remarkable as its stock performance. Consider the company's trailing-12-month profit margin. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on March 31), Netflix's profit margin rose to 23%. Not only is that the highest level in the company's more than two-decade history, it's almost double the profit margin Netflix reported two years ago.

What's driving this increasing profitability? In short, Netflix is flexing its corporate power in several ways.

First, the company estimates its viewing audience at over 700 million worldwide. This enormous user base spans the globe, with more than 450 million outside the U.S. This geographic diversity helps bolster Netflix's appeal among advertisers, who may wish to target audiences based on their location or viewing habits. That's all the more important now that Netflix has launched its ad-supported plan.

Second, Netflix is driving its profits higher with a time-tested method: It's raising prices. The company announced a price hike in January 2025, the first since 2022. This most recent price hike shows the company's confidence that subscribers will stick around, thanks to the company's expanded slate of content, including live events like sports.

To sum up, Netflix's stock has been on a tear this year. It's already up more than 33% and could move much higher as the company continues to rev up its profitability thanks to its huge audience and higher prices for its service. Investors looking for a hot Nasdaq-100 stock shouldn't ignore Netflix.

"In India's congested cities, delivery apps cash in","Armies of 'dabbawalas' crisscross Mumbai by foot and bicycle, delivering food to office workers who are keen to avoid the searing heat and traffic

Now, across the country, young entrepreneurs are taking that tradition to the next level with the explosion of shopping apps that allow customers to get hold of not only food and drink but anything else from clothes to iPhones -- within minutes.

The so-called quick commerce apps are redefining the retail game, not only disrupting e-commerce titans such as Amazon with their speed and efficiency but also long-established ""mom and pop"" stores which are no longer convenient enough.

At a warehouse managed by online grocer BigBasket in central Mumbai, employees work with military-like precision to pull off deliveries in just 10 minutes.

These warehouses are known within the industry as ""dark stores"", a reference to being closed off to customers.

When a new order is received, a worker leaps into action, darting through aisles filled with everything from fizzy drinks to vegetables, packing a bag of groceries handed to a motorbike rider -- the modern-day ""dabbawala"", Hindi for ""lunchbox man"".

Local tech companies have poured in billions to set up these nifty logistical networks across big cities, fuelling India's rapid shopping industry.

'Unprecedented'

For millions of customers, it's an easy way to avoid shopping in the sweltering heat -- visiting multiple food stalls -- and spending hours navigating the country's notorious traffic jams.

Companies say India's quick commerce's growth is partly down to the sheer scale of people living in tight-packed cities within a roughly two kilometre © Indranil MUKHERJEE / AFP

Growth has been ""very strong"", BigBasket co-founder Vipul Parekh told AFP, pointing to forecasts that indicate a compounded annual growth rate of more than 60 percent over the next two to three years.

""When you talk of a large industry transforming and growing at this pace, that is unprecedented,"" he said.

Delivery apps such as Getir or Jokr have faltered in Europe and the United States in recent years, as pandemic-induced demand wore off and rising inflation pinched customer wallets.

But sales in India have soared from $100 million in 2020 to an estimated $6 billion in 2024, according to projections by market analysis firm Datum Intelligence.

This could hit $40 billion by the end of the decade, according to investment bank JM Financial.

Companies say India's quick commerce's growth is partly down to the sheer scale of people living in tight-packed cities within a roughly two kilometre (one mile) radius of a ""dark store"", said Parekh.

""The revenue potential in that catchment is very high,"" he said.

A lack of many traditional supermarket grocery chains in India aid the business model, he said.

Rinish Ravindra, a regular user, admits that they make him ""lazy"", but argues that the convenience is unbeatable.

""I just press a bunch of keys and all of it comes delivered to home,"" says the 32-year-old, who works in Mumbai's film industry.

Local players have made rapid progress but competition is heating up.

Amazon is getting its act together, along with Walmart-owned Flipkart and billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries as they belatedly roll out rapid delivery offerings.

""One of the problems with e-commerce players like Amazon is that, until now, they've relied on these big fulfilment centres that sit on the outside or outskirts of cities,"" said Satish Meena of Datum Intelligence.

""These aren't suited for rapid delivery, which is why they now need to invest to build their own dark store networks within urban areas.""

'Just order it online'

However, a more crowded industry threatens the sustainability of the sector that has already seen one prominent start-up go bust.

The quick commerce sector could also face challenges from thousands of small, family-run shops © Indranil MUKHERJEE / AFP

""My sense is that the market is good enough for two to three players,"" said Rahul Malhotra of Bernstein, a research firm, adding that the total addressable market may be worth around $50-$60 billion.

""Some of the early movers, with hyperlocal capabilities obviously, have an advantage here.""

The sector could also face challenges from thousands of small, family-run shops.

The Confederation of All India Traders, a leading industry group that claims to represent over 90 million small businesses, has called for ""a nationwide movement"" against newer platforms.

Its president likened quick commerce to being a ""modern-day East India Company"", a reference to the rapacious British power that began in the 17th century to seize swathes of India, preceding colonial rule.

For now, customers are voting with their wallets.

""When I think of groceries I think, 'I can just order it online',"" said Ravindra.

An all-weather stock for this volatile market and economy that even thrived during the financial crisis,"We're adding an auto-parts stock with a history of resiliency and a current business that could benefit from tariffs to our All-Weather stock list . The goal of the All-Weather list is to use our CNBC Pro resources — top Wall Street analyst research, stock screening tools of the Pros — to identify stocks that can thrive in any type of market or economy. We launched the list in February as we grew more concerned about the bull market. President Donald Trump reignited market turmoil on Friday and gave investors reason again to seek out these types of durable investments. Let's review how the list is doing so far this year: (Values are accurate as of May 23 1:00 pm ET) A stock market rebound from the turmoil in April, bringing the S & P 500 back almost into the green for the year, has overall hurt the performance of the list. These are stocks for a tumultuous market and economy and will probably do best if the S & P 500 starts to struggle again. Nonetheless, there are plenty of winners in the group with Netflix the best among them, a stock we chose because it has become America's affordable entertainment option of choice. Waste Management, with its resilient revenue line, is also a winner and got an upgrade on Friday from JPMorgan. The worst performer, albeit not by that much, is the durable dividend stock exchange-traded fund. I think in normal rough markets that fund would be doing much better, but rising yields are making dividend stocks less attractive. Why buy a dividend stock when a 10-year Treasury will give you 4.5%? Typically, rates fall during rough stock market periods and dividend stocks become a safe haven, but that hasn't been the case this year. New addition: AutoZone AutoZone (AZO) was upgraded by Bank of America to buy from hold on Wednesday and the firm raised its price target to $4,800 from $3,900. That would represent a gain of about 25% from current levels. AutoZone is a consistent stock winner gaining every year since the pandemic and Bank of America believes that consistency will continue this year even with a cash-strapped consumer, a slowing economy and higher tariff rates raising the cost of imported auto parts. On the tariffs specifically, Bank of America sees that as a potential tailwind even as it raises costs for AutoZone. ""The auto aftermarket could benefit from lower new car sales and higher used car pricing, as consumers may hold onto and repair existing vehicles,"" wrote analyst Robert Ohmes in the Monday note. ""We think consumers will be more willing to pay the extra cost to fix their existing vehicles than purchasing new vehicles, especially when the auto tariffs could mean a $3,285 increase on average for US-assembled vehicles and higher for imported vehicles."" AZO YTD mountain Autozone, YTD But what Ohmes found about AutoZone's trading history is what really caught our eye. He pointed out that the stock, along with competitor O'Reilly Automotive, were up more than 100% versus the S & P 500 during 2008 to 2009. ""If unemployment rises and new car sales fall, these trends will drive people into new behavior,"" wrote Ohmes. Do-it-yourself ""could feel a stronger tailwind as consumers realize they can save labor cost if they perform a job on their own."" AutoZone is well liked by most of Wall Street with 23 buy ratings and zero sell calls, according to CNBC Pro's analyst tool.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/25/an-all-weather-stock-for-this-volatile-market-and-economy-that-even-thrived-during-the-financial-crisis.html,Business
My family of 5 took an RV trip in New Zealand for a week. We saved money on groceries and free campsites and splurged on sightseeing.,"The author and her family spent over a week in New Zealand traveling in an RV.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

With its stunning mountains, picturesque lakes, and star-filled skies, New Zealand's South Island is truly spectacular. My family of five recently traveled there and hit the road in an RV for eight nights to celebrate my 40th birthday and make some epic memories together.

Renting an RV proved to be a popular way to see the island, but it was also a pretty expensive way to travel. However, we did enjoy the convenience of having our accommodation, transport, and cooking facilities all in one.

We spent money on the RV itself

The RV cost us 3572 New Zealand Dollars (with the insurance factored in) for eight nights, about $2115, which is just over NZ$446 a night.

In addition, we paid for powered sites at caravan parks at least every second night so that we could access electricity for the portable heater and refill our water supply. Powered sites ranged in price from NZD$50 to NZD$110.

So, all in all, we spent up to NZ$556 a day on the RV alone, plus what we spent on fuel, which was more expensive than back home in Australia, where we live. The RV company also charged a mileage fee at the end of the trip, which worked out to be about NZD$170.

We didn't mind spending money on certain experiences

You can't go to the South Island and not see those iconic sites it's famous for. We splurged on experiences like boating around the fjords of Milford Sound, venturing into the Te Anau Glowworm Caves, and stargazing in Lake Takapō.

These experiences weren't cheap, especially for a family of five. But I felt like spending the money was totally worth it, because they were experiences we couldn't have elsewhere.

We also shelled out for treats along the way

We have three kids under 10 who love treats, so we definitely indulged on the trip. Often, we'd cook our main meals in the RV to save money, then have a treat out and about.

On our way north, we discovered an award-winning artisan ice cream shop in Arrowtown called Patagonia Chocolates, and on the return leg to Queenstown, we went back for seconds. There was also a quaint store full of treats in Arrowtown, the Remarkable Sweet Shop, and we spent far too much money on sugary delights.

However, we made sure to save by keeping groceries in the RV

We couldn't get over the cost of groceries in the center of Queenstown. It was outlandish compared to Australian prices. When we picked up our RV, I asked our taxi driver where to shop, and he recommended a low-price store called Pak'nSave. The prices were much more in line with our budget, and we stocked up for the week.

The office of the campground where we were staying in Queenstown also had a free community shelf where other travelers had left staples like salt, pepper, coffee, and so forth. We took what we needed and donated our leftover supplies at the end. It was a great system.

Living in an RV with a small fridge meant we had to be smart about our food storage and cooking. I planned out our meals in advance and made sure ingredients could be used in multiple dishes, which also saved money.

We also entertained ourselves for free in the great outdoors

New Zealand is the perfect place to immerse yourself in nature. A lot of our itinerary was about hikes and wholesome outdoor fun.

Highlights included the walk up Queenstown Hill for panoramic views of the area, watching sunsets on Lake Wakatipu, rock collecting with the kids, and hiking around Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park.

My absolute favorite experience was climbing Roy's Peak, near Wānaka, with my 9-year-old son. It was a challenging hike of roughly 10 miles, but the sweeping views at the top were spectacular.

We spent some time 'freedom camping'

Because the powered campsites cost up to NZD$110, we also saved money by ""freedom camping"" whenever we could, which is a kind of camping where you're allowed to stay on public land without paying a fee. However, there are specific rules for camping this way — for example, you must be in a self-contained vehicle with a toilet, wastewater tank, and trash facilities.

My favorite spot we did this was Lake Pukaki. We arrived at night and had the most spectacular view of the Milky Way. Then, we woke up surrounded by snow-covered mountains and a lake glistening in the sunlight. It was absolutely magical.

Overall, I loved the experience of traveling in an RV and would highly recommend it if your budget allows for it. The kids had a ball, and we made lasting memories that we will cherish forever.",https://www.businessinsider.com/family-rv-trip-new-zealand-save-spend-money-2025-5,Business

Netflix Thinks It Can Reach a Trillion-Dollar Market Cap by 2030. Here's What the Math Says.,"Key Points

Netflix's management reportedly believes it can double revenue and triple operating income by 2030.

The company is increasing prices and building out its advertising service.

It can hit these goals, but it is unclear if the company will be worth $1 trillion by 2030.

10 stocks we like better than Netflix ›

The world is Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX) oyster. That is what it has felt like over the past few years as the company has sucked all the oxygen out of the video streaming market.

Its global presence and huge catalog of content give it a competitive advantage over streaming rivals, which is why viewers flock to the service. Revenue continues to march higher, while profits are soaring.

Management does not think the growth party is over just yet. According to reporting from The Wall Street Journal, Netflix is aiming to reach a market cap of $1 trillion by 2030, which would be around double its current level at $500 billion. Here's the math behind the analysis and whether the company can hit these targets by the end of the decade.

Global expansion and pricing power

Video streaming processed through the cloud has turned the media sector into a truly worldwide game. Netflix has taken advantage of this global pie, investing to produce video specifically in markets such as Europe, Latin America, South Korea, and India.

This global expansion is why it eclipsed 300 million total subscribers at the end of 2024, making it the largest pure-play premium video streamer in the world. With a global population of 8 billion and rising use of the internet every year, there is plenty of room to expand its total subscribers in the years to come.

Another factor for Netflix's success is pricing power. In the U.S., its premium subscription tier has gone from $11.99 a month in 2013 to $24.99 currently. This more than doubling in monthly subscription fees has helped revenue grow by close to 600% in the last 10 years.

More importantly, it has helped the company gain some operating leverage over its cost base, with operating income inflecting higher to $11.3 billion in the last few years. Free cash flow is now positive at $7.5 billion over the last 12 months, giving the company the flexibility to keep pushing for more growth globally.

Sports and advertisements

By 2030, Netflix wants its advertising tier to generate around $9 billion in global ad sales, up from an estimated $2 billion currently. This advertising tier was launched in 2023 and is a huge driver of new sign-ups for Netflix.

As it rolls out globally, it will hopefully see even more customers sign up. Advertising has historically been a huge revenue driver for the media industry that Netflix decided to lay off of for a long while. Now, it is turning on this new revenue stream and hopes to see huge growth in the years to come.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-thinks-reach-trillion-dollar-224500173.html,Business
The world's wealthiest added another $2 trillion to their vaults this year: How to invest like them,"Ultra-high-net individuals spread their wealth across everything from stocks and real estate to private equity and bonds; in other words, diversifying is key. This reduces risk while increasing the chances for steady, long-term growth. For regular investors, diversifying with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds covering domestic and international markets is a good start. And don’t forget bonds for stability during market ups and downs.

You don’t need unlimited wealth to invest like a billionaire. The ultra-wealthy use strategy, smart decisions and balancing risk and reward to get ahead. Here’s how you can do the same.

But not every billionaire had a good year. Over 100 names dropped off the 2024 list, no longer rich enough to make the cut. Some notable exits include Lisa Su, CEO of semiconductor giant AMD, Sara Liu, co-founder of server company Supermicro and Nicholas Puech, heir to the Hermès luxury brand, who says his fortune has disappeared.

This year, 288 new names have joined the ranks of the world’s billionaires. Among them are celebrities like Bruce Springsteen ($1.2B), Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1.1B), and Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1B).

According to Forbes senior editor Chase Peterson-Withorn, the rise in billionaire wealth isn’t just about tech giants and luxury brands; it’s about how much power these individuals hold.

In short, the billionaire game is booming. Want in on the action? You might want to take notes from the world’s richest.

The wealthiest are led by Elon Musk, with $342 billion, followed by Mark Zuckerberg at $216 billion, and Jeff Bezos at $215 billion. Rounding out the top 10 are heavyweights like Warren Buffett, Larry Ellison and Bernard Arnault.

Manage your risk

While billionaires love high returns, they’re pros at managing risk, and you can do the same by building an emergency fund. Having liquid cash in your account ensures you’re not forced to sell investments during a market slump. A simple buffer can keep you secure while you wait for the market to bounce back.

Invest in alternative assets

Many high-net-worth individuals invest in alternative assets such as commodities and fine art to round out their portfolios. Commodities like gold and silver can be hedges against inflation and market volatility. And while not highly liquid, collectibles, artwork or vintage cars can offer diversification and the potential for substantial returns.

You might consider investing directly in precious metals through a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.

Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, thereby combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

Navigating sudden stops: How credit support policies can replace shrinking capital flows,"Sudden stops in international capital flows – episodes where foreign financing rapidly withdraws – have long been a challenge for policymakers, especially in emerging markets. These events often trigger financial crises, deepening the economic downturn and amplifying volatility. Since Guillermo Calvo's seminal 1998 work on this topic, which examined sudden stops in emerging markets during the 1990s, much research has focused on understanding how these phenomena disrupt access to external credit, leading to financial crises. Increased availability of microdata has enabled scholars to delve deeper into how these shocks unfold at the firm level (Ates and Saffie 2021, Dassatti et al. 2024). Yet it remains an open question whether government interventions can effectively mitigate the economic fallout of sudden stops and, if so, how these interventions should be designed. In this column, we discuss on going recent work, which examines these questions in the context of Chile’s experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a rich dataset on Chilean firms and the credit support policies that were deployed during the pandemic, our research identifies how government actions helped alleviate the impact of the sudden stop of capital flows to firms and the mechanisms behind these effects.

The sudden stop amid COVID in Chile and the policy response

In March 2020, as the global economy grappled with the start of the pandemic, there was a dramatic contraction in capital flows to Chile, as shown in Figure 1. This contraction was not unique to Chile but reflected a broader global pattern of capital flow reversals in emerging markets. Chile’s experience mirrors what occurred in many emerging economies: a sudden, sharp withdrawal of foreign capital, which amounted to a 4-standard deviation shock for the Chilean case.

Figure 1 The sudden stop-COVID shock in Chile: EPFR-Bonds and CEMBI spread

Note: The figure depicts the fund flows’ EPFR measure and the CEMBI spread for Chile (right axis). The vertical line denotes February 2020, the month before the first COVID case in Chile in March 7, 2020. The data sources are, respectively, Informa PLC and Bloomberg.

To understand how this external shock affected firms within Chile, Figure 2 presents a striking increase in the firm-level uncovered interest parity (UIP) premia. These premia are a measure of the additional cost that firms face when borrowing in local currency relative to borrowing in foreign currencies. During the early months of the pandemic, we observe a near doubling of the UIP premia – indicating that firms’ cost of borrowing in pesos soared. This jump in UIP premia was a key transmission mechanism of the shock, as firms saw their borrowing costs increase sharply in local markets.

Figure 2 The sudden stop-COVID shock in Chile: Mean firm-level UIP deviation

Note: Details of how the UIP premia are calculated can be seen in Acosta-Henao et al. (2024)

In response to this rapid capital flow reversal, the Chilean government introduced two key policies aimed at easing financing constraints for firms: a new central bank credit line facility for commercial banks and government-backed guarantees on bank loans to firms. The noticeable reduction in the UIP premia in May 2020 (second vertical line in Figure 2) coincides with the month when the policies were deployed, after which the UIP premia began to decrease, suggesting that the policy interventions were effective in reducing borrowing costs for firms.

Our research delves deeper into the effectiveness of these policies. Specifically, we investigate how the government’s credit line facility and sovereign guarantees helped firms weather the shock by allowing them to shift their borrowing from costly external sources to more affordable domestic credit.

Firms’ foreign for domestic debt substitution

The central question of our research is whether government-backed credit guarantees and central bank credit lines can substitute for missing external financing during a sudden stop. Our analysis of the Chilean case during the pandemic shock provides strong evidence that these interventions were effective in mitigating the impact of the shock.

An important feature of the Chilean interventions was their size-dependent nature. The central bank’s credit lines were available to commercial banks only if they increased lending to firms below a certain size threshold. Similarly, the government-backed loan guarantees were only available to firms that met specific size requirements, based on their historical sales. This targeting of policies based on firm size allowed us to study the effects of these interventions on different types of firms to better understand their impact.

Figure 3 presents more descriptive evidence by documenting firms’ debt composition before and after the introduction of these policies according to their size. The left panel of the figure shows the share of domestic and external debt in firms’ total debt stocks in April 2020, just before the policies were enacted. The data revealed that relatively smaller firms were more reliant on domestic debt, with 75% of small firms’ total debt consisting of domestic borrowing. In contrast, mega firms, defined as those with annual sales above $35 million (given the prevailing exchange rate at the time), had a much smaller share of domestic debt – only 40%. This pattern of debt composition is consistent with previous studies that have found smaller firms tend to rely more on domestic sources of financing while larger ones tap more international capital markets (Gopinath et al. 2017).

The right panel of Figure 3 shows the flow of new debt between April and July 2020, when credit support policies were deployed. As can be seen, firms shifted their new debt issuance heavily toward domestic debt. Importantly, this shift was concentrated among small/medium and large firms, which were eligible for the government guarantees. These firms increased their reliance on domestic debt issuance, which accounted for 99% and 95%, respectively, of the new debt issued in this period. In contrast, the flow of debt from domestic sources among mega firms – those ineligibles for government guarantees – remained unchanged at 40% of the new debt issued. This stark contrast provides preliminary evidence that the government guarantees helped relatively smaller firms substitute external debt with more affordable domestic debt.

Figure 3 Stock and change in firms’ finance mix, April to July 2020

Notes: The left panel depicts the domestic (blue) and external (red) debt share over total debt for three groups of firms in April 2020: 1) Small and medium (yearly sales of less than 100,000 UF); 2) Large (yearly sales greater than 100,000 UF and less than 1,000,000 UF); 3) Mega (yearly sales greater or equal to 1,000,000 UF). The right panel shows the change of each type of debt, domestic and foreign, as a share of the total change in the debt stock between May and July 2020. All calculations convert all debt to dollars using the spot exchange rate.

To formally assess the causal impact of these policies, we use regression discontinuity design (RDD) methods, which leverage the firm-size threshold for eligibility to government guarantees. The threshold created a quasi-natural experiment, where firms just below the eligibility cutoff were treated with the policy, while those just above the cutoff were not. Figure 4 presents the results of this RDD analysis, showing a 9.4 percentage point increase in the share of domestic debt for eligible firms compared to ineligible firms. This provides evidence that government guarantees caused firms to substitute external debt with domestic debt, helping alleviate some of the negative effects of the capital flow shock.

Figure 4 Increase in domestic debt share for eligible firms

Notes: The red dots depict local polynomial approximations around the cutoff (vertical line). The specification shown in the figure is a degree-0 polynomial with a Triangular Kernel.

The role of credit risk pricing

A second key finding of our research is that the reduction in the UIP premium for eligible firms was primarily driven by a decline in the domestic interest rate on local currency debt. Our loan-level regression analysis reveals that, before the pandemic, firms in Chile faced a domestic UIP premium of about 4%, broadly in line with that found in other emerging markets (Kalemli-Ozan and Varela 2021, di Giovanni et al. (2022), and Gutierrez et al. 2023). As documented in Figure 2, during the early months of the pandemic, the average UIP premium doubled. Our results indicate that it disappeared for firms eligible for government guarantees. Crucially, this reduction in the UIP premium was not observed for ineligible firms, who continued to face higher borrowing costs abroad.

We also find that the reduction in the UIP premium for eligible firms was driven by a reduction in domestic interest rates on loans in local currency, rather than changes in foreign interest rates or the exchange rate. This suggests that the government guarantees played a key role in lowering borrowing costs for eligible firms by reducing perceived credit risk.

Complementarity of policies

Our third key finding is that government guarantees and central bank credit lines complemented each other to boost the supply of domestic credit while simultaneously reducing borrowing costs. We use a small open economy model with heterogeneous firms to explore how these policies interacted. In the model, firms can borrow both domestically and abroad and face market-specific collateral constraints that limit their ability to borrow. The supply of domestic credit comes from financial intermediaries, who lend based on their risk preferences and access to central bank funding.

The model allows us to simulate counterfactual scenarios to assess the effectiveness of each policy in isolation. We find that while government guarantees alone would have helped firms access more domestic credit, they would have counterfactually raised domestic interest rates due to increased credit demand. Similarly, the central bank credit line facility alone would not have fully offset the shock, as banks would have remained reluctant to lend in the more uncertain environment. However, when both policies are deployed jointly the domestic credit market recovers fully, with increased lending at lower interest rates, consistent with the Chilean experience. This underscores how the two policies complemented each other.

Policy implications

The Chilean experience offers valuable insights for other emerging markets facing sudden stops in capital flows. Under conditions of substantial financial stress, policymakers may want to consider government-backed guarantees and central bank interventions as part of their toolkit for mitigating the economic impacts of external financial shocks. However, these interventions must be carefully designed to target the firms that are most vulnerable to credit disruptions as well as limit moral hazard, which has been shown to increase during financial crises (Acharya et al. 2012). Additionally, while such interventions can provide short-term relief, longer-term strategies should focus on strengthening domestic financial markets and enhancing their ability to provide instruments to better manage risks from external debt issuance.

Our research also underscores the importance of building fiscal buffers to ensure the credibility of sovereign guarantees during times of crisis. The success of Chile's policies was partly due to its strong fiscal position, which made the government guarantees credible in the eyes of markets. For other emerging markets, having strong fiscal and financial institutions that foster fiscal resilience and a strong regulatory framework is essential to ensure that similar interventions can be successfully deployed when needed.

The floods and droughts devastating Australia are fingerprints of a warming planet,"As New South Wales once again faces heavy rainfall and flooding, the Victorian towns of Euroa and Violet Town will enter stage 2 water restrictions next Wednesday. How is the climate crisis affecting these contrasting extremes?

The weather pattern bringing heavy rainfall to NSW is a common wet-weather scenario for the coast. A high-pressure system in the Tasman Sea has stalled, and the anticlockwise air flow around the high is pushing moist air from the ocean over land. At the same time, about three kilometres above the surface, a low-pressure system is lifting the moist ocean air up. As moist air rises, it forms clouds, storms, and finally rain.

While this weather pattern itself isn’t unusual, the duration of the weather pattern is. Typically, high pressure in the Tasman may hang around for one to two days. But the current high has been there for the past four days, bringing unrelenting rainfall to NSW. The rain is falling on already sodden ground, increasing the likelihood of flooding.

This is reminiscent of what we saw during the March 2021 floods. Unfortunately, the forecast for the next few days is also reminiscent of March 2021. After the rain from the east finally moves away, another strong band of rain is forecast to cross NSW from the west on Monday.

Scientists are actively researching how climate change is shaping Australia’s weather systems. We are not sure if weather systems will stall more often or not, mostly because we don’t yet have the computing power to run high-definition climate models needed to study them.

However, climate modelling capability is growing every year. Just last week, Australian climate scientists took part in a global hackathon to analyse data produced by models with about 50 times higher resolution than a typical one. Earlier studies using lower definition models suggest we may see a decrease in stalled high pressure in the Tasman Sea, and low-pressure systems may also occur less often but produce more intense rainfall when they do happen.

While future high- and low-pressure systems are uncertain, atmospheric moisture is likely to increase in a warmer world.

After the March 2021 floods, my colleagues and I assessed how often Sydney may experience persistently high amounts of atmospheric moisture over the region. High atmospheric moisture is a key ingredient in heavy rainfall, and when it sticks around for a while, persistent rainfall and flooding become more likely.

We found that by 2080-2100, the chance of these high moisture events may increase by about 80% under both moderate and high emissions scenarios. With more moisture in the atmosphere, when low-pressure systems do occur and help convert the moisture into rain, the rain will probably be more intense due to global heating.

As NSW sandbags, Adelaide is ramping up its desalination plant to ensure the city’s water supply. Parts of South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia have received very much below the average rainfall over summer and autumn. Drought in Australia is largely driven by a lack of heavy rainfall events. Only one to five days of heavy rainfall per year can be the difference between whether there is a drought or not.

The climate patterns in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, which influence year-to-year rainfall variability in Australia, have been in neutral or dry phases. Neither El Niño nor La Niña have appeared since autumn 2024. La Niña tried to rear its head over summer but didn’t quite develop.

The visually spectacular northwest cloudband, which can bring a band of rainfall from Broome to Hobart, has been absent this year. Instead, slow-moving high-pressure systems have brought frustratingly settled weather to southern Australia.

Like flooding, the change in drought occurrence with a warming planet is still a leading topic of research in Australia. Since droughts are rare events, identifying trends in the data is much harder than identifying trends in maximum temperature, for example, which happens every day.

The “tinderbox drought” of 2017-2019 was the first drought in Australia where the severity would not have been possible without global heating. Additionally, southwest Australia has seen a robust rainfall decline since the 1970s, which is expected to continue.

Droughts and floods have marked the Australian psyche for generations. But the fingerprints of a warming planet are starting to appear as increasing rainfall intensity and drought severity. It is undoubtedly clear that continuing to burn or export fossil fuels will increase the risk of extreme weather devastating Australia.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/25/australia-floods-droughts-climate-change-global-warming,World

LONDON -- Russian drones and missiles again bombarded cities across Ukraine on Saturday night into Sunday morning despite the completion of the largest prisoner exchange of the 3-year-old war.

The Armed Forces Operational Command in Poland -- a NATO nation that borders Ukraine to the west -- said in a Sunday morning post to X that its fighter jets were scrambled during the Russian attack. ""Intensive activity of long-range aviation of the Russian Federation has been observed, associated with strikes carried out on objects located, among others, in the western territory of Ukraine,"" the statement said.

Ukraine's air force said in a post to Telegram that Russia launched a total of 367 ""air attack vehicles"" -- among them nine Iskander ballistic missiles, 56 cruise missiles, four guided air missiles and 298 attack drones -- at targets across the country.

The air force said 45 cruise missiles and 266 drones were shot down or otherwise neutralized during the attack.

""Most regions of Ukraine were affected by the enemy attack,"" the air force wrote, with strikes reported in 22 locations and downed cruise missiles or strike drones reported in 15 locations.

Ukraine's Interior Ministry said in a statement that at least 18 people were killed -- among them three children from the same family -- and 85 people injured. More than 80 residential buildings were damaged and 27 fires recorded, it added.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media early Sunday, ""Today, rescuers have been working in more than 30 Ukrainian cities and villages following Russia’s massive strike.""

""These were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities,"" Zelenskyy continued. ""Ordinary residential buildings were destroyed and damaged. In Kyiv, dormitories of the university's history department were hit. There were also strikes on enterprises. Tragically, people were killed, including children.""

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the attacks constituted ""a massive strike by sea, air, land-based precision weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles against enterprises of Ukraine's military-industrial complex that produce missile weapon components, radio electronics, explosives, rocket fuel and strike drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as radio-technical reconnaissance and satellite communications centers.""

""The targets of the strike have been achieved,"" the ministry said in a post to Telegram. ""All designated targets have been hit.""

The latest attack marks the fourth consecutive night during which Russia launched more than 100 missiles and drones into Ukraine, per Ukrainian air force figures. Though long-range attacks have occurred almost nightly in recent months, Russia's recent bombardments have been notable for their scale.

Ukraine is also continuing its own drone strikes into Russia, with the Defense Ministry in Moscow reporting the downing of 110 Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday.

The barrages came despite the beginning of a multi-day prisoner exchange process on Friday. Some 1,000 troops from both sides were expected to be swapped, with the process complete as of Sunday morning, according to Zelenskyy.

The prisoner exchange was the largest since Moscow's invasion began in February 2022. Russia and Ukraine have swapped prisoners of war throughout the conflict, despite their failure to agree a lasting ceasefire.

U.S.-brokered peace talks since President Donald Trump's return to office in January have likewise failed to reach an accord, with both Kyiv and Moscow accusing each other of undermining negotiations.

Ukraine is demanding a full 30-day ceasefire, during which time peace talks can take place. Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out ceding territory to Moscow in any peace deal.

Trump's threats of new sanctions on Russia -- as yet unrealized despite Ukrainian and European appeals for more American pressure on President Vladimir Putin -- do not appear to have pushed the Kremlin away from its maximalist war goals, which essentially equate to Ukrainian capitulation.

Those demands include the annexation of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions -- plus the retention of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014 -- Kyiv's demilitarization, a permanent block on Ukrainian accession to NATO and the ""denazification"" of the country -- a nebulous demand based on Russia's false representation of the Ukrainian government as a far-right dictatorship.

Ukrainian leaders have cited Russia's continued massed strikes as evidence that Moscow is not genuine in its appeals for peace.

""Each such terrorist Russian strike is a sufficient reason for new sanctions against Russia,"" Zelenskyy said on Sunday. ""Russia is dragging out this war and continues to kill every day. The world may go on a weekend break, but the war continues, regardless of weekends and weekdays. This cannot be ignored. Silence of America, silence of others around the world only encourage Putin.""

""Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,"" he added. ""Sanctions will certainly help. Determination matters now -- the determination of the United States, of European countries, and of all those around the world who seek peace. The world knows all the weaknesses of the Russian economy.""

""The war can be stopped, but only through the necessary force of pressure on Russia,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Putin must be forced to think not about launching missiles, but about ending the war.""

Andriy Yermak -- the head of Zelenskyy's office -- wrote on Telegram early Sunday, ""Instead of a ceasefire, there are murders.""

""Without pressure, nothing will change and Russia and its allies will only build up forces for such murders in Western countries,"" Yermak continued. ""Moscow will fight as long as it has the ability to produce weapons.""",https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-hits-ukraine-massive-drone-missile-barrage-amid/story?id=122173886,World
Tributes paid to former Vietnamese president,"ISLAMABAD : Pakistan-Asean Friendship Association paid homage to the former Vietnamese president Tran Duc Luong who passed away recently.

A delegation of the Pakistan-Asean Friendship Association, led by its chairman Zafar Bakhtawari visited the Vietnamese embassy and offered condolences to Vietnamese Ambassador Pham Anh Tuan on the passing of the former president.

Accompanied by the association members Asim Abbasi and Malik Mohsin Khalid, Mr Bakhtawari signed the condolence book, and wrote that former president Tran Duc Luong was a great political leader who led Vietnam forward with national unity and solidarity.

Under his leadership, Vietnam achieved not only internal stability but also gained a prominent position on the global stage.

Late president Luong introduced economic reforms that have turned Vietnam into a key economic power in the eastern world today.

“Mr Luong promoted Vietnam’s positive role not only in the Asean region but also at the international level. Under his leadership, Vietnam embraced the principles of peace, development and prosperity, which became the solid foundation of the country,” Mr Bakhtawari said.

UK’s ruling Labour under internal pressure to recognize Palestine,"Israeli soldiers and former detainees detail widespread use of human shields in Gaza

TEL AVIV: The only times the Palestinian man wasn’t bound or blindfolded, he said, was when he was used by Israeli soldiers as their human shield.

Dressed in army fatigues with a camera fixed to his forehead, Ayman Abu Hamadan was forced into houses in the Gaza Strip to make sure they were clear of bombs and gunmen, he said. When one unit finished with him, he was passed to the next.

“They beat me and told me: ‘You have no other option; do this or we’ll kill you,’” the 36-year-old told The Associated Press, describing the 2-1/2 weeks he was held last summer by the Israeli military in northern Gaza.

Orders often came from the top, and at times nearly every platoon used a Palestinian to clear locations, said an Israeli officer, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

Several Palestinians and soldiers told the AP that Israeli troops are systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields in Gaza, sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for explosives or militants. The dangerous practice has become ubiquitous during 19 months of war, they said.

In response to these allegations, Israel’s military says it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields — a practice it has long accused Hamas of using in Gaza. Israeli officials blame the militants for the civilian death toll in its offensive that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.

In a statement to the AP, the military said it also bans otherwise coercing civilians to participate in operations, and “all such orders are routinely emphasized to the forces.”

The military said it’s investigating several cases alleging that Palestinians were involved in missions, but wouldn’t provide details. It didn’t answer questions about the reach of the practice or any orders from commanding officers.

The AP spoke with seven Palestinians who described being used as shields in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and with two members of Israel’s military who said they engaged in the practice, which is prohibited by international law. Rights groups are ringing the alarm, saying it’s become standard procedure increasingly used in the war.

“These are not isolated accounts; they point to a systemic failure and a horrifying moral collapse,” said Nadav Weiman, executive director of Breaking the Silence — a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers that has collected testimonies about the practice from within the military. “Israel rightly condemns Hamas for using civilians as human shields, but our own soldiers describe doing the very same.”

Abu Hamadan said he was detained in August after being separated from his family, and soldiers told him he’d help with a “special mission.” He was forced, for 17 days, to search houses and inspect every hole in the ground for tunnels, he said.

Soldiers stood behind him and, once it was clear, entered the buildings to damage or destroy them, he said. He spent each night bound in a dark room, only to wake up and do it again.

The use of human shields ‘caught on like fire’

Rights groups say Israel has used Palestinians as shields in Gaza and the West Bank for decades. The Supreme Court outlawed the practice in 2005. But the groups continued to document violations.

Still, experts say this war is the first time in decades the practice — and the debate around it — has been so widespread.

The two Israeli soldiers who spoke to the AP — and a third who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence — said commanders were aware of the use of human shields and tolerated it, with some giving orders to do so. Some said it was referred to as the “mosquito protocol” and that Palestinians were also referred to as “wasps” and other dehumanizing terms.

The soldiers — who said they’re no longer serving in Gaza — said the practice sped up operations, saved ammunition, and spared combat dogs from injury or death.

The soldiers said they first became aware human shields were being used shortly after the war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, and that it became widespread by the middle of 2024. Orders to “bring a mosquito” often came via radio, they said — shorthand everyone understood. Soldiers acted on commanding officers’ orders, according to the officer who spoke to the AP.

He said that by the end of his nine months in Gaza, every infantry unit used a Palestinian to clear houses before entering.

“Once this idea was initiated, it caught on like fire in a field,” the 26-year-old said. “People saw how effective and easy it was.”

He described a 2024 planning meeting where a brigade commander presented to the division commander a slide reading “get a mosquito” and a suggestion they might “just catch one off the streets.”

The officer wrote two incident reports to the brigade commander detailing the use of human shields, reports that would have been escalated to the division chief, he said. The military said it had no comment when asked whether it received them.

One report documented the accidental killing of a Palestinian, he said — troops didn’t realize another unit was using him as a shield and shot him as he ran into a house. The officer recommended the Palestinians be dressed in army clothes to avoid misidentification.

He said he knew of at least one other Palestinian who died while used as a shield — he passed out in a tunnel.

Troops unsuccessfully pushed back, a sergeant says

Convincing soldiers to operate lawfully when they see their enemy using questionable practices is difficult, said Michael Schmitt, a distinguished professor of international law at the US Military Academy at West Point. Israeli officials and other observers say Hamas uses civilians as shields as it embeds itself in communities, hiding fighters in hospitals and schools.

“It’s really a heavy lift to look at your own soldiers and say you have to comply,” Schmitt said.

One soldier told the AP his unit tried to refuse to use human shields in mid-2024 but were told they had no choice, with a high-ranking officer saying they shouldn’t worry about international humanitarian law.

The sergeant — speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal — said the troops used a 16-year-old and a 30-year-old for a few days.

The boy shook constantly, he said, and both repeated “Rafah, Rafah” — Gaza’s southernmost city, where more than 1 million Palestinians had fled from fighting elsewhere at that point in the war.

It seemed they were begging to be freed, the sergeant said.

‘I have children,’ one man says he pleaded

Masoud Abu Saeed said he was used as a shield for two weeks in March 2024 in the southern city of Khan Younis.

“This is extremely dangerous,” he recounted telling a soldier. “I have children and want to reunite with them.”

The 36-year-old said he was forced into houses, buildings and a hospital to dig up suspected tunnels and clear areas. He said he wore a first-responder vest for easy identification, carrying a phone, hammer and chain cutters.

During one operation, he bumped into his brother, used as a shield by another unit, he said.

They hugged. “I thought Israel’s army had executed him,” he said.

Palestinians also report being used as shields in the West Bank.

Hazar Estity said soldiers took her Jenin refugee camp home in November, forcing her to film inside several apartments and clear them before troops entered.

She said she pleaded to return to her 21-month-old son, but soldiers didn’t listen.

“I was most afraid that they would kill me,” she said. “And that I wouldn’t see my son again.”",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2601965/middle-east,World
"Pakistan ranks seventh in civilian deaths, injuries from explosives in 2024","Police officers and people gather at the site amid the debris after a bomb blast at a railway station in Quetta, Pakistan November 9, 2024. — Reuters

Pakistan ranked seventh globally for civilian casualties from explosive weapons in 2024, according to a new report by the British explosive violence monitor Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), which recorded the highest global toll from such violence since 2010.

AOAV reported a total of 67,026 deaths and injuries from explosive weapons worldwide last year. Of these, 59,524 were civilians, making up 89% of all casualties. Civilian deaths alone totalled 24,147.

The report described 2024 as “the most injurious year for civilians” since the Explosive Violence Monitoring Project began. Compared to 2023, global incidents increased by 29%, civilian casualties by 69%, and civilian deaths by 50%.

In Pakistan, AOAV recorded 790 civilian casualties, including 210 killed, across 248 incidents — a 14% rise in incidents from 218 the previous year. Civilian casualties fell by 9% from 870 in 2023, while fatalities dropped by 16% from 249. Armed actor casualties totalled 686, down 24% from 899.

The AOAV noted that “2024 saw the highest number of recorded incidents in Pakistan since 2014”, and the second highest number of civilian casualties since 2018.

Non-state actors were responsible for 76% (603) of Pakistan’s civilian casualties. Among them, unknown non-state actors accounted for 54% (423), a decline from 541 in 2023. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) was linked to 119 civilian casualties — up 440% from 22 the year prior — and made up 15% of the total.

Meanwhile, Daesh Khorasan was responsible for 45 casualties, down from 194. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) caused 10, down from 32.

IEDs and suicide bombings

Pakistan recorded the second highest civilian toll globally from IED attacks, with 485 casualties (139 killed) across 132 incidents. This marked a 30% decrease in civilian casualties, but an 8% rise in the number of IED-related incidents.

Suicide bombings accounted for 103 civilian casualties (21 killed) across 9 incidents, a 67% decline from 27 incidents in 2023 — the lowest number since 2021. All suicide attacks were carried out by non-state actors. The BLA was responsible for 2 of the 9 suicide bombings, but accounted for 89% (92) of resulting civilian harm. On average, suicide attacks in Pakistan harmed 11.4 civilians per attack and killed 2.3.

The AOAV also noted a sharp rise in casualties from ground-launched weapons, which caused 217 civilian casualties — 27% of the total — representing a 54% increase from 2023.

Pakistan continues to experience high levels of explosive violence compared to recent years. The latest incident came last week when a powerful explosion by India-backed militants targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Balochistan's Khuzdar. At least six, including four students were martyred and dozens of others injured.

The south-western province along with the neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain the most-affected by terrorism.

‘The world does not care if we all die’: hunger and despair in the ruins of Gaza City,"On the streets of Gaza City this week, there were two sounds that never ceased, day or night. In the west, the Mediterranean breakers crashed on the rubbish-strewn shoreline. In the east, the shells, missiles and rockets exploded with dull thuds and occasional ear-splitting cracks.

At least 100,000 people have come to Gaza City, once the bustling commercial and cultural hub of the Palestinian territory. All are fleeing the new offensive – dubbed Gideon’s Chariots – recently launched by Israel into the ruined towns and neighbourhoods of northern Gaza.

The blasts that the newly displaced can hear, as they crowd into makeshift shelters and hastily constructed encampments, or simply set up their tents or tarpaulins on the pock-marked pavements, sometimes come during direct clashes between Israeli troops and Hamas, though the militant Islamist organisation remains elusive, often underground.

Much more often, they are the sounds of airstrikes and artillery bombardment which have killed about 750 people and injured 2,000 more across Gaza in the last week, mostly women and children, according to medical officials there.

On Wednesday, Mohammed Abu Nadi moved his family from Jabaliya, a neighbourhood east of Gaza City that has been reduced to ruins in multiple Israeli offensives and raids.

“What happened this week was another escalation … There were relentless bombings everywhere,” the 33-year-old said. “My friend was on his way to get a vehicle to move his family to Gaza City, but when he returned, he found his home reduced to rubble. His wife and children were all killed.

“They were just young children, innocent civilians with no involvement in anything. I was shocked when it happened. I quickly carried my wife and family and left the area heading towards Gaza City.”

Abu Adam Abdul Rabbo, 55, said more than 80 members of his extended family had been killed during the 19-month conflict, which was triggered by a Hamas attack into Israel in which militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducted 251, of whom 57 remain in Gaza. The ensuing Israeli offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, and reduced much of the territory to rubble; smashing roads, health facilities, schools, religious sites, sanitation systems and much else. Israeli officials say they only attack military targets and accuse Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge it denies.

A week ago, Rabbo said he was woken by the sound of a huge blast that had targeted his brother’s house, killing five.

“We struggled to transfer their bodies to hospital as a quadcopter drone was firing bullets everywhere. We managed to bury them in the Jabaliya town cemetery. After that, we decided to leave, fearing for the lives of our remaining children.

“We were able to carry only a few basic items – some clothes and food. My wife was crying bitterly, asking: ‘How will we survive? What can we take with us? How long will we remain displaced?,’” Rabbo said.

This month, food security experts backed by the United Nations said the territory was at critical risk of famine, with cases of malnutrition rising rapidly.

UN warehouses in the territory are empty and most of the free bakeries that many relied on for their daily bread shut down weeks ago – though aid agencies have been able to keep some community kitchens running to produce about 300,000 meals a day. The limited food available to buy is too expensive for almost everybody, with 1kg of tomatoes or onions costing the equivalent of $13.

“Every corner of every street is crowded with people,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Gaza NGOs Network who is based in Gaza City. “They are living in rubbish dumps, cesspits. There are flies, mosquitoes. We have no water to deliver, no food, no tents or blankets or tarpaulins, nothing. People are very, very hungry but there is nothing to give them.”

UN officials said on Friday that their clinics and pharmacies were no longer able to offer 40% of the treatments categorised as essential by the World Health Organization. Medics interviewed last week reported seeing many abscesses and skin diseases among patients, as well as acute cases of diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses – in addition to the many injuries from airstrikes.

“We see some children with malnutrition, but everyone complains of being hungry,” said Dr Iain Lennon, a British emergency medicine consultant in Mawasi, southern Gaza. “We often see patients who are tired or dizzy because they just have not eaten enough.”

In recent days, Israel has eased the tight blockade into Gaza imposed in early March, when the first phase of a fragile ceasefire expired. On Friday, 100 trucks entered the territory, but very little aid had been distributed.

Humanitarian officials said a key problem was security. Law and order improved in the territory during the ceasefire from mid-January to March when Hamas-run police were on the streets, but it has collapsed since. Of a convoy of 20 trucks each carrying 20 tonnes of wheat flour for the World Food Programme, only three arrived at their destination on Thursday night after two broke down and 15 were hijacked by looters and driven away.

“You don’t see lines of children with rib cages and spines showing like in Africa,” said one UN official, “but there you have no roads and a population scattered over an area the size of Europe. Here, there is 130,000 tonnes of aid just the other side of the entry points into Gaza, a few kilometres away.”

Few have confidence that a US-backed Israeli scheme to bring in aid due to start next week will improve the situation. The plan involves a small number of distribution hubs in southern of Gaza being run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops who will vet recipients. UN aid workers describe the scheme as dangerous, impractical and possibly unlawful.

To get aid, Palestinians will have to travel up to 25 miles (40km) across rubble-strewn roads during an active conflict, despite an almost total lack of available transport, to retrieve a monthly 20kg food parcel.

“It would be very difficult to go there, and there is no guarantee that you can come back,” Shawa said. “This is an engineered strategy to displace people and start clearing the north of Gaza.”

Israel said the plan was necessary to prevent Hamas seizing and selling aid to fund its operations. Aid officials in Gaza said on Friday there was no evidence of any widespread diversion of aid at any stage of the conflict.

Meanwhile, the vulnerable suffer the most. Six weeks ago the eldest son of Ihab al-Attar, from Beit Lahia, tried to return to the family home to retrieve food and clothes, but he was targeted by a missile and badly injured. There was no warning and no evacuation orders from the Israeli military, Attar, 41, said.

A series of operations saved 21-year-old Mahmoud’s life but left him without much of his intestines and an infected wound. When the new Israeli offensive began 10 days ago, the family were forced to more from their battered but habitable home to a tent on a street in Gaza City. With almost all hospitals in northern Gaza no longer functioning and the remaining few overwhelmed, the family were trying to care for Mahmoud themselves.

“Now Mahmoud’s condition worsens day by day,” Attar said. “The hardest part is watching my son dying before my eyes and being unable to do anything for him. I fear I will lose my son.”

Also in great danger is Yazan, Nadi’s eight-year-old quadraplegic son who, his father said, needed a special diet and care.

“He has become extremely thin and is suffering from severe malnutrition. I took him to the hospital several times, but the doctors told me they can’t do anything for him.”

Few hold out much hope for any relief soon. Negotiations for a new ceasefire have stalled, and aid is likely to take days, even weeks to arrive, in northern Gaza, if at all.

Umm Ammar Jundiyea, 65, who is in Gaza City after fleeing the eastern neighbourhood of Shujaiya, described a “bleak” future.

“The world does not care about what is happening in Gaza, even if we all die,” the mother of eight said. “This world is deceitful and hypocritical. It claims to be civilised and humane, but it only sees with one eye.”",https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/may/25/gaza-city-israeli-offensive-despair-hunger,World
U.S. drone strikes kill at least 6 in suspected al-Qaeda hideout in Yemen: sources,"ADEN, Yemen, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. drone strikes overnight targeted a suspected al-Qaeda hideout in Yemen's southern province of Abyan, killing at least six people, a Yemeni military official told Xinhua on Saturday.

The strikes hit the mountainous Marakisha area in eastern Abyan late Friday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. All those killed were believed to be members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the Yemen-based branch of the militant network.

The operation was carried out in coordination with Yemeni government forces, the official added.

The targeted site had reportedly served as a launch point for attacks against government forces and recent bombing operations in the province, according to the source.

However, conflicting accounts have emerged. A local tribal leader confirmed two overnight drone strikes but claimed they targeted tribal elements not affiliated with the AQAP.

There has been no official statement from the AQAP regarding the incident.

Abyan has been a key battleground in Yemen's counter-terrorism efforts since late 2022. Forces from the pro-government Southern Transitional Council, backed by government troops, have sought to root out AQAP fighters entrenched in remote areas.

Government officials say the group continues to operate active cells in the region, often targeting security personnel with improvised explosive devices.

Yemen's long-running civil war, which began in 2014 when Houthi group seized the capital Sanaa, has allowed extremist groups like the AQAP to exploit the power vacuum. The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine, according to United Nations estimates. ■",https://english.news.cn/20250524/3d2571cfd7564d10886e92ba213451f0/c.html,World
UN chief slams ‘cruelest phase’ of Gaza conflict,"UNITED NATIONS: Uni­t­ed Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Friday said “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring what may be the cruelest phase of this cruel conflict” as Israel ramps up its military offensive.

“For nearly 80 days, Israel blocked the entry of life-saving international aid,” he said in a statement. “The entire population of Gaza is facing the risk of famine.

“The Israeli military offensive is intensifying with atrocious levels of death and destruction.

“Today, 80 per cent of Gaza has been either designated an Israeli-militarised zone or an area where people have been ordered to leave.”

More than 50 Palestinians dead or missing in Israeli strike on Jabalia

Aid also began trickling into the Gaza Strip on Monday for the first time in more than two months, amid condemnation of the Israeli blockade that sparked severe shortages of food and medicine.

“Israel has clear obligations under international humanitarian law,” Guterres said. “As the occupying power, it must agree to allow and facilitate the aid that is needed,” he said.

More than 50 Palestinians were killed or went missing after an Israeli air strike on a residential building in the Jabalia al-Balad area of northern Gaza, Palestinian Civil Defence sources say.

Israeli drones targeted more than five locations near the entrance to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza on Friday morning, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.

When people rushed to help the victims, Israeli forces attacked them again, injuring several more Palestinians.

Separately, three people, including a young girl, lost their lives in an Israeli airstrike on an apartment near Abdel Aal junction on al-Jalaa Street in Gaza City.

Two siblings were killed, and their father suffered critical injuries when an Israeli strike hit a home in the western camp area of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.

In eastern Khan Yunis, several casualties are reported after Israeli forces struck a home in the town of Abasan al-Kabira.

Israeli air strikes also killed at least six Palestinians guarding aid trucks against looters, Hamas officials said, underlining the problems hindering supplies from reaching hungry people in Gaza following Israel’s 11-week-long blockade.

The Israeli military claimed 107 trucks carrying flour and other foodstuffs as well as medical supplies, entered the Gaza Strip from the Kerem Shalom crossing point on Thursday. But getting the supplies to people sheltering in tents and other makeshift accommodations has been fitful.

So far, an umbrella network of Palestinian aid groups said, 119 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Israel eased its blockade on Monday in the face of an international outcry.

But distribution has been hampered by looting by groups of men, some of them armed, near the city of Khan Yunis, the network said.

A Hamas official said six members of a security team tasked with guarding the shipments were killed. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

The aid groups network also said the amount of aid coming into Gaza was still inadequate and only included a narrow range of supplies. It said Israel’s agreement to allow trucks to enter the war-shattered enclave was a “deceptive manoeuvre” to avoid international pressure calling for the lifting of the blockade.

Syria welcomes U.S. decision to ease Assad-era sanctions as 'positive step',"Syria considers the move by the Trump administration to ease sanctions imposed on the war-torn country as a “positive step” to ease humanitarian and economic suffering, its Foreign Ministry said.

In a statement, the Ministry said Syria “extends its hand” to anyone that wants to cooperate with Damascus, on the condition that there is no intervention in the country's internal affairs.

The statement came after the Trump administration granted Syria sweeping exemptions from sanctions on Friday (May 23, 2025) in a major first step toward fulfilling the president's pledge to lift a half-century of penalties on a country shattered by 14 years of civil war.

Thomas Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkiye who has also been appointed as special envoy for Syria, met with Syria's president and foreign minister during their visit to Turkiye on Saturday, adding the President Ahmad al-Sharaa welcomed Washington's “fast action on lifting sanctions.” “President Trump's goal is to enable the new government to create the conditions for the Syrian people to not only survive but thrive,” Mr. Barrack said in a statement.

Mr. Barrack said he stressed that the cessation of sanctions against Syria will preserve the integrity “of our primary objective — the enduring defeat of” the Islamic State group, also known as IS or ISIS. He added that it will give Syrians a chance for a better future.

“I also commended President al-Sharaa on taking meaningful steps towards enacting President Trump's points on foreign terrorist fighters, counter-ISIS measures, relations with Israel, and camps and detention centres in Northeast Syria,” Mr. Barrack said.

He was referring to detention centres where thousands of IS members are held and two camps where their families stay in areas currently controlled by the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

A measure by the State Department waived for six months a tough set of sanctions imposed by Congress in 2019. A Treasury Department action suspended enforcement of sanctions against anyone doing business with a range of Syrian individuals and entities, including Syria's central bank.

The congressional sanctions, known as the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, had aimed to isolate Syria's previous rulers by effectively expelling those doing business with them from the global financial system. They specifically block post-war reconstruction, so while they can be waived for 180 days by executive order, investors are likely to be wary of reconstruction projects when sanctions could be reinstated after six months.

The Trump administration said Friday's actions were “just one part of a broader U.S. government effort to remove the full architecture of sanctions.” Those penalties had been imposed on the Assad family for their support of Iranian-backed militias, their chemical weapons program and abuses of civilians.

Mr. Trump said during a visit to the region earlier this month that the US would roll back the heavy financial penalties in a bid to give the interim government a better chance of survival.

Damascus resident Nael Kaddah said now that the sanctions are being eased, the country will flourish again. He said Syrians will be able to transfer money freely, unlike in the past when there were several companies that monopolized the business and took large commissions on transfers.

“Now any citizen can receive a transfer from anywhere in the world,” he said.

Syria's foreign ministry said dialogue and diplomacy are the best way to build “balanced relations that achieve the interest of the people and strengthen security and stability in the region.” It added that the coming period in Syria will be reconstruction and restoring “Syria's natural status” in the region and around the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/syria-welcomes-us-decision-to-ease-assad-era-sanctions-as-positive-step/article69616902.ece,World
"Asaduddin Owaisi calls Pakistan a ‘failed state’ during interaction in Bahrain, says India exercised maximum restraint","All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MP Asaduddin Owaisi, part of the all-party delegation led by BJP MP Baijayant Panda, referred to Pakistan as a ""failed state"" during an interaction with prominent figures in Bahrain.

During the interaction, Mr. Owaisi said, ""Our government has sent us over here...so that the world knows the threat India has been facing since last so many years. Unfortunately, we have lost so many innocent lives. This problem emanates from Pakistan only. Unless and until Pakistan stops promoting, aiding and sponsoring these terrorist groups, this problem won't go away.""

He further added, ""Our government has taken all the steps to protect the lives of every Indian. This govt has made very clear next time you [Pakistan] take up this misadventure, it will be beyond what they are expecting...""

‘India exercised maximum restraint’

Mr. Owaisi noted that India has repeatedly exercised maximum restraint despite grave provocations. Recalling the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed, he emphasised the human cost of terrorism. ""Please reflect on the human tragedy of this massacre. A woman married six days ago became a widow on the seventh day. Another woman, married just two months ago, also lost her husband in this attack,"" he said.

Asserting India's defensive strength, Mr. Owaisi added, ""India has all the wherewithal, and we have every means necessary to ensure the safety of not only Indian citizens, but also every individual residing in India.""

AIMIM leader stated that India's air defence systems had effectively intercepted threats emanating from across the border. ""The government and the media, our air defence system, our technology and warfare capabilities, successfully intercepted and neutralised everything that was launched by a failed state like Pakistan,"" he said.

Mr. Owaisi stressed the need for international cooperation in curbing terror financing and urged the Bahrain Government to support efforts to bring Pakistan back to the FATF grey list, stating that such funds have been used to support terrorist activities.""

“There is unanimity in our country, irrespective of whatever political affiliations we belong to. We have our political differences, but when it comes to the integrity of our country, it is high time our neighbouring country understands...I request and hope that the Bahrain government will help us in bringing Pakistan back to the grey list of FATF because this money has been used to support those terrorists,” Mr. Owaisi said.

The delegation, led by BJP MP Baijayant Panda, also includes Nishikant Dubey MP, BJP; Phangnon Konyak, MP, BJP; Rekha Sharma MP, NJP; AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi; Satnam Singh Sandhu MP; Ghulam Nabi Azad; and Ambassador Harsh Shringla.

The delegation aims to brief international partners on India’s response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and its broader fight against cross-border terrorism while engaging with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Algeria. The multi-party delegation, consisting of seven groups led by one MP each, has been initiated to counter global misinformation and highlight India’s zero-tolerance policy on terrorism.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/asaduddin-owaisi-calls-pakistan-a-failed-state-during-interaction-in-bahrain-says-india-exercised-maximum-restraint/article69616968.ece,World
"Iran-US nuclear talks made some 'but not conclusive progress,' mediator Oman says","ADVERTISEMENT

Iran and the United States made ""some but not conclusive progress"" in the fifth round of negotiations in Rome over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear programme, Oman's mediator has said.

The remarks by Badr al-Busaidi suggested the negotiations between the two sides would continue.

But blocking progress is Washington's demands that Iran completely stop enriching uranium, something Tehran has called a ""red line"" and insists its programme must continue.

""The fifth round of Iran US talks have concluded today in Rome with some but not conclusive progress,"" al-Busaidi wrote on X.

""We hope to clarify the remaining issues in the coming days, to allow us to proceed towards the common goal of reaching a sustainable and honourable agreement.""

This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre in Iran, 2 May, 2025 AP Photo

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Iranian state television after the talks that al-Busaidi presented ideas that will be conveyed to the two nations' capitals ""without creating any commitments for either side.""

""These negotiations are too complex to be resolved in just two or three meetings,"" he said. ""I am hopeful that in the next one or two rounds — especially given the better understanding of the Islamic Republic’s positions — we can reach solutions that allow the talks to progress.""

The US was again represented by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Michael Anton, the State Department’s policy planning director.

They had no immediate comment afterwards, but the Iranian side said Witkoff left early from the negotiations which were held at the Omani Embassy.

Enrichment a key sticking point

The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the US has imposed.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to launch air strikes targeting Iran's nuclear facilities if a deal isn't reached.

Iranian officials meanwhile increasingly warn they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Iranian citizens protest against the current Iranian government outside the Omani Embassy in Rome, 23 May, 2025 AP Photo

""Iran almost certainly is not producing nuclear weapons, but Iran has undertaken activities in recent years that better position it to produce them, if it chooses to do so,"" a new report from the US Defence Intelligence Agency said.

""These actions reduce the time required to produce sufficient weapons-grade uranium for a first nuclear device to probably less than one week.""

However, it likely still would take Iran months to make a working bomb, experts say.

Enrichment remains the key point of contention. Witkoff at one point suggested Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later began saying all Iranian enrichment must stop.

That position on the American side has hardened over time.

Asked about the negotiations, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said ""we believe that we are going to succeed"" in the talks and on Washington's push for no enrichment.

One idea floated so far that might allow Iran to stop enrichment in the Islamic Republic but maintain a supply of uranium could be a consortium in the Middle East backed by regional countries and the US.

There also are multiple countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency offering low-enriched uranium that can be used for peaceful purposes by countries.

However, Iran's Foreign Ministry has maintained enrichment must continue within the country's borders and a similar fuel-swap proposal failed to gain traction in negotiations in 2010.

Meanwhile, Israel has threatened to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities on their own if it feels threatened, further complicating regional tensions already spiked by the war in Gaza.

Araghchi warned earlier this week that Iran would take ""special measures"" to defend its nuclear sites if Israel continued to threaten them, while also warning the US it would view it as complicit in any Israeli attack.

The landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), capped Tehran’s enrichment level at 3.67% and reduced its uranium stockpile to 300 kilograms.

That level is enough for nuclear power plants, but far below weapons-grade levels of 90%.

Since the deal collapsed in 2018 with Trump's unilateral withdrawal of the US from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its programme and enriched uranium to up to 60% purity, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels.",https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/23/iran-us-nuclear-talks-made-some-but-not-conclusive-progress-mediator-oman-says,World
Bangladesh cancels $21m defence deal with India,"THE government of Bangladesh has cancelled a $21 million contract awarded to Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Ltd (GRSE), an Indian public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Defence, for the construction of an advanced ocean-going tug, The Hindu reported.

According to the Indian publication, the cancellation closely follows India’s recent move to withdraw the transhipment facility previously extended to Bangladesh to export its cargo to third countries — a development that analysts interpret as signalling strain in bilateral relations.

In a regulatory disclosure submitted to the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd and BSE Ltd under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Require­ments) Regulations, 2015, GRSE confirmed that the government of Bangladesh had cancelled the order, originally placed in July 2024.

The cancellation adds to a series of geopolitical developments since the change in political leadership in Bangladesh following the fall of prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s government in August 2024. Observers note that ties between the two neighbours have become increasingly tense in recent months.

In a statement, GRSE also announced that it had emerged as the lowest bidder for the construction of Next Generation Corvettes (NGC) for the Indian Navy.

Bangladesh's Yunus seeks unity with fresh political talks,"Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus says he has a duty to implement democratic reforms before elections he has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest

Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who leads the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections are held, has called for rival parties to give him their full support.

The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted by a student-led revolt in August 2024, ending her iron-fisted rule of 15 years.

The talks come after meetings that stretched late into Saturday evening with major political parties, including those who have protested against the government this month.

""Chief adviser professor Muhammad Yunus will meet the leaders of several parties on Sunday,"" his press secretary Shafiqul Alam told AFP.

There are 54 registered political parties in Bangladesh -- not including the now-banned Awami League of fugitive former leader Hasina.

Alam did not specify how many parties were invited to this round of talks.

'Ongoing crisis'

Mamunul Haque, leader of the Islamist Khelafat-e-Majlish party, said he was attending discussions expected to focus on ""the ongoing crisis"".

Zonayed Saki of the liberal Ganosamhati Andolon party said he was also attending.

After a week of escalation during which rival parties protested on the streets of the capital Dhaka, the government led by Yunus warned on Saturday that political power struggles risked jeopardising gains that have been made.

""Broader unity is essential to maintain national stability, organise free and fair elections, justice, and reform, and permanently prevent the return of authoritarianism in the country,"" it said in a statement.

Microfinance pioneer Yunus, who returned from exile at the behest of protesters in August 2024, says he has a duty to implement democratic reforms before elections he has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.

The caretaker government has formed multiple reform commissions providing a long list of recommendations -- and is now seeking the backing of political parties.

Yunus last held an all-party meeting -- to discuss efforts to overhaul Bangladesh's democratic system -- on February 15, and some parties cited frustration at the lack of contact.

But on Saturday, the government warned that it had faced ""unreasonable demands, deliberately provocative and jurisdictionally overreaching statements"", which it said had been ""continuously obstructing"" its work.

Sources in his office and a key political ally said on Thursday that Yunus had threatened to quit, but his cabinet said he would not step down early.

Yunus on Saturday met with the the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), seen as the election front-runners, who are pushing hard for polls to be held by December.

According to Bangladeshi media and military sources, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman also said this week that elections should be held by December, aligning with BNP demands.

Yunus also met with leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, the Muslim-majority nation's largest Islamist party, and the National Citizen Party (NCP) made up of many students who spearheaded the uprising that ended Hasina's rule.

NCP leader Nahid Islam warned on Saturday that rival parties were pushing for swift elections to skip reforms and ""assume power"", and that he believed there were ""indications"" that a ""military-backed government could re-emerge"".

Cracks In Pakistan-China's 'Iron Brotherhood'? Why Dragon Is Afraid Of Fully Backing Islamabad,"Cracks In Pakistan-China's 'Iron Brotherhood'? Why Dragon Is Afraid Of Fully Backing Islamabad

Curated By :

News18.com

Last Updated: May 24, 2025, 12:22 IST

Analysts point to seven strategic factors that underscore China's reluctance to fully commit to Pakistan's aggressive posturing against India.

China President Xi Jinping

The long-standing “Iron Brotherhood"" between China and Pakistan, once considered unbreakable, appears to be showing signs of strain. India’s robust response to Pahalgam terrorist attack has put the spotlight on Beijing’s stance. While observers keenly watched for an unequivocal show of support for Islamabad, China’s response has been marked by diplomatic caution and a notable absence of direct condemnation against India.

This shift in Beijing’s approach is not arbitrary as analysts point to seven strategic factors that underscore China’s evolving calculations and its reluctance to fully commit to Pakistan’s aggressive posturing against India. Here’s a look at seven key reasons behind China’s calculated restraint:

Recommended Stories

1. Massive Trade Stakes with India

With annual trade exceeding $140 billion, China understands that escalating tensions with India would inflict severe damage on its own economy. India has emerged as one of China’s largest export markets, a crucial factor especially as global supply chains are increasingly diversifying away from Chinese manufacturing hubs. Beijing cannot afford to jeopardize such a significant economic partnership.

2. Maintaining Border De-escalation

Following the deadly Galwan Valley clash in 2020, both China and India have engaged in concerted efforts to reduce border tensions. Openly endorsing Pakistan’s terror agenda would not only negate these diplomatic achievements but also risk India imposing further restrictions on Chinese technology, akin to the app bans witnessed previously. Beijing prioritizes border stability to avoid renewed friction.

3. Global South Leadership Aspirations:

China actively seeks to position itself as a leader of the Global South, a bloc that champions development, stability, and peaceful coexistence. An overt endorsement of Pakistan’s alleged terrorist tactics would severely undermine this carefully cultivated image, eroding trust and credibility among nations that value peace over conflict.

4. Safeguarding Belt and Road Investments:

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a cornerstone of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, is already highly vulnerable to internal insecurity and terrorism within Pakistan. A full-blown India-Pakistan conflict would place China’s multi-billion-dollar investments at severe risk. Incidents like the attacks on Chinese engineers in Pakistan have already sown seeds of doubt in Beijing.

5. Subtle Strategy Over Direct Confrontation:

China’s foreign policy often favors indirect pressure and strategic signaling over outright confrontation. While it continues to support Pakistan through arms sales, diplomatic backing at the UN, and backdoor channels, Beijing carefully calibrates its actions to avoid providing India with a pretext for open hostility. Its influence is exerted through nuanced means, not overt aggression.

6. The ‘Double Game’ of Diplomacy

China maintains a delicate diplomatic balance by condemning terrorism globally while simultaneously using its veto power to block international sanctions against Pakistan-based terrorist organizations. This allows Beijing to project an image of being peace-loving to the world while simultaneously demonstrating loyalty and reliability to Pakistan, a strategic ‘double game’ that offers significant political flexibility.

7. Growing US-India Strategic Alignment

The burgeoning strategic ties between India and the United States, particularly through initiatives like QUAD and potential bilateral trade agreements, are a significant concern for China. Beijing is acutely aware that openly siding with Pakistan could further push India firmly into the American orbit, fundamentally altering the regional power balance in a way that is unfavorable to China’s long-term interests.

"Long advantageous, Harvard's China ties become a political liability","Summary Trump administration accuses school of 'coordinating' with China

U.S. lawmakers have expressed worries about Chinese government influence on campuses

Harvard accused of training sanctioned Chinese officials

WASHINGTON, May 23 (Reuters) - Harvard University's links to China, long an asset to the school, have become a liability as the Trump administration levels accusations that its campus is plagued by Beijing-backed influence operations.

On Thursday the administration moved to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, saying it fostered antisemitism and coordinated with the Chinese Communist Party. Among them are Chinese nationals who made up about a fifth of Harvard's foreign student intake in 2024, the university said.

Sign up here.

A U.S. judge on Friday temporarily blocked the administration's order after the Cambridge, Massachusetts, university sued.

The concerns about Chinese government influence at Harvard are not new. Some U.S. lawmakers, many of them Republicans, have expressed worries that China is manipulating Harvard to gain access to U.S. advanced technology, to circumvent U.S. security laws and to stifle criticism of it in the United States.

""For too long, Harvard has let the Chinese Communist Party exploit it,"" a White House official told Reuters on Friday, adding the school had ""turned a blind eye to vigilante CCP-directed harassment on-campus.""

Harvard did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

The school has said the revocation was a punishment for Harvard's ""perceived viewpoint,"" which it called a violation of the right to free speech as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

Harvard’s links to China, which include research partnerships and China-focused academic centers, are longstanding. The ties have yielded major financial gifts, influence in international affairs and global prestige for the school.

Former Harvard President Larry Summers, who has at times been critical of the university, called the Trump administration's move to block foreign students the most serious attack on the university to date.

""It's hard to imagine a greater strategic gift to China than for the United States to sacrifice its role as a beacon to the world,"" he said in an interview with Politico.

HEALTH TRAINING

In a statement, the Chinese embassy in Washington said: ""Educational exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States are mutually beneficial and should not be stigmatized.""

The presence of Chinese students at Harvard and the school's links to the country are not evidence of wrongdoing. But the complexity and overlapping nature of the connections have been opaque enough to attract attention and criticism.

The China-related issues cited by the Trump administration echo the work of the Republican-led House of Representatives' Select Committee on China.

For example, Harvard provided public health-related training to Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) officials after 2020. That year the U.S. imposed sanctions on the Chinese paramilitary organization for its role in alleged human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

The Department of Homeland Security said those engagements with XPCC continued ""as recently as 2024.""

China vehemently denies any accusations of wrongdoing in Xinjiang, but both the Trump and Biden administrations have defined Beijing's policies in the region as ""genocide.""

In another episode that has drawn questions, U.S. business intelligence firm Strategy Risks said that Ronnie Chan, who facilitated a $350 million donation to Harvard in 2014 that led to its school of public health being named for his father, property developer T.H. Chan, is a member of the China-United States Exchange Foundation.

The Hong Kong-based organization, which says its aim is to foster dialogue between the two countries, has been classified as a foreign principal under U.S. law, requiring U.S. lobbyists working for it to disclose that work to the U.S. government.

FORMER PROFESSOR CONVICTED

Former Harvard Professor Charles Lieber was scrutinized by a Trump program started in 2018 called the China Initiative , which was focused on fighting Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft and investigated researchers and universities over whether they disclosed financial ties to Beijing.

The initiative was halted under the Biden administration after critics said it led to racial profiling and a culture of fear that chilled scientific collaboration.

U.S. lawmakers from both parties have expressed worries about the efforts by Beijing-linked student associations to monitor political activities. In April 2024, a Harvard student activist was physically ejected from an event by a Chinese exchange student - not faculty or security staff - for interrupting a speech by China's Ambassador Xie Feng.

loading

Pressure has mounted on Harvard in Trump's second term, with the Education Department in April asking the university to provide records on its foreign funding after it said a review of required reporting on large foreign-source gifts and contracts revealed incomplete and inaccurate disclosures.

The Trump administration's moves against Harvard have nonetheless alarmed some China experts.

Yaqiu Wang, a U.S.-based human rights researcher who came to the U.S. from China as a student, said the Trump administration's move to ban foreign students at Harvard was ""completely counterproductive.""

""The concerns over the Chinese government's transnational repression attempts to silence critics are very legitimate, and also espionage concerns are legitimate."" Wang said. ""But to try to address that by banning, not only Chinese students, but foreign students, is just beyond comprehension.""

UAE hits record May temperature of 51.6C,"Dubai residents attempt to cool off at night at the Umm Suqeim beach as temperatures sizzle above 50 degrees Celsius (112 Fahrenheit)

""The highest temperature recorded over the country today is 51.6C in Sweihan (Al Ain) at 13:45 UAE local time (0945 GMT),"" the National Center of Meteorology said in a post on X, just 0.4C off the overall heat record in the Gulf country.

The meteorology office told AFP the highest ever temperature recorded in the UAE since documentation began in 2003 was reported at 52C on Abu Dhabi's Al Yasat Island in 2010.

The desert nation, a top global oil exporter, lies in one of the planet's hottest regions and one which is particularly vulnerable to climate change.

The temperature in Sweihan -- which lies 97km (60 miles) west of Abu Dhabi -- and of 50.4C a day earlier in the Emirati capital exceeded the previous record for May of 50.2 Celsius recorded in 2009, according to the meteorology office.

On Saturday in Dubai, where high temperatures in the mid-40 degrees Celsius were recorded, motorists complained air conditioning in their cars was struggling to stifle the sweltering heat, surprised the phenomenon had hit so early in the year.

On the streets, Dubai inhabitants were still out and about -- some armed with parasols -- and vendors selling water and local juice bars appeared to enjoy an uptick in customers.

The UAE, host of the COP28 climate talks in 2023, has just emerged from a record-breaking April with an average daily high of 42.6 degrees Celsius.

Extremely hot days

Scientists have shown that recurring heatwaves are a clear marker of global warming and that these heatwaves are set to become more frequent, longer and more intense.

The number of extremely hot days has nearly doubled globally in the past three decades.

Outdoor workers in Arab states face some of the highest exposure to heat stress in the world, with 83.6 percent suffering from excessive heat exposure on the job, according to a 2024 report from the International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency.

The risks from a warming planet were on stark display last June, when more than 1,300 people died while performing the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, according to an official tally -- most of them unauthorised pilgrims exposed to long periods outdoors.

According to a 2022 Greenpeace study, the Middle East is at high risk of water and food scarcity as well as severe heat waves as a result of climate change.

The report, which focused on six countries including the UAE, found the region was warming nearly twice as fast as the global average, making its food and water supplies ""extremely vulnerable"" to climate change.

Germany mass stabbing suspect has psychological illness: police,"A German woman accused of a mass stabbing attack that wounded 18 people at a train station in Hamburg suffers from mental illness, police said on Saturday.

The suspect, a 39-year-old woman, is accused of going on a stabbing spree on Friday at the main station in Hamburg, stunning the northern city in the middle of the evening rush hour.

The woman has “very clear indications of a psychological illness”, police said in a statement, without giving further details on her condition. They added that there were no signs she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack, which left four victims seriously wounded.

The woman was subdued by two passersby and law enforcement officers before being taken into custody at the scene without resisting arrest, police said. She was due to appear before a judge later on Saturday.

Police say they have ruled out a “political motive” for the attack and believe the suspect acted alone.

The victims range in age from 19 to 85.

The four in serious condition were a 24-year-old man and three women, aged 24, 52 and 85, police said. Emergency officials initially said their wounds were life-threatening, but police say all the victims now appear to be out of immediate danger.

Rush hour

The attack took place just after 6:00 pm (1600 GMT) on Friday on one of the platforms in front of a standing train, German media reported.

The suspect was thought to have turned “against passengers” at the station, a spokeswoman for the Hanover federal police directorate, which also covers Hamburg, told AFP.

Some of the victims were treated on board waiting trains in the station, German daily Bild reported.

Images of the scene showed access to the platforms at one end of the station blocked off by police and people being loaded into waiting ambulances. Forensic police could also be seen walking up and down the platforms where the attack took place.

Forensic police officers investigate on the railway platform at Hamburg’s main train station where at least 12 people were injured in a knife attack on May 23. — AFP

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed his shock in a call with the mayor of Hamburg.

“My thoughts are with the victims and their families,” Merz said, according to a readout from a spokesman.

Germany has been rocked in recent months by a series of violent attacks with often extremist motivations that have put security at the top of the agenda.

The most recent, on Sunday, saw four people injured in a stabbing at a bar in the city of Bielefeld.

The investigation into that attack has been handed over to federal prosecutors after the Syrian suspect told the police officers who arrested him that he had extremist beliefs.

The question of security, and the immigrant origin of some of the attackers, was a major topic during Germany’s recent election campaign.

Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU topped the February vote, which also saw a record score of more than 20 per cent for the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD).

Last year, Germany toughened its legislation on carrying knives, now banned at public gatherings and on long-distance trains. They are also banned in specific zones in some cities, including Hamburg’s train station.

Experts and police unions have previously questioned whether such bans are effective.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913073/germany-mass-stabbing-suspect-has-psychological-illness-police,World
Qatar: Authorities’ Religious Discrimination Against Baha’is,"Click to expand Image The Ministry of Interior Office in Doha, Qatar, May 5, 2021. © 2021 Shutterstock

(Beirut) – Qatari authorities have discriminated against members of the Baha’i faith, including with unlawful detentions, based solely on their religious identity, Human Rights Watch said today.

Qatari authorities arrested and detained Remy Rowhani on April 28, 2025. Rowhani is the chair of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Qatar, an elected body that governs the affairs of Baha’is in Qatar. Rowhani was previously released from a prior detention in January 2025 following the completion of a one-month prison sentence.

“The Baha’i community of Qatar has endured decades of government discrimination and intimidation, and authorities have consistently ignored community leaders repeated efforts to engage the government in dialogue and seek redress,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “This state-sponsored discrimination poses a threat to the very existence of the Baha’i community of Qatar.”

Qatar’s government has discriminated against Baha’is in Qatar for decades, with hundreds of people harmed by a pattern of punishment and discriminatory policies. The government has deported as many as 14 members of the group for no apparent reason other than individuals belonging to the Baha’i faith in cases Human Rights Watch documented from 2003 to 2025. Qatari authorities have also previously terminated the employment of a Baha’i member and refused to grant a certificate of good conduct, which is required for employment in Qatar, to four members of the group.

Qatar’s Interior Ministry did not respond to a request from Human Rights Watch for more information about the cases.

Many Baha’is in Qatar fear raising public alarm over their cases because of the danger of reprisals and further discriminatory actions, and informed source told Human Rights Watch.

Islam is Qatar’s official religion. And while the Qatari constitution guarantees freedom to practice religious rites, Qatari authorities have discriminated against the Baha’i minority in the country in administrative and legal matters. A high-ranking Qatari religious figure told one of the now-deported Baha’is that if he announced his conversion to Sunni Islam, he could “make the deportation go away.”

The Baha’i religion, established in Iran in the 19th century by Baha’u’llah, believes that the prophets of all major faiths come from the same one God, and is centered around the unity of the human race.

In addition to the deportations, officials have delayed the community’s attempts to reestablish an existing Baha’i cemetery and refused to accept marriage certificates issued by elected Baha’i institutions in Qatar. Baha’is have also faced discrimination elsewhere in the region, including the crime against humanity of persecution in Iran and other forms of repression in Egypt and Yemen.

In 2021, Qatari authorities charged Rowhani under articles 4 and 42(5) of Law No. (15) of 2014 on the Regulation of Charitable Activities for collecting funds in 2013 and 2014 “without permission from the Board [of Directors of the Regulatory Authority for Charitable Activities],” according to court documents reviewed by Human Rights Watch. This law took effect after being published in the country’s official gazette on October 2, 2014. The retrospective application of the penalties under this law contradicts article 40 of Qatar’s constitution and article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

The charges were based on Rowhani’s collection of donations from Baha’is in Qatar as part of his role on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Qatar, the Baha’i International Community (BIC) said. Financial donations are considered a religious obligation (but without pressure or coercion from other Baha’is or Baha’i institutions) and are central to the Baha’i faith.

Article 18 of the ICCPR protects the freedom to practice religion, as does the Universal Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.

Rowhani was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of 100,000 Qatari Riyals (US$27,470), later reduced to one month in prison and a fine of QR 50,000 ($13,700), according to court documents. Rowhani learned of the decision issued in absentia in April 2021 through a letter posted to his home address in Doha.

Despite verbal assurances from immigration authorities that he was free to travel, Rowhani was arrested on December 23, 2024, at Hamad International Airport in Doha, an informed source told Human Rights Watch. He was summoned to the State Security Criminal Investigations Department for questioning and detained again on April 28 under Law No. (14) of the 2014 Cybercrime Prevention Law, the BIC said, and court documents reviewed by Human Rights Watch showed.

He was charged with “disseminating news, photos or video or audio recording related to the sanctity of people’s private or family life, even if the same is true,” the documents say. This charge carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and/or a fine of QR 100,000 ($27,465).

Those charges relate to an account on X created five years ago that represents the Qatari Baha’i community, the BIC said. Human Rights Watch reviewed the posts on the X account and found them to be limited to celebrating Qatari holidays and Baha’i values.

“The charges against Remy Rowhani are not just an attack on one individual, they are an assault on the entire Baha’i community of Qatar,” said Dr. Saba Haddad, a Baha’i International Community Representative to the United Nations in Geneva. “This unjust targeting seeks to intimidate a peaceful religious group solely because of their faith, and to undermine principles of religious tolerance and social cohesion.”

Qatari authorities also issued a deportation order in January 2025 for a Baha’i individual, without justification, an informed source told Human Rights Watch. He was born and raised in Qatar to Iranian parents and had lived there for 52 years during which he founded a company, got married, and had his daughter. He was also a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is in Qatar, the source said.

He was summoned to the Immigration Department on January 8, where a police officer informed him that he was to be deported for “disrupting public order” and that he had one week to leave Qatar, the source said. The officer in charge cited “immense pressure from above” to deport this person in particular, the source told Human Rights Watch. The Interior Ministry’s communication with the individual about the deportation was entirely verbal, the source said.

The individual continued to request weekly extensions until late February, when an influential Qatari friend intervened on his behalf, and he was given until March 26 to leave the country. His written request to the Ministry of Interior to reconsider the deportation order received no response. He left Qatar on March 22 and was told by officials that he is blacklisted, barring him from reentry.

This follows a series of deportations and blacklisting of Baha’is by Qatari authorities for over 20 years, as documented by the United Nations special rapporteurs on minority issues and freedom of religion or belief. According to their 2019 report, Qatari authorities’ discriminatory treatment against Baha’is has resulted in the separation of families and the loss of employment and income.

“The Qatari government’s discriminatory policies have created an environment of fear of family separation and loss of employment among Baha’is in the country,” Page said. “Qatar should immediately stop deporting and blacklisting Baha’is and provide effective remedy for those affected.”",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/25/qatar-authorities-religious-discrimination-against-bahais,World
