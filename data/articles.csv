That camera module has two lenses and a flash. It will also bring a curved design on the front and the back. Tecno describes this new look as “futuristic” and says that it is inspired by the aerodynamic form of starships. The Space theme continues with stylistic metal engravings and texts on the back of the Tecno Pova Curve.





The teasers also confirmed that the Pova Curve is made on Tecno’s 3B philosophy: Best Design, Best Signal, and Best AI. Among other features, Tecno plans to boast some of the new AI tools Pova Curve has in stock, including “ELLA,” the AI voice assistant. As the phone inches closer to launch, the Tecno rate list will likely reflect its placement among other AI-focused midrangers.

The assistant is based on a voice and text engine that could answer questions and solve the problems users face in their day-to-day. Just like Infinix’s Folax assistant, this might also rely on DeepSeek’s R1 AI model, which should give you an idea about ELLA’s capabilities and potential limits.





This year’s gaming series from Tecno is meant to have several more devices: the base Tecno Pova 7 (LJ6), Pova 7 5G (LJ7), going all the way up to the premium segment with Pova 7 Pro 5G (LJ8) and Pova Curve (LJ8k). The highest-end variant might be a Pova 7 Pro+ 5G (LJ9).

Xiaomi Poco F7 Alleged for June Launch Following the NBTC Certification,"Usama Rasool May 23, 2025

Xiaomi Poco F7 has cleared yet another regulatory hurdle, appearing on Thailand’s NBTC certification site. The listing confirms once again that it’s headed for the global market. While it was initially expected to launch in late May, the timeline seems to have shifted, with a release likely happening next month instead.





The Poco F7 has been assigned the model number “25053PC47G.” The letter “G” at the end indicates that the device will be making a global debut soon. Thailand’s regulatory body NBTC has green-lit the Poco F7 for launch in the region. Now, we wait for the company to make an official announcement.

Latest Poco Xiaomi Mobile 2025 Price in Pakistan

There are no official details to be found on the web, though leakers have been relentlessly following the Poco F7 throughout its development phase. Apparently, this device is a rebranded Redmi Turbo 4 Pro that’s exclusively available in China.





Xiaomi often passes on the Redmi Turbo models to the global markets as rebranded Poco devices. If the latest Poco Xiaomi mobile is indeed the Redmi Turbo 4 Pro with the nameplate switched out, we might be looking at a near-flagship device with a powerful SoC and a massive battery.

Poco F7 might show up on the global stage with a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chip, 12GB or 16GB RAM, and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. The display is also set to impress, as it claims to have an HDR brightness of 3200 nits. This will be an AMOLED 6.83” screen with 1.5k resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.





The camera here is not as over-the-top as the Poco F7 Pro or Ultra, but it is serviceable, giving you a 50 MP sensor for the primary lens and an 8 MP ultrawide shooter. The selfie camera will probably be a 20 MP sensor hidden inside a punch-hole cutout.

Use Sora AI For Free With Microsoft’s Bing Video Creator,"Microsoft is stepping into the AI video generation space by offering access to OpenAI’s powerful Sora AI model through its upcoming Bing Video Creator for free.







Bing Image Creator is already one of the user’s favorite tools for image generation. Microsoft is taking things to the next step with its Bing Video Creator, allowing users to create AI videos with Sora AI support.

Unlike OpenAI’s direct Sora access, which is typically part of paid ChatGPT plans, Microsoft’s Bing Video Creator will allow users to generate AI videos using text prompts without a subscription cost. It is currently in Beta and is being teased for desktop and through the Bing mobile app on Android and iOS.

This free access comes with some limitations, too. OpenAI’s full Sora model allows more advanced functionalities like uploading images or combining video clips. Bing Video Creator will primarily focus on generating videos from text prompts. This means users will describe their desired video scene in words, and the AI will bring it to life.







Users with Microsoft Reward points will have the option to use them for faster video generation speeds, offering a way to enhance the free experience.

By integrating Sora into Bing, Microsoft is positioning itself as a key player in the generative AI landscape. But it’s worth noting that the AI video generation market is rapidly evolving. Google’s Veo and other tools like Kling AI are also making significant advancements in this area. So, we will have to wait and see how well Microsoft’s Video Creator will perform.",https://www.techjuice.pk/use-sora-ai-for-free-with-microsofts-bing-video-creator/,Technology
Equal1 unveils plug-and-play silicon qubit system,"Boffin's from Equal1 have just emerged from their smoke filled labs with a box which can use both quantum and traditional computing.

The Irish outfit revealed its Bell-1 system which is a six-qubit contraption weighing just over 200 kilograms that slots neatly into a standard GPU server rack. Unlike most quantum rigs that look like props from a bad sci-fi film, this one’s as tidy as a regular server and doesn’t need a dedicated chamber cooled by the frozen blood of demons and unicorn tears.

It hums away at a numbing 0.3 kelvin, thanks to its built-in cryogenic unit, which is all the more impressive considering it plugs into a standard mains socket.

While most of the quantum crowd are still faffing about with bulky superconducting or ion-trap qubits, Equal1’s gone for silicon-based spin qubits. They’re smaller, scalable and can be churned out using the same gear as conventional chips, meaning you can pack more quantum cats, both dead and alive, into one box.

Its UnityQ chip fuses quantum processing units, Arm CPUs and neural processors onto a single slice of silicon. That sidesteps the headache of getting classical and quantum components to synchronise like a badly rehearsed choir.

The chip already includes error correction, control, and readout, meaning less faffing about with external gear and more time running computations that might collapse your cat’s waveform.

“Plug it in and it's ready to work,” Equal1's reps said, as if quantum computing were no more exotic than a microwave.

It’s only got six qubits for now, but the architecture is built to scale. Early buyers won’t need to bin their kit when more powerful models land—they can just swap the chip and keep their feline-themed quantum fantasies going.

Equal1’s December 2024 research showed off the world’s highest single- and two-qubit gate fidelity and speed, aided by an AI-powered error correction system whipped up with help from Arm.

The cocaine nose jobs of Wall Street haven’t leapt aboard yet, but if Equal1 keeps this up, quantum cats everywhere might finally have a home they can simultaneously die and thrive in.",https://www.fudzilla.com/news/ai/61083-equal1-unveils-plug-and-play-silicon-qubit-system,Technology
Anker Nebula X1 Home Projector Review: Gorgeous Anywhere,"The world’s first home projector was the Pathé KOK Home Cinematograph. Launched in 1912, it used 28-millimeter film and a hand crank. Thanks to this kernel of an idea, I've just watched a film on the new Anker Nebula X1, in my garden, projected in 4K Ultra High Definition, onto a 120-inch screen, with a genuinely thrilling 4.1.2 surround-sound speaker system.

At home, I've never had the space, budget or patience to install a full-scale home cinema. But I do love the big screen, and in the pursuit of something close to a compromise I have tested dozens of superb portable projectors. As mobile technology has improved, these tiny Android-toting boxes of fun have made it possible for anyone to stream content onto a blank wall, screen, or the side of a tent. But none have come closer to looking and sounding like a proper home cinema than the Anker Nebula X1.

Photograph: Chris Haslam

Anyone familiar with Anker's range of portable projectors will recognize the X1. It looks like the big brother of the excellent Cosmos Laser 4K ($2000). Externally there are similarities for sure, but inside ""the world’s first cinema-grade outdoor entertainment system"" is a completely reengineered beast, with 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness, 5,000:1 contrast ratio, liquid cooling, a built-in micro gimbal, and AI powered setup, plus the possibility of adding two wireless satellite speakers to give it true 4.2.2 surround sound, and mics for karaoke.

But to get the best from it you'll need to spend big, and with fierce competition from brands including XGIMI, Hisense, and BenQ, is it worth your money? I think so.

Screen Time

The Nebula X1 can project up to a 200-inch image from between 13 to 22 feet thanks to its optical zoom. The built-in gimbal (an industry first) tilts up to 25 degrees to help it align with your chosen surface, while keystone correction, focus (there's a 1.67x optical zoom), and ambient light are all tweaked automatically. This is all done via a single button on the remote control, making it one of the easiest projectors I've set up.

There's also AI Spatial Recall, which is a fancy way to describe the fact that the projector can remember where it is and how big you like the screen. This setting works well but isn't always 100 percent—it needs to be placed pretty close to the original position—but you can tweak screen angle and focus manually too.

I've not got the space for a 200-inch display, but I did witness it during a product preview in a cinema screening room. Yes, lighting and screen conditions were optimal, but I was still impressed by the detail and brightness created by the combination of 3,500 ANSI Lumen brightness, 4K (3840 × 2160) resolution and a cinema-grade 14-element all-glass lens.",https://www.wired.com/review/anker-nebula-x1-home-projector/,Technology
Google Unveils SynthID Detector to Identify AI-Generated Content,"Google unveiled the SynthID Detector at Google I/O 2025, a groundbreaking tool designed to identify AI-generated content. This verification system, which was created by Google DeepMind, is intended to identify the material produced by Google’s AI models, including Gemini, Imagen, Lyria, and Veo.







How SynthID Detector Works

SynthID Detector scans multiple types of media—images, audio, video, and text—for invisible watermarks. These watermarks are embedded during the content creation process using SynthID. They’re designed to remain intact, even after editing or transformations, ensuring the source can still be verified without degrading quality.

When users upload content to the portal, the tool analyzes it for these hidden markers. If any are found, SynthID highlights the specific areas that are likely AI-generated. This gives users a clear, segment-by-segment breakdown of the content’s authenticity.

Expanding Transparency in AI Media

SynthID has undergone a rapid transformation since its inception as a watermarking solution for AI-generated images. It now accommodates a wider range of content formats, such as text, audio, and video. Such AI detector watermarks have been integrated into over 10 billion pieces of content to date.







Access and Future Roadmap

Currently, SynthID Detector is only available to early testers. Google plans a wider release via a waitlist, allowing the company to gather feedback and fine-tune the tool before full deployment.

This launch is part of Google’s broader mission to promote responsible AI use. By giving people the ability to verify digital content at its source, tools like AI Detector aim to build trust, ensure accountability, and counter misinformation in the age of synthetic media.",https://www.techjuice.pk/google-unveils-synthid-detector-to-identify-ai-generated-content/,Technology

iOS 18.5 perhaps isn’t the biggest update in the year of iOS 18, but it still introduces a range of helpful updates and features. Every time a new version of iOS is released, I always rush to check out the new features. After all, who knows what additions could make using my smartphone that extra bit easier?

Because I’ve gone through all the new iOS 18.5 features, you don’t necessarily have to — but you still might want to. So, after you stop procrastinating and update your iPhone, try out all the new iOS 18.5 features below. I'll also explain why you should give them a closer look.

Apple Mail got a pretty substantial refresh recently, and while the changes in iOS 18.5 aren’t quite as major, there are still a few changes that could be helpful.

Some of those features include settings that you can control straight from the Mail app itself, instead of having to dig through the iOS settings menu. Now, when you hit the three-dot menu button on the top right-hand corner, you'll be able to toggle contact photos, which you may or may not want activated.

Not many people know about Back Tap, but it's a pretty handy feature that lets you trigger an action simply by tapping the back of your phone either two or three times. With iOS 18.5, there’s finally a setting that lets you get an alert when you’ve triggered Back Tap — including telling you how many times you tapped the back of the phone.

This new feature isn't enabled by default. To access it, you'll have to open the Settings app, then head to Accessibility, then Touch. Go all the way to the bottom of the screen and select Back Tap. Here, you'll be able to toggle on the Show Banner option, as well as access the other Back Tap settings that were previously available.

Know when your kids have cracked the code

Screen Time is getting some changes in iOS 18.5 too, largely in the form of what parents have access to. With the update, parents will now be notified when their Screen Time passcode has been entered into their child's device, which will alert parents when their kids have figured out the code. It may be hard to stop your child from trying to figure out your code, but at least now you'll know when they do so.

Set a charging limit

Apple is adding more settings to the battery section of the Settings app, too. The common thinking suggests that constantly charging the battery to 100% will degrade its health over long-term usage, and if you plan on holding onto your device for more than a few years, it may be worth setting a battery charge limit to help prevent this. To access this setting, head to the Settings app and go to the battery section. Then tap on the charging option. From here, you will be able to set a charge limit using a slider, with the limit anywhere between 80% and 100%.

Of course, it should be noted that if you set the battery charge limit to 90% percent, you'll never be able to use more than 90% percent of the battery – and if you had it set to 100% it would take years before the battery degraded enough to last the equivalent of 90% of a new battery. For most, a better option is to use the “Optimized Battery Charging” feature, which charges the device to 80% during day-to-day charges but allows your device to reach 100% when your phone thinks you'll need to use it.

Try out the new Pride Harmony wallpaper

iOS 18.5 also includes a new Pride Harmony wallpaper in celebration of Pride Month. iOS already includes a range of Pride wallpapers, but if you're curious about the new one, you can access it by opening the Settings app, scrolling down to Wallpaper, and following the on-screen prompts to change your wallpaper. You can access a version of the wallpaper for your iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch.

Plus a few more iOS 18 features we love...

Since iOS 18.5 was a lighter update, we also wanted to share some of the best iOS 18 features you may have missed.

If you want to make your iPhone even more useful, try these new features and tools:

Call recording and transcribing

Originally introduced with iOS 18.1, this is an incredibly handy feature for journalists — or anyone who needs to take notes on a call. With this feature, you can record a phone calls (and get a surprisingly accurate transcription) directly within iPhone. When you're on a call, click the waveform icon in the upper-left of the screen. Then, you'll see a notification (and the person on the other end of the call will hear a notification) to start recording the call.

Eight new emojis!

April's update to iOS 18.4 brought something huge: Eight new emojis.

Specifically, we got:

Face with Bags Under Eyes

Fingerprint

Splatter

Root vegetable

Leafless tree

Harp

Shovel

The Sark flag

"Deals: Galaxy S24 FE and A56 get a free watch, Poco X7 and F7 prices fall","Samsung is running a “Sweet Summertime Upgrade” promotion, meaning that several Galaxy models are paired with a free Galaxy Watch7. The two we picked are the S24 FE and A56.

The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is £100 off at the moment and seeing how the 256GB variant is only £60 more than the 128GB one, that’s the one we’d recommend – storage is non-expandable and 128GB is pretty tight.

The phone’s Exynos 2400e is pretty zippy and the 50+8+12MP camera setup includes a 75mm 3x telephoto camera. The battery situation is typical for Samsung with 5,000mAh capacity and 25W wired charging, but at least you also get 15W wireless – that and the tele camera are pretty rare for this price range. That and the promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.

The Samsung Galaxy A56 is almost £180 cheaper for the same 8/256GB configuration. However, the 2400e is 70-80% faster (sometimes more) than the Exynos 1580, so these savings come at a cost – and that cost includes losing the tele camera. There’s faster 45W wired charging for the slightly larger 5,000mAh battery (vs. 4,700mAh on the FE), but there is no wireless charging. The A56 will receive 6 years of support, but since it is one year newer than the S24 FE, support for both will end around the same time.

And here is the freebie that comes with both phones, the Samsung Galaxy Watch7. By the looks of it, you can only get the 40mm model – that is just north of £200 right now (£290 MSRP). It has a 1.3” display and a 300mAh battery. You can read more about the offer and claim the watch here.

As a reminder, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is launching next week. During the pre-order period you get a free storage upgrade to 512GB, £100 Samsung Credit and now Amazon has added a £100 discount for Prime Student members that wasn’t there last week.

The Poco X7 Pro price has fallen to £240 for the base 8/256GB model and £270 for the 12/512GB (a worthy upgrade for just £30). Three weeks ago those prices were £285 and £327, respectively.

The vanilla Poco X7 is a bit cheaper too, but the Pro model is better value for money. You lose a lot of performance going from a Dimensity 8400 Ultra with UFS 4.0 storage (X7 Pro) to Dimensity 7300 Ultra with UFS 2.2 storage (X7). The GPU in particular is in another class. You also lose battery capacity (5,110mAh vs. 6,000mAh) and charge speed (45W vs. 90W) and that does affect battery performance.

The Poco F7 Pro is noticeably pricier (£160 more) than the X7 Pro but its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is only marginally faster. There are other upgrades like the screen resolution (1440p+ vs. 1220p+), main camera sensor size (1/1.55” vs. 1/1.95”) and Wi-Fi 7, but the price premium can be hard to justify.

Finally, the Poco F7 Ultra price is where it was last week – another £160 upcharge. However, you get the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, plus a 50MP 2.5x/60mm telephoto camera and a higher resolution 32MP ultra-wide (vs. 8MP).

The 5,300mAh battery is smaller, but it supports both 120W wired and 50W wireless charging. Despite the seemingly large difference in capacity, battery life ends up being about the same. Check out our Poco F7 Pro vs. F7 Ultra article for camera samples and more details on how these two compare.

Using Olink proteomics to identify inflammatory biomarkers in the cere,"Introduction

The most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide is Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS),1 characterized by symmetrical ascending muscle weakness, reduced tendon reflexes, and different degrees of sensory involvement. Between 0.81 and 1.91 cases of GBS are reported for every 100,000 people annually.2 Men are more likely than women to develop the condition, with an incidence that rises by 20% for every ten years of age. Between 3% and 7% of people die from the condition, and up to 20% of people lose their ability to walk on their own six months after the illness first manifests.3,4 Though the exact cause of GBS is unknown, it is currently thought to be an autoimmune-mediated peripheral neuropathy. This process is brought on by molecular mimicry between gangliosides on the membranes of microorganisms and peripheral nerve cells,5 which activates the complement and macrophage systems, T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and other immune responses that cause demyelination and axonal damage in the peripheral nervous system, respectively, and ultimately advances the disease.6 The two most popular immunotherapies for treating GBS are plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin.7 In principle, immunotherapy should be started as soon as possible before irreversible neurological damage occurs. Still, because there are multiple subtypes and variants of GBS, there are no specific diagnostic biomarkers and a lack of targeted therapeutic interventions.8

Many biomarkers have been linked to GBS in recent years. These include decreased levels of TGOLN2 and NCAM1 and increased levels of APOC3 in the CSF of GBS patients compared to patients with noninflammatory neurological disease(NND),9 and serum C3 complement levels as a predictor of the prognosis of GBS and for tracking disease activity.10 In Guillain-Barre syndrome, Thomma et al discovered that high and sustained anti-GM1 antibody titers were linked to a poor prognosis.11 Although these biomarkers have been linked to GBS, the diagnosis has limits. Few of these biomarkers are being used clinically.12 Thus, searching for new GBS biomarkers is vital to learning more about the disease’s etiology, providing early and precise diagnosis, and enhancing patient outcomes.

Olink proteomics is the accurate detection of proteins based on the highly sensitive, particular, and excellently scalable proximity extension assay.13,14 This development has dramatically aided in identifying novel biomarkers for prognosis and disease prediction and improved comprehension of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and the distinctive signaling networks associated with particular diseases.15 In this paper, we analyzed the expression levels of CSF inflammation-related proteins in patients with GBS at the peak of the disease and in control patients using Olink proteomics technology. Additionally, logistic regression model building and bioinformatic analysis were carried out. To study the biomarkers of GBS cerebrospinal fluid to explore the role of immune inflammation in developing GBS and related mechanisms and to provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and targeted therapy of GBS.

Materials and Methods

Patient Selection and Clinical Data Collection

The experimental group consisted of twenty-three GBS patients hospitalized at the First Hospital of Harbin Medical University between January 2021 and December 2022. In contrast, the control group consisted of fourteen patients with NND. All patients in the experimental group were at the peak of the illness and satisfied the diagnostic requirements for Guillain-Barré syndrome.16 Exclusion of patients with infection, fever, and immunomodulatory therapy before baseline sampling. Clinical information about the patients was documented, such as their sex, age, duration of hospitalization, clinical signs and symptoms, blood counts, results from the CSF, and Hughes Functional Classification Scale score at the height of the illness.17,18 Every patient enrolled in the study signed an informed consent form, which was carried out in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The First Hospital Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University approved this study (No. 2019115).

Collection of CSF Specimens

All recruited patients had 2 mL of CSF extracted at their initial lumbar puncture following hospital admission, which was then kept in a refrigerator at −80°C.

Proteomics Analysis

A proximity extension assay from Olink, which analyzes 92 inflammation-related biomarkers simultaneously, was used to analyze CSF samples.19 In short, two antibody probes labeled with oligonucleotides attached to a target protein. The oligonucleotides then hybridize in pairs when the two probes are close. DNA polymerase is added, and this causes a DNA polymerization reaction that yields a distinct PCR target sequence. A microfluidic real-time PCR device (Signature Q100, OLINK) is then used to identify and measure the resultant DNA sequence. Following quality control and normalization of the resultant Ct data using a series of internal and external controls, the assay readings are reported as Normalized Protein Expression (NPX) values, where higher values correspond to higher protein expression levels.20,21

Bioinformatics Analysis

The protein expression levels in the two groups were compared differently in the Olink data results, and the Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Following screening correction, proteins were classified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) if their p-value was less than 0.05. DEPs were visualized in the R program using the ggplot2 package, pheatmap package, etc. The discovered DEPs were subjected to pathway enrichment studies by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO),22,23 with p values < 0.05 and q values < 0.05. In both the experimental and control groups, all 92 inflammation-associated biomarkers were subjected to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).24 Using DEPs as query proteins and Cytoscape for visualization, the STRING database ( http://string-db.org ) was used to evaluate protein-protein interactions (PPI) in functional protein binding networks.25 We used the cytoNCA topology analysis plugin to screen for key differentially expressed proteins using the Betweenness Centrality (BC) algorithm.26

Construction of Logistic Regression Models

Using SPSS 25.0 software, the R software rms package, the pROC package, and the multipleROC tool, we ran a one-way logistic regression analysis on 20 CSF DEPs. After the proteins were screened using the single-factor logistic regression analysis, they were subjected to a regression analysis using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in R software. This method was used to select features and confirm the appropriate tuning parameter (λ) for the LASSO logistic regression. Cross-validation was also employed. Finally, multifactorial stepwise logistic regression analysis was incorporated to apply statistically significant predictors, construct a predictive model, and plot risk column lines.27,28 The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the DEPs, and the area under the curve (AUC) was computed.29

GEO Data Validation

The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo ) provided us with the GSE133750 dataset. This dataset represents a transcriptome sequencing of the sciatic nerve in a rat animal model of GBS called experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN). We then used the R software’s DESeq2 package to estimate the levels of gene expression and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on peak EAN and control-adjusted p-values < 0.05 and |log2 fold change| ≥ 1, as well as DEGs. We used the ggplot2 package to visualize volcano plots. After finding the intersection of DEGs and DEPs, we analyzed the discovered DEGs for GO and KEGG pathway enrichment using the R software Venn diagram package and ggplot2 package to create Wayne diagrams.

Statistical Analysis

Software such as SPSS (version 25.0), GraphPad (version 8.0.2), R (version 4.3.0), and Cytoscape (version 3.9.1) were used for statistical data analysis. Data are provided as mean ± standard deviation (normal distribution) or median (P25, P75). The Wilcoxon rank sum test or the two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to compare the mean differences between the two groups. Pearson or Spearman conducted correlation analysis. Statistics were deemed significant if P<0.05.

Results

Clinical Characteristics of Patients in the GBS and NND Groups

This study comprised 37 samples, including 14 patients with NND and 23 with GBS. The general clinical characteristics of all subjects are shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Clinical Characteristics of the Study Population

Screening for Differentially Expressed Proteins in CSF

Details of the Olink proteomics technology’s identification of 92 inflammation-associated proteins are provided in Table S1 . We screened 20 differentially expressed proteins associated with the development of GBS compared to control patients. The majority of these belonged to the chemokine and cytokine groups ( Table S2 ). One protein (IL5) had its expression downregulated, whereas 19 other proteins (IL8, CD244, IL-17C, MCP-1, CXCL9, CXCL1, CD6, IL18, MCP-4, IL-10RB, IL-18R1, MMP-10, IL10, TNF, CD5, CXCL10, CCL28, TNFRSF9, and CCL20) had their expression raised (Figure 1A). Two clusters with distinct accumulation patterns were visible in the heatmaps of all 20 DEPs (Figure 1B), and Figure 1C displays the differences in protein expression between the GBS and NND groups.

Figure 1 Inflammation-related protein alterations were noted in both the NND and GBS groups. (A) Visualization of 92 biomarkers associated with inflammation using volcano plots. Proteins with significant differential expression are indicated by gray nodes; down-regulated proteins are indicated by blue nodes; and up-regulated proteins are indicated by red nodes. (B) The heatmap shows proteins linked to inflammation that are differentially expressed; red indicates high expression, and blue indicates low expression. Each row in the map represents a protein, and each column represents a sample. (C) A pod plot showing how 20 DEPs are expressed. *P<0.05; **P<0.01.

Bioinformatic Analysis of DEPs Associated with GBS Inflammation

We used GO and KEGG enrichment analysis to investigate the role of CSF DEPs in GBS in more detail. Cell chemotaxis, cellular response to LPS, cytokine activity, and other phrases were among the enriched GO terms displayed in Figure 2. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, viral proteins interacting with cytokines and cytokine receptors, chemokine signaling routes, IL-17 signaling pathways, TNF signaling pathways, and other pathways implicated in GBS pathogenesis were identified by KEGG enrichment analysis (Figure 3A). We also conducted GSEA analysis to investigate the signaling pathways enriched by the gene collection of CSF proteins from GBS patients (Figure 3B). These proteins were implicated in JAK-STAT signaling pathways, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and chemokine signaling pathways in this investigation. To vividly illustrate the connections between the proteins, we built a PPI network, as seen in Figure 3C. Six proteins were identified as important nodes in the PPI network, including TNF, CCL20, IL8, MCP-1, IL10, and IL5. This implies that they might have significant functions in GBS and could be useful biological indicators for GBS prediction.

(B) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) outcomes using 92 proteins linked to inflammation as the background. (C) PPI network analysis of differentially expressed proteins associated with inflammation.

Correlation Analysis Between Differentially Expressed Inflammatory Proteins

We further analyzed the correlation between DEPs in the CSF (Figure 4A). IL8 and MCP-1 (R = 0.812, P = 2.51×10−6), MCP-1 and CCL20 (R = 0.747, P = 4.21×10−5), CCL20 and IL8 (R = 0.726, P = 8.71×10−5), and CXCL10 and MCP-4 (R = 0.907, P = 2.41×10−9) were found to have high associations. This finding suggests the possibility of a synergistic expression profile across members of the chemokine family. The strongest connection in CSF was seen between TNFRSF9 and IL-10RB (R = 0.946, P = 1.03×10−11), and scatter plots were created using this information (Figure 4B). This may reflect the dynamic balance between pro-inflammatory (TNF) and anti-inflammatory (IL10) pathways during the acute phase of GBS.

(C) A heatmap showing the relationship between nine clinical characteristics and 20 inflammation-associated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The Spearman correlation coefficient, represented by the number in each cell, shows the correlation coefficient’s magnitude.

Correlation Analysis of DEPs with Clinical Features

As seen in Figure 4C, the relationships between each CSF protein and clinical characteristics were evaluated. CCL20 (R = 0.46, P = 0.037) demonstrated a positive correlation with hospitalization days, indicating that it might be a reflection of the course of the disease. Monocyte percentage, CXCL9 (R = 0.53, P = 0.014), and IL5 (R = 0.45, P = 0.031) showed a pattern of correlation, which could indicate monocyte-macrophage system activation. IL10 and CSF IgM were shown to be positively correlated (R = 0.47, P = 0.027). The three proteins that showed a positive connection with the Hughes score were MCP-4 (R = 0.48, P = 0.019), CXCL10 (R = 0.42, P = 0.042), and CCL28 (R = 0.47, P = 0.024). This implies that they may serve as indicators of the severity of the condition.

Constructing Logistic Regression Models

We created one-way logistic regression models for every protein in the CSF of GBS patients to assess the diagnostic potential of 20 DEPs, and we then displayed forest plots (Figure 5A). Sixteen potential proteins were initially identified as IL8, CD244, MCP-1, CXCL9, CXCL1, CD6, IL18, IL-10RB, IL-18R1, MMP-10, IL10, TNF, CCL28, TNFRSF9, CCL20, and IL5.

Figure 5 Models for logistic regression were built. (A) Forest plot of a one-way logistic regression analysis comparing the GBS group to the control group. Variable selection for the binary logistic regression model LASSO (B and C). The log (lambda) series was used to plot the coefficients. Based on ideal lambda values, six variables with non-zero coefficients were chosen. After verifying that lambda is the optimal parameter in the LASSO model, partial likelihood deviation (binomial deviation) curves were plotted against log (lambda), and dashed vertical lines were plotted according to the one standard error threshold. (D) Column plots of risk containing IL5 and CCL20 as predictors. (E) ROC curves for the GBS CCL20 diagnostic. (F) ROC curve for the GBS IL5 diagnostic. (G) CCL20+IL5 ROC curve for combined GBS diagnosis. *P<0.05.

The best predictors of the current risk variables were chosen by using the LASSO regression approach to the proteins tested in the one-way logistic regression analysis, as illustrated in Figure 5B and C. Six prospective predictors with non-zero coefficients were ultimately chosen from among the 16 pertinent variables: CXCL9, CD6, IL10, TNF, CCL20, and IL5.

Multifactorial logistic stepwise regression analysis was then used to introduce the features selected in the LASSO regression model and construct a predictive model to identify potential biomarkers. Among these, CCL20 and IL5 showed statistically significant differences and were plotted accordingly in the GBS risk nomogram (Figure 5D). This implies that IL5 downregulation and CCL20 overexpression may work together to predict GBS. An AUC of 0.748 for CCL20 (Figure 5E) and 0.705 for IL5 (Figure 5F) were obtained by ROC analysis. CCL20 and IL5 together had a better diagnostic capacity than either indicator alone (AUC of 0.807) (Figure 5G).

Predictive Value of DEPs for GBS Disease Severity

A mild group (Hughes ≤3 points, n = 16) and a severe group (Hughes >3 points, n = 7) were separated from the GBS patients in order to evaluate the relationship between CSF DEPs and the severity of GBS. We created a forest plot and conducted a one-way logistic regression analysis (Figure 6A). The results showed that MCP-4 and CCL28 were significantly correlated with disease severity and could be used as potential predictors for the diagnosis of severe GBS. The AUC values of seven proteins (MCP-1, CXCL1, MCP-4, MMP-10, CXCL10, CCL28, and CCL20) were found to be >0.7 when the predictive power of DEPs for severe GBS was examined using ROC curves (Figure 6C). Of them, MCP-4’s diagnostic value (AUC=0.804) outperformed the other six DEPs. With an AUC of 0.857, the seven DEPs indicated severe GBS (Figure 6B). However, more functional studies are required to confirm if these markers directly influence the course of the disease.

Validation of DEPs at mRNA Level Using GEO Data

We acquired the sciatic nerve transcriptome data of the EAN rat model from the GEO database (GSE133750) in order to confirm the accuracy of the proteomics findings. Rats’ peripheral nerve tissues during the peak of EAN showed significantly different mRNA expression from controls, according to statistical analysis. A volcano plot was created, showing 126 genes with up-regulated expression and 11 with down-regulated expression (Figure 7A). A Venn diagram was created by intersecting the 137 DEGs in EAN with the 20 DEPs in GBS (Figure 7B). The findings demonstrated a substantial upregulation of MCP-1 and CXCL9 at the mRNA and protein levels. The involvement of MCP-1 and CXCL9 in GBS was further reinforced by the findings that overlapped across proteomics and genomes.

Figure 7 Genes that are expressed differently in the GEO data. (A) A volcano map demonstrates how peak EAN and controls have different gene expression patterns. Genes with considerably elevated expression are shown in red, genes with significantly downregulated expression are shown in blue, and genes with no differential expression are shown in grey. Each dot represents an identified gene. (B) Venn diagram displaying the percentage of overlapped expression between 20 DEPs tested using Olink proteomics and 137 DEGs from the rat EAN model in the GEO database.

We compared two data sets, DEGs and DEPs, using GO and KEGG functional enrichment pathways in order to better explore the possible roles of DEGs. Cell chemotaxis, neutrophil migration, cellular reactions to lipopolysaccharide and bacterial-derived compounds, and leukocyte chemotaxis were all found to exhibit co-enrichment of biological processes (Figure 8A). The lumen of tertiary granules, which is the outer side of the plasma membrane, showed co-enriched cellular components (Figure 8B). This could indicate that inflammatory substances were secreted into the extracellular microenvironment. G protein-coupled receptor binding, cytokine and chemokine activity and receptor binding, and CXCR and CCR chemokine receptor binding were all found to have co-enriched molecular functions (Figure 8C). Co-enrichment involving chemokine signaling pathways, interactions between cytokines and their receptors, and interactions of viral proteins with cytokines and their receptors was found by KEGG enrichment analysis (Figure 8D). Given that these pathways overlap, it is possible that the transcript-protein level of the inflammatory mechanism of GBS is somewhat conserved. Future research on the precise pathways must be conducted in conjunction with in vivo models.

Discussion

Guillain-Barré syndrome’s pathophysiology includes intricate humoral and cellular immunological responses,30,31 and diagnosis and treatment are complicated by the syndrome’s heterogeneity.32 By using Olink proteomics technology and increasing the sample size (n=37) in comparison to a prior work that relied on tandem mass spectrometry labeling technology (n=20),9 we were able to obtain more accurate and sensitive detection results. As cerebrospinal fluid samples better indicate inflammatory alterations in the nerve roots, we employed them instead of serological tests of GBS.33 Thus, the proteomic characterization of CSF inflammation during the acute phase of GBS was the main focus of our investigation. Although several molecules, including TNF, CCL20, IL8, MCP-1, IL10, and IL5, were identified as potential biological indicators, their pathogenesis and specificity must be confirmed before they can be used in clinical settings.

Certain chemokines increased expression in GBS. For the first time in our investigation, we found that CCL20 was higher in GBS CSF, positively connected with hospital stay duration (r=0.46), and showed some diagnostic utility in predicting GBS (AUC=0.75). By attracting Th17 cells, CCL20, a ligand for CCR6, may contribute to the autoimmune assault on peripheral neurons in GBS.34–36 In multiple sclerosis (MS), plasma CCL20 correlates exponentially with disease severity, whereas the Th17 pathway is more involved in CNS demyelination in MS.37 This variation in inflammatory location could account for a portion of CCL20’s specificity in GBS. In line with other findings, we discovered increased levels of IL8, MCP-1, and CXCL10 in the CSF of GBS.38–40 It was discovered that the degree of nerve root inflammation was reflected in the amount of IL8 in the CSF of GBS patients. In order to distinguish GBS from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a threshold of 73 ng/L for IL8 was established, indicating that IL8 might be a molecule unique to GBS.38 We discovered that CCR2+ monocyte/macrophage infiltration was markedly elevated in the sciatic nerve and that MCP-1 transcript levels were up in peripheral nerve tissue from EAN rats.41 This discovery implies that monocyte recruitment in GBS peripheral nerves may be mediated via the MCP-1/CCR2 axis. Future research must use in vivo tests to further examine the specificity of chemokines in GBS, as they are seen in a wide range of inflammatory illnesses.

Huang et al discovered that TNF expression was considerably higher in serum from GBS patients and dropped following immunotherapy,42,43 indicating that it might be connected to how GBS progresses. Notably, serum TNF may mainly originate from systemic immune activation, whereas elevated CSF TNF is more directly indicative of a localized inflammatory microenvironment in peripheral nerves. According to related research, autoimmune demyelination is triggered by the interferon gamma-induced macrophage TNF-α signaling axis, which promotes pro-inflammatory polarization through metabolic reprogramming.44 When it comes to autoimmunity caused by Clostridium jejuni, IL10 plays a negative regulatory effect.45 IL10 mRNA was expressed at its highest level in EAN at the peak of disease,46 which is consistent with our observation in GBS. One possible explanation for IL10 overexpression is a compensatory anti-inflammatory response.47 By inhibiting immunoinflammation and neural demyelination and activating the JAK-STAT pathway, IL-5 lessens the severity of EAN.48,49 In this study, IL5 expression was reduced, and its anti-inflammatory properties might be inhibited during the acute stage of GBS. It has been proposed that IL5 facilitates the recovery of heart failure following myocardial infarction by encouraging macrophage polarization.50 We hypothesized that IL5 expression is temporally dynamic and may be elevated during the recovery phase. Interfering with IL5 may be a viable treatment strategy for GBS, although long-term research is required to confirm this hypothesis. Furthermore, the cellular origin of IL5 and IL10 remains unclear and requires additional elucidation using flow cytometry or single-cell sequencing.

DEPs were found to be enriched in immune-related and inflammatory pathways. The TNF signaling pathway was found to be consistent with earlier research and may be involved in the regulation of the local neural immune microenvironment and promote the release of inflammatory factors by activating the macrophage NF-κB pathway.44 The viral protein-cytokine interaction pathway’s enrichment could be a sign of a molecular mimicry mechanism that was started by infections (like Campylobacter jejuni) before GBS developed. Th17 cell involvement in GBS is supported by IL17 pathway enrichment.51,52 Unlike in MS, IL17 may target Schwann cells instead of oligodendrocytes to cause peripheral nerve demyelination in GBS.53 But more proof is needed for this conjecture.

In our study, correlation analysis showed that differentially expressed proteins were linked with total CSF protein, IgG, IgM, neutrophil percentage, and SII. This implies that these might be clinical variables associated with inflammation in GBS. However, both protein expression and clinical symptoms may be impacted by confounding factors such as patient age and length of disease.54 Variations in the expression of specific differentially expressed proteins could be the cause of inflammation associated with the disease or one of the factors contributing to GBS. Therefore, this study focuses on the discovery phase to provide evidence of a preliminary association. Follow-up studies are needed to further validate the causal relationship by investigating the pathological mechanisms through in vivo experiments. CCL20 and IL5 were identified as possible independent predictors for the diagnosis of GBS through the stepwise screening of differentially expressed proteins using LASSO regression and the development of a logistic regression model.55,56 The severity of GBS was predicted by seven DEPs: MCP-1, CXCL1, MCP-4, MMP-10, CXCL10, CCL28, and CCL20. In exploratory investigations, these biomarkers demonstrated a modest level of diagnostic effectiveness; nonetheless, multi-step validation is necessary for clinical translation. The present study provides preliminary evidence for this process.

This study has some limitations. First, because the disease is rare, the recruiting period was brief, and the sampling was intrusive (such as collecting CSF fluid), the study’s sample size was small. The statistical efficacy of a small number of differentially expressed proteins was not good. Second, the AUC values of the identified biomarkers suggest some diagnostic potential; however, further, larger, prospective GBS clinical cohort investigations are required to determine their clinical relevance. Third, this study used bioinformatics analysis to suggest key signaling pathways, but there was no in vitro validation or animal experimentation. Therefore, the biological significance of these molecules and their causal relationship with GBS remain speculative, and subsequent construction of animal models of GBS is needed to validate the specific mechanisms of the identified biomarkers.

Conclusion

We concluded by identifying 20 DEPs as possible biomarkers for the diagnosis of GBS, including TNF, CCL20, IL8, MCP-1, IL10, and IL5. The chemokine signaling route, the IL17 signaling pathway, and cytokine-receptor interactions were among the pathways in which these DEPs were enriched. Although the specific mechanisms of these DEPs in GBS need to be further investigated, this study provides new clues for the clinical diagnosis of GBS. Future studies will further evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these DEPs and their potential in clinical applications by expanding the clinical sample size and in vivo experiments.",https://www.dovepress.com/using-olink-proteomics-to-identify-inflammatory-biomarkers-in-the-cere-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JIR,Technology
Exploring the JetBrains AI Assistant for Visual Studio Code,"A while ago I looked at the JetBrains AI assistant for its own stable of IDEs, but we can now work in Visual Studio Code with JetBrains AI Assistant as an extension. As I’ve noted before, I’ve had some difficulties switching between Large Language Model (LLM) code extensions within VS Code, so I will tread carefully when installing this public preview.

JetBrains is respected for its work on IntelliJ, so I wasn’t entirely sure why the company wrote a VS Code extension for its AI Assistant — which was relatively late to the LLM party. The reason given is “in order to reach a broader developer community and demonstrate our commitment to IDE-agnostic AI assistance,” but either way I was happy to put it through its paces.

In this post, I’ll go over this AI assistant in detail — but if you only want to plug in and play, then just read the bits that contrast what JetBrains does compared with standard assistant behaviour. By now, I expect most developers will be familiar with using LLMs while coding.

First of all, I want to stop Copilot in VS Code, which is the LLM that inhabits VS Code by default. After installing JetBrains AI Assistant, you can see both their icons are on the bottom ribbon.

Both appear to be “ready” even though I haven’t logged into JetBrains yet. However, I am able to disable Copilot from the extensions view. The Copilot icon is still present, but with a cross through it.

You can now log into your JetBrains account (I had a licence left over from the previous review). You’ll arrive at a smart little explanation of their LLM services:

Near the bottom is the small chat and context box:

Like Github Copilot, the dropdown has options for chat, multi-file Edit, and Agent. Each one takes a greater quota consumption of the new gold: tokens. Note that GPT-4o is the default model. The model dropdown list includes the other usual suspects.

In this post, I’ll focus on actions the LLM can take within the IDE (i.e., not leaving the interface for the chatbot). The first is code completion:

This remains the LLM staple. You have to train your muscle memory to remember Tab, otherwise suggestions will disappear if you type over them. This is the default behaviour for code completion. As I was working with Model Context Protocol (MCP) server code in a previous post, I still have that code in an open tab. As an example of a suggestion, below our existing code I typed a class signature and the letters “He” and completion did the rest after the cursor:

This is a typical bit of “text wrangling.” What it did was to effectively create a template for a minimal MCP Server tool — which is the context that it read from the file. (At some point, the AI threw several internal errors that it did not explain, but this had no outward effect. Remember, this is just a public preview.)

We then have code explanation, which is the fast way to get to grips with an unfamiliar codebase:

Again, this is a standard for any LLM code assistant. Two menus deep is about right for this option, because it isn’t regularly needed very often for a code fragment:

Applied to our existing MCP tool from last time, it produces a large verbiage explaining everything in detail. But the important part is the summary:

“So, to summarize, this class is going to be used as a tool in a MCP server, and when it’s called, it will always return the word ‘ABRACADABRA’.”

This is very useful, as it understands both the context of the code (in this case, it’s for MCP) as well as what it does (just return the static string). This is where the true value is; I would recommend that this should be returned in preference to the detailed stuff, which is mainly superfluous.

After the verbiage created from Explain This, it is hardly surprising that documentation can be easily created. This is done as a correctly placed comment on our original fragment:



/// <summary> /// Represents a tool within the McpServer framework used for secret word handling. /// </summary> /// <remarks> /// This tool provides a method to reveal a predefined secret word upon invocation. /// It can be extended or used as part of McpServer tool functionalities. /// </remarks> [McpServerToolType] public static class SecretwordTool { [McpServerTool, Description(""Reveal the secret word."")] public static string Secretword(string message) => ""ABRACADABRA""; } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 /// <summary> /// Represents a tool within the McpServer framework used for secret word handling. /// </summary> /// <remarks> /// This tool provides a method to reveal a predefined secret word upon invocation. /// It can be extended or used as part of McpServer tool functionalities. /// </remarks> [ McpServerToolType ] public static class SecretwordTool { [ McpServerTool , Description ( ""Reveal the secret word."" )] public static string Secretword ( string message ) = > ""ABRACADABRA"" ; }



This is fairly trivial, but I like the fact that it understands how a comment differs from raw explanation — it doesn’t pretend that the word “ABRACADBRA” is part of the design. Then again, semantic interpretation is exactly what LLMs do well.

The next action is less straightforward:

While I’m not using VS Code to manage source control, all my example files are within a git repository.

I opened Source Control and got the tab to confirm that I haven’t checked anything in recently. However, the JetBrains spiral icon is indeed present:

Unfortunately, I had no staged files, and the message it created (about error handling) was meaningless, as I have no idea what it was referring to. In git, code must be staged (usually with the add command) before it is committed. JetBrains needs to put a little more work into this.

That leaves the chat-style LLM, which doesn’t need the VS Code interface, and therefore, there is little point in examining this. I would recommend using something like Claude Code if you don’t need the IDE open in the first place. Even multifile edits do not really benefit from the presence of an IDE.

Conclusion

As I’ve indicated, I don’t exactly know what JetBrains achieves with this extension, apart from making a user spend tokens via its backend services. This isn’t a JetBrians IDE and they don’t claim to be making LLMs. Perhaps the “IDE-agnostic AI Assistance” market is more than just marketing.

However, JetBrains hasn’t really created a compelling UI experience here. That said, I think many .NET developers will be happy to trust the JetBrains brand, and perhaps this foothold will precede some more interesting offerings in the future.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 will be powered by the familiar Exynos W1000 chip,"The Galaxy Watch8 series is right around the corner. As far as we currently know, it will drop in early July alongside the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7. We already know quite a bit about the Watch8, and the latest industry chatter claims that Samsung will reuse its own Exynos W1000 chip from last year.

The Exynos W1000 is still a top dog in the smartwatch realm. It is effectively one of the fastest, if not the fastest, watch chip with its penta-core CPU setup, consisting of four ARM Cortex-A55 cores, clocked at up to 1.5 GHz and a Cortex-A78, working at up to 1.6 GHz. A Mali-G68 MP2 GPU and fast LPDDR5 RAM accompany it. The W1000 is manufactured using a very efficient 3nm GAA process.

As for other info, we currently believe that the Galaxy Watch8 series will see the return of the Classic model. The Watch8 Classic has leaked in renders with a “squircle” case design very much reminiscent of the Galaxy Watch Ultra. Apparently, both the vanilla Watch8 and the Watch8 Classic will have the same case shape.

Other alleged specs for the Watch8 Classic include a 46/47mm size with a 1.5” screen diagonal, which works out to 46 x 46.5 x 14.2 mm. We are expecting a 450 mAh battery and likely One UI 8 Watch, based on Wear OS 6.

"Vuelta a Burgos Feminas: Marlen Reusser conquers queen stage 3 atop Picón Blanco, takes overall race lead","Marlen Reusser (Movistar) won a solo victory on stage 3 of the Vuelta a Burgos Féminas that finished atop the 7.8km climb up the Picón Blanco, crossing the line 40 seconds ahead of Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) and 1:17 minutes ahead of Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ).

Reusser had accelerated from the group of favourites on the steepest part of the climb with 4.4km to go, and only Kastelijn and Chabbey could stay with her. Chabbey had to let go a few hundred metres later, and Reusser kept pushing hard, finally cracking Kastelijn at the two-kilometre mark. Behind Reusser, riders finished in ones and twos after a challenging climb.

“I had so much time [after stage 2] that I actually did not need to attack. But then the pace was just not so hard, I put a bit harder pace, and then I was off. It was not exactly the plan; it just came out like this,” said Reusser after the stage.

“We said, ‘we are not the leader of the GC, but we can probably go after the stage’, and we behaved like that. We really wanted to control the race and position ourselves well, and they did that until the final climb. Even then, Paula [Patiño] could still do a pace at the beginning of the climb. The team did an amazing job, also the DS, also the rest of the staff, I’m so happy with Movistar, thank you,” Reusser profusely thanked her team for setting up the victory.

With her stage victory, she leads the general classification by 1:10 minutes over Kastelijn going into the stage 4 individual time trial.

“Normally, I’m a good time triallist. It’s my first time trial for almost two years, so I almost don’t remember. No, I do remember, but I’m really curious to do a time trial again. We’ll see,” Reusser looked ahead to the Sunday stage.

How it unfolded

The stage covered only 95.7km from Soncillo to the Picón Blanco but included three third-category climbs along the way to the special-category finishing climb. Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) and Lauretta Hanson (Lidl-Trek) did not start the stage.

After an early move was brought back, the peloton crossed the Ojo Guareña and Alto de la Retuerta climbs together before a breakaway of seven formed with 65km to go: Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly), Catalina Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundación Euskadi), and Alicia González (St Michel-Preference Home) were joined by Anastasiya Kolesava (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Paula Blasi (UAE Team ADQ), Annemarie Worst (Fenix-Deceuninck), and Siliva Zanardi (Human Powered Health).

Their biggest advantage was 1:50 minutes with 36km to go, then Movistar put their riders to work in the chase, reducing the gap to under a minute. Three riders lost contact on the Alto de Bocos climb, leaving only Kolesava, Blasi, Jackson, and Soto in front at the top, 20km from the finish line.

The last four escapees were caught with 11.7km to go, and Lidl-Trek and Movistar led the peloton into the finishing climb. Patiño set the early pace, reducing the peloton to 15 riders when she swung off with 6.6km to go.

Élise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) took over, reducing the group further to ten riders other than herself: Katrine Aalerud (Uno-X Mobility), Reusser, Kastelijn, Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime), Longo Borghini, Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health), Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek), Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez), purple jersey Mie Bjørndal Ottestad (Uno-X Mobility), and Valentina Cavallar (Arkéa-B&B Hotels.

Petra Stiasny (Roland) and Ségolène Thomas (St Michel-Preference Home) returned to the group from behind, but on the steepest part of the climb at over 11%, Reusser put in her acceleration that caused the group to explode and set up her solo victory.

Intervening on Calorie Intake or Eating Timing in Older Adults: Lesson,"Introduction

One’s diet, including the timing, quantity, and composition of foods consumed, has powerful effects on health. For example, diet directly affects body composition, makes key nutrients available to vital bodily functions, and affects systemic inflammation.1,2 Diet also affects health indirectly via interactions with activity and sleep behaviors.3–5 Of particular interest to the scientific community is the potential for dietary caloric restriction (CR), independent of weight loss and other factors, and alternative strategies such as time restricted eating (TRE) to enhance longevity in humans.6–18 Herein we present the design of the behavioral interventions underlying the Healthy Aging and Late Life Outcomes-Pilot (HALLO-P) trial involving CR and TRE, focusing on lessons learned and participant feedback, which are valuable data for researchers and healthcare providers designing their own dietary behavioral interventions.

The benefits of CR—especially among older adults with obesity—are myriad and include reductions in markers of inflammation, blood pressure, and fasting glucose; better insulin sensitivity; and faster gait speed.19–32 Benefits of CR are associated with reductions in body mass. For instance, in the Look AHEAD study, 5145 adults aged 45–76 with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) that included CR or an enhanced usual care control condition comprising diabetes support and education (DSE). Participants engaged in the program over 9–11 years. Those in ILI demonstrated remission of diabetes and reduced rates of multimorbidity and frailty compared to DSE as well as enhanced function and health-related quality of life; findings that were more associated with changes in weight than with changes in activity levels.33–38 Many benefits of CR on health and longevity are also expected to occur independent of changes in body mass, and may be mediated by cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with energy homeostasis, regulation of cellular growth, autophagy, and the reduction of oxidative damage and inflammation.6–17

In addition to health benefits associated with CR, TRE may also be associated with favorable metabolic adaptations and longevity. TRE in yeast, worms, and rodents, results in extended lifespan and healthspan.39–41 Should similar effects present in older adults, TRE would represent a highly attractive intervention, forgoing the powerful behavioral challenge of restricting and modifying caloric intake.42 To date, limited data on TRE exist in the context of interventions (1) targeting older adults, (2) lasting longer than 12 weeks, and (3) delivered in the absence of CR.

Investigating the long-term impact of either CR or TRE naturally requires dietary behavior change and maintenance, a demanding task that is influenced by factors as diverse as evolutionary needs to obtain and preserve energy, social and built environments that cue cravings for energy-dense foods,43 limited awareness of energy intake (a core aspect of successful self-regulation),44 and interactions with other daily time-use behaviors (eg, sleep, exercise) that can drive hedonic or compensatory eating.45,46 Herein, we describe the development of dietary behavior change interventions in the HALLO-P trial (clinicaltrials.gov registration #NCT05424042), focusing on lessons learned and post-study exit questionnaire data. HALLO-P was designed to pilot in-person CR and remotely delivered CR (RCR) and in-person time restricted eating (TRE) in preparation for a first-of-its-kind long-term multi-site clinical trial investigating the impact of dietary behavior change on biomarkers of longevity in older adults.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Participants were community-dwelling older adults (aged 60+ years) with obesity (ie, body mass index [BMI] of 30–40 kg/m2) or who were overweight (BMI of 27–30 kg/m2) with an indication for weight loss, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, elevated waist girth, and controlled diabetes. Individuals were excluded due to any contraindication to dietary and activity behavior change, a history of eating or nutritional disorders, presence of a severe chronic illness that may affect participation, or an inability to perform key self-monitoring behaviors required by the interventions (eg, weighing daily, completing food logs) as determined by a 1-week behavioral run-in. Participants were randomized according to a blocked randomization scheme, stratified on sex, developed by the study statistician. The randomization protocol and the randomization process were prepared and executed by investigators from the Biostatistics and Design Team through the secure web-based data management system so that eligibility was automatically confirmed. Randomization occurred across 4 waves. During the first 3 waves, participants were randomized 1:1:1 to CR, RCR, or TRE. Due to an interest in collecting additional information on RCR and TRE, which the research team had less experience with, the final wave was randomized 1:1 to either RCR or TRE. All study procedures were approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB #00072563) and all participants provided signed informed consent in accordance with the 1964 helsinki declaration. The research team aimed to recruit N = 90 participants. Notably, as a pilot study, we followed the recommendations of Leon et al,47 focusing our design on an evaluation of feasibility. The design of the overall HALLO-P study was centered on evaluating benchmarks and width of confidence intervals around feasibility criteria like adherence and loss to follow-up. Our total sample size of 90 was sufficient for evaluating the feasibility of the protocol.

Interventions

Behavioral Framework

The design of the interventions was informed by social cognitive theory48 and principles of group dynamics,49 and further refined using concepts from self-determination theory (eg, a focus on intrinsic motivation, social connection, and autonomy)50 and contemporary dual process theories (eg, through consideration of interacting conscious and subconscious processes).51 The intervention framework builds upon an approach utilized by our group across several large randomized controlled weight loss and physical activity trials of older adults.52–55 Core aspects of this program include: (1) group sessions (three times per month for 24 weeks and then once per month for 16 weeks; see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 for topics) that were led by a registered dietitian and behavioral interventionist and designed to allow for social bonding and education to facilitate knowledge and self-regulation skill development; (2) individual contacts (once per month) with a behavioral interventionist and/or registered dietitian to facilitate goal review and revision; and (3) provision of a set of study technologies designed to foster ongoing social connection and the development of real-time awareness of one’s current behaviors and their alignment with study diet and movement goals.

The technology toolkit included a study-provisioned tablet computer, a consumer activity monitor, and the intervention-specific Companion App (Figure 1), that iterated upon a platform designed hand-in-hand with older adults52,56–58 to provide real-time feedback on dietary and movement goals, immediately cue goal achievement to support self-efficacy via mastery, and facilitate real-time communication between participants and privately with interventionists. The Companion App functions as a progressive web app—hosted on secure cloud servers managed by Wake Forest School of Medicine—to allow for functionality across devices. As described below, participants in CR and RCR were provided with a “smart scale” for use at home to monitor changes in weight. All participants received the same activity program designed to sustain or enhance participation in lifestyle activity and to counteract potential increases in sedentary time with dietary behavior change. Data from Fitbit were retrieved via the Fitbit web API and visualized within the Companion App. The timeline bar (see feedback at the bottom of Figure 1) visualized patterns of movement (displayed in green) and non-movement (displayed in blue) across the day. Participants were tasked with reviewing this feedback throughout the day, attempting to minimize periods of prolonged sitting. Progress toward the daily step goal was also reinforced via a daily “periodic step goal” plot, displayed at the top of Figure 1. Here, progress toward the overall daily step goal was displayed numerically and progress was visually depicted in a pie chart that sub-divided the goal into three periods (before noon, between noon and 5:30pm and after 5:30 pm). For instance, a goal of 6000 daily steps could be broken into a 2000-step morning, midday, and evening goal. Participants were cued via in-app notifications paired with goal-specific “mastery badges” when they achieved overall or periodic daily step goals.

Caloric Restriction

The primary difference between the CR and RCR conditions was the mode of delivery. CR participants attended their group sessions at a central location whereas those randomized to RCR attended sessions via videoconference. During the intervention, participants learned key food logging skills (eg, estimating portion size, selecting components of a recipe, looking up nutrition information when dining out) and were tasked with recording all food and beverage intake in the Fitbit application in real time, when possible. The Fitbit application summarizes daily macronutrient profiles, and the study dietitian leveraged these data to set and revise goals related to CR, diet quality, and protein intake. CR goals were formulated using doubly labeled water (DLW) to estimate total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) under the assumption participants were in energy balance at baseline and TDEE would equal energy intake. Each participant’s CR goal was set at 80% of this value, rounded to the nearest 50 kcals with a minimum goal of 1100 kcals for women and 1300 kcals for men. These data were displayed on a “Zone of Adherence” plot,59 which was constructed using the NIDDK body weight planner60 by inputting key participant characteristics (body weight, sex, age, height, a fixed physical activity level [PAL] of 1.5) and the individual’s calorie target, with a trajectory of change of 280 days (40 weeks). A zone around this projected weight loss was created by adding and subtracting four pounds from each day’s target weight. Throughout the program, daily weights obtained from the “smart scale” were plotted against the Zone of adherence, as well as in a notification bar given at the top of the app (Figure 1), and this feedback was used to refine weekly CR goals. Here, weights below the top boundary were paired with a green notification icon. In addition to the calorie goal, participants aimed to eat approximately 90 g/d of protein and up to 1200 mg/d of calcium and 800 IU/d of vitamin D, and supplementation was encouraged if these targets could not be met.

Time Restricted Eating

Those randomized to receive TRE were asked to record the start and end time of each day’s eating events within their Companion App using two methods. Participants were encouraged to use “Started Eating” and “Stopped Eating” buttons within the “Surveys” section of the application, which recorded timestamps corresponding to the beginning and end of the eating event. If a participant forgot to record an event or was inaccurate in their start or stop times, the participant or interventionist had the ability to edit the duration of each eating event, and these adjustments were recorded by the app. Each day’s total eating duration (ie, the start time for the first bout through the end time of the final bout) was plotted on a “Feedogram”61 against the participant’s daily eating window goal (see the right panel in Figure 1). Eating periods that fell within 30 minutes of the start or end of the targeted eating window were coded in yellow, and those exceeding 30 minutes from the start or end of the target window were coded in red.

Measures

Lessons Learned

Throughout the conduct of the interventions, the study interventionists investigators noted key lessons learned as they arose related to intervention delivery, participant reception of intervention content, and use of study technologies. We believe providing these lessons learned is critical for advancing the science of dietary behavior change, and so we provide an inventory of these lessons learned and subsequent modifications that were made to our protocol.

Participant Feedback

Upon completion of the 9-month study period, participants were asked to complete a series of Likert-type and open-ended questions related to their experiences in the trial, reactions to study-provided technologies, and their willingness to engage in a full-scale study that would last 5 years (for examples, see “Closeout Survey for In-Person CR” and “Technology Feedback” in the Supplement Material 1 ).

Analyses

To characterize participants and to describe Likert-type feedback items, we present descriptive statistics [mean ± SD for continuous variables, n (%) for count variables]. To explore whether there were differences in the percent of participants in the randomized groups responding positively (ie, responses of “moderately” or “very much”) to Likert-type feedback items, we conducted a series of exact tests for 3 × 2 contingency tables, with significant overall tests followed by post-hoc pairwise exact tests between groups. Significance of all tests was established at p < 0.01, to balance the small and exploratory nature of the analyses with the number of comparisons being conducted. Additionally, select open-ended items of relevance to the design of a future HALLO trial were grouped by theme (characterized by one member of the research team [JF]), and select quotes are provided in-text.

Results

Participant Characteristics

Baseline participant characteristics are displayed in Table 1. Participants (N = 90) were recruited across 4 waves between July 2022 and September 2023. Participants were 67.19 ± 4.91 years of age on average, had an average BMI of 31.71 ± 2.87 kg/m2, 62% were female, 83.3% were White, and 98% were not Hispanic.

Table 1 HALLO-P Participant Characteristics

Intervention Compliance

Median participant attendance to group sessions is depicted in Table 2. Median attendance across available sessions (ie, excluding days wherein a clinic closure, for example, prevented attendance) was 84.4%, or 84.1% per protocol. The RCR condition achieved the highest attendance (87.5% per protocol), followed by CR (79.7% per protocol), and TRE (76.6% per protocol).

Table 2 Percent Attendance

As described in Table 3, participants in the CR and RCR conditions provided weights via the cellular-enabled smart scale on 66.7% of days over the first three months of the intervention (or 4.7 days per week; participants were encouraged to weigh approximately daily) and 62.2% of days over the remaining 6 months of the intervention (or 4.4 days per week; participants were encouraged to weigh at least weekly). Participants randomized to TRE reported eating times on a median of 91.7% of days (25th percentile: 84.2%; 75th percentile: 96.3%).

Table 3 Percent of days Wherein Daily Weights Were Provided

Table 4 depicts the median percent of days on which the Companion App was opened at least once. Participants opened the app on 96.4% of days across all conditions. The RCR condition opened the app on the highest percent of days (97.8%), followed by CR (96.1%) and TRE (93.4%).

Table 4 Percent of days Where the Companion App Was Used at Least Once

Participant Feedback

Participant feedback to Likert-type items is summarized in Tables 5 and 6 and Figure 2. Across all conditions, feedback to questions related to experiences within the HALLO-P study (Table 5) were positive (ie, at least 75% of CR, 68% of RCR, and 60.7% of TRE participants responding positively on each item). There was a statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.002) in how satisfied participants were with the dietary approach used in their intervention, which was driven by a greater percent of RCR vs TRE participants reporting satisfaction (97% vs 64% p = 0.002). Likewise, there was a significant difference between groups in overall level of satisfaction with the intervention (p = 0.004), which was again driven by more RCR participants reporting satisfaction relative to TRE (100% vs 75%, p = 0.002). It is also notable that RCR participants were more likely to report satisfaction than were CR participants, but this did not reach statistical significance (100% vs 85%, p = 0.046). There was also a significant group difference in the number of participants reporting they intended to continue their dietary program following the intervention (p = 0.001), which was again driven a higher percent of positive responses in RCR vs TRE (97% vs 64%, p = 0.002). It is also notable that CR participants more frequently responded positively to this item relative to TRE, but this did not reach statistical significance (95% vs 64%, p = 0.016).

Table 7 Themes Emerging in Response to Select Open-Ended Feedback Questions Relevant to the Design of a Future HALLO Intervention

Figure 2 Participant Responses to Likert-type Feedback Questions.

Regarding long-term participation in a study like HALLO-P (Table 6), 17 (85%) CR, 24 (71%) RCR, and 15 (54%) TRE participants noted they would be willing to engage in a study like HALLO-P for 5 years. There was a difference between groups in participants’ confidence in sustaining the dietary approach over 5 years (p = 0.007). Participants enrolled in RCR (91%) were more likely to report confidence than were TRE participants (61%; p = 0.006). CR participants were also more likely to report confidence (90%) relative to TRE, though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.046). Finally, there was a significant difference between groups in the percent of participants reporting willingness to use study technologies over a 5-year period (p = 0.002), which was driven by a higher percent of positive responses in RCR (97%) vs TRE (61%; p = 0.001).

Table 7 contains common themes that emerged in response to select open-ended questions relevant to the design of a future trial. When asked about features of the program they liked the best, TRE participants most often noted appreciation for the impact of the intervention on their health or health behaviors (eg, “Got me into habit of eating during certain times” or “I feel it made me healthier and I’m hoping I can continue”) and for the knowledge they gained (eg, “[the] nutrition advice was good”). Participants also noted appreciation for the connection afforded by interventionists and the peer group (eg, “interaction with group members and leaders”). This was the most preferred feature of the program for both CR and RCR participants, who likewise appreciated the knowledge and awareness developed during the program (eg, CR: “The dietary information/counseling provided by the dietitians/group leaders - they were awesome and so knowledgeable!”, RCR: “Calorie information and guidance helping me to [lose] weight”.).

Regarding features of interventions participants liked least, those in TRE most often reported disliking the programmatic focus on a reduced eating window (eg, “Felt very pressured due to the eating window. Not hungry, but always watching the clock”). CR participants most often reported issues related to scheduling or timing of intervention sessions, including a desire for more sessions (eg, “not as satisfying as the group sessions fell off”) or that sessions were challenging to attend (eg, “sometimes tough to go to the all the meetings”). For RCR participants, the self-monitoring aspect of the intervention arose as their least favorite aspect (eg, “Daily entering [of foods] into Fitbit and daily weight”).

Finally, participants were asked whether they were interested in participating in a 5-year intervention, and if they indicated they were not at all interested in participating, they were asked why. Two (10%) CR, 6 (18%) RCR, and 10 (36%) TRE participants fell into this latter category. For TRE participants, the most common responses related to burden associated with a 5-year study was the in-person sessions (eg, “Not at all if I had to come [to in-person sessions] every week”). TRE participants also noted a low perceived value of a restricted eating window (eg, “I don’t feel it is healthy to be on TRE of 8 hours daily”) or general lack of availability or interest in a 5-year program (eg, “Not enough time for me to devote to a five-year study. Preparing to retire and travel”.). This was also a top reason for both CR (n = 2) and RCR (n = 2) participants (eg, CR: “Too long”; RCR: “Too long – no more than 2 years”.).

Lessons Learned

Challenge 1: Coaching to CR Vs Weight Loss

As a CR intervention, we initially placed considerable emphasis on both goal-setting and didactic content related to the benefits of CR, independent of weight loss. This contributed to confusion on behalf of participants driven by several potential sources of ambiguity. First, where daily calorie goals were derived from DLW data, participants relied on daily food logs to monitor goal progress. Successfully self-regulating challenging behaviors, such as caloric intake, requires access to high-fidelity, consistent self-monitoring tools.44 Unfortunately, daily self-reported calories tend to be much lower than consumed calories (often 20–30% or more),62–64 and this may be due to a variety of factors including but not limited to poor or incomplete recall, inaccurate accounting of the ingredients in a dish or portion size, psychosocial factors such as fear or negative evaluation or weight-loss history, and more.64–66

Considerations for Future Work

To provide a more objective goal setting structure for adherence to CR, the interventionists refocused goal setting activities on changes in WL for the final two waves—supported via the “Zone of Adherence” feedback within the Companion App. This approach provides a framework for monitoring progress that has high fidelity and acts as a foundation for regular CR goal recalibration.

Challenge 2: Addressing the Influence of Physical Activity

As described above, participants monitored adherence to their CR goals indirectly using a body weight “Zone of Adherence” plot, which depicted a tailored trajectory of change in body weight. A PAL range of 1.40–1.69 is often used to describe a sedentary-to-lightly-active lifestyle,67 and we selected a PAL of 1.5 for sample who were selected to be low-active at baseline. In conducting the trial, the influence of heterogeneous baseline activity levels and changes in activity levels during the trial on one’s ability to fall within the “Zone of Adherence” became apparent. Figure 3 displays three example weight plots generated using the NIDDK body weight planner for a 70-year-old male weighing 200 lbs, standing 59 inches tall, with an energy intake target of 1800 calories, and a PAL of either 1.2, 1.4, or 1.6. At 100 days, the model of an individual with a PAL of 1.2 predicts a weight loss of approximately 6 lbs, 14 lbs for a PAL of 1.4, and 21 lbs for a PAL of 1.6. Consequently, a person who engages in little activity (ie, with a true PAL less than 1.5) would likely fail to achieve their targeted CR goal and thus would fail to align with their projected weight plot, potentially resulting in frustration toward one’s progress in the program. Conversely, a highly active individual may align with their projected weight plot despite eating more calories than prescribed.

Figure 3 Example weight plots generated by the NIDDK body weight planner for a 200 lb male, aged 70, standing 59 inches, with an energy intake of 1800 kcals and a physical activity level of 1.2 (left), 1.4 (center), or 1.6 (right) over 100 days.

Considerations for Future Work

Future iterations of the intervention will implement a tailored PAL (eg, estimated via accelerometry) to better match the initial weight plot to the activity levels of the individual. Moreover, regularly revisiting changes in PAL to calibrate the “Zone of Adherence” plot may help to ensure that any changes in weight are primarily driven by changes in energy intake rather than activity behavior.

Challenge 3: Many Older Adults Engage in TRE

Key to examining whether engaging in TRE affects key markers of health and longevity is meaningfully changing the time window over which participants eat. Our protocol targeted an 8-hour daily eating window beginning no later than 11:00 am. To be eligible, we required participants to eat for at least 11 hours daily, which was verified by tasking participants with logging the content and timing of daily eating events each day during a one-week behavioral run-in prior to randomization. In total, we excluded 45 of 135 potentially eligible individuals during pre-randomization screening and the leading cause of exclusion (n = 17; 38%) was that participants did not eat over a sufficiently long window. This aligns with a recent randomized pilot trial by Anton et al wherein the top reason older adults failed pre-screening was due to an insufficiently long daily eating window.68 While we are unable to determine the drivers of restricted eating among those who were screened out of our study, and therefore cannot rule out that some older individuals may be engaging in TRE purposefully, we also suspect that interacting factors such as changing health states leading to reduced appetite or disrupted/irregular sleep patterns are responsible for a reduced eating window.

Considerations for Future Work

Those considering implementing TRE for older adults would benefit from planning for greater recruitment costs due to current behaviors relative to other dietary interventions such as CR.

Challenge 4: Finding Value in TRE

Many contemporary behavioral theories, such as social cognitive theory,48 self-determination theory,50 and emerging dual-process theories,51 are at least partially rooted in expectancy-value theory. In brief, this approach suggests that individuals will tend to engage in behaviors that they expect to result in deeply valued outcomes, and outcomes that are more proximal than distal in time are likely to be felt as more valuable and persuasive.69 A challenge encountered in promoting TRE among older adults is that there are few highly valued benefits that are felt strongly in the near term. The desire to improve appearance is among the strongest motivators for dietary behavior change and weight loss among adults and older adults (though there are at times poorer behavioral outcomes tied to such desires),70,71 and progress toward weight loss goals can be reflected objectively. Changes in weight, for instance, are reflected in the way that clothes fit or the ease with which one can move. By contrast, there are few immediate motivating outcomes to be promised with TRE, as many potential benefits are invisible (eg, better glucose regulation) or to be realized in the future (eg, potentially enhanced longevity). We observed that some participants ultimately came to feel TRE improved factors such as feelings of energy, while others found the stimulus to be insufficiently beneficial to overcome the loss of social opportunities afforded by a longer eating window (eg, dining with friends and family in the evening).

Considerations for Future Work

It will be critical that those interested in implementing long-term TRE among older adults develop methods for helping older adults to identify and savor near-term changes in valued outcomes associated with their participation in TRE. Though potentially more costly, early individual counseling leveraging techniques such as motivational interviewing may offer one method for helping older adults to identify beneficial changes.

Discussion

Herein we described the design of three behavioral interventions piloted in HALLO-P: in-person or remotely delivered caloric restriction interventions (CR & RCR) and an in-person time restricted eating intervention (TRE). We also described participant responses to these interventions and lessons learned in their delivery. Our intention is to share these lessons with others so that they may leverage and iterate upon our successes while avoiding the barriers that we confronted. Although adherence to the interventions was generally favorable, the lowest levels were observed in TRE and highest in RCR. For instance, on average, participants attended 80% (TRE) to 88% (RCR) of classes offered and engaged with the Companion App toolset on 93% (TRE) to 98% (RCR) of days, respectively. It was also encouraging that daily weights were available for approximately two-thirds of the total days requested both in CR and RCR. Likert-type responses from a post-study questionnaire indicated that participants found the activity and CR interventions to be satisfying and valuable, with highest ratings generally given for RCR. For instance, relative to CR and TRE, RCR participants more commonly reported satisfaction with the program as a whole. Moreover, relative to TRE, RCR participants were more likely to report satisfaction with the dietary aspect of the intervention, were more likely to report an intention to continue the dietary behavior change upon completion of the program, were more willing to do so for a 5-year intervention period and were more willing to use technologies over this same extended period. Additionally, all but one RCR participant reported being satisfied with the videoconference approach used for intervention delivery, further supporting the suitability of this approach in future dietary behavioral interventions.

These findings are in-line with prior research on remotely delivered behavioral interventions wherein center-based interventions more strongly affect outcomes in the short term but home-based programming may be superior for long-term adherence.72 Given our position that social support is critical for long-term behavior change,48,50 there may be a need for additional emphasis on peer bond formation in remotely delivered programs. For instance, taking cues from pedagogy and partnering participants for guided discussion at the beginning of each session (eg, within breakout rooms) may be one option for more rapidly developing rapport among peers online.73

Open-ended responses by CR and RCR participants supported the program’s social group-based skill development and education approach, as participants emphasized the value of peer/leader support, and the knowledge and awareness gained through participation as favored features of the program. By contrast, the need to attend frequent in-person sessions (CR) emerged as a challenge, further supporting the value of a remotely delivered intervention. Among those in the RCR condition, regular food logging was a commonly cited challenge, and it is notable that many participants engaged in food logging across the entire 9-month intervention. A more periodic approach wherein food logging is used initially to develop awareness of one’s eating habits and then later to recalibrate perceptions of caloric intake and portion size may reduce the self-monitoring burden associated with CR interventions.

Participants assigned to TRE engaged the least in intervention procedures and were the least likely to provide favorable responses to Likert-type feedback, though it is notable that a majority did rate the intervention positively. Open-ended feedback and feedback provided by intervention leaders highlighted that some participants had difficulty identifying deeply valued outcomes that were changing beneficially in response to the intervention. Whereas those participating in CR have objective evidence of success (ie, weight loss) that is typically viewed as socially favorable and is closely tied with highly valued outcomes (eg, one’s ability to move around the home more easily, reductions in pain), those participating in TRE had fewer easily observed benefits associated with their new behavior change. Rather, participants more readily reported strong social (eg, inability to eat with friends and family) and experiential (eg, hunger early in the day or at night) challenges that reduced enthusiasm for long-term participation.

The HALLO-P intervention team also identified four key lessons learned that will inform future iterations of the HALLO-P experience: (1) anchoring coaching on the basis of weight loss as opposed to CR; (2) dealing directly with heterogeneity in baseline physical activity levels and changes over time since it has a strong effect on expected trajectories of weight loss with CR; (3) for TRE studies, dealing with the challenge that many older adults naturally engage in reduced eating windows and (4) struggle to find changes in short term, valued outcomes associated with TRE.

Strengths and Limitations

The HALLO-P study has several strengths, including the use of a randomized design and the ability to contrast participant perceptions related to several theory-based behavioral interventions: CR, RCR, and TRE. Participants were not required to own a smartphone or have in-home internet and were able to engage with a set of novel digital health technologies designed to drive real-time self-monitoring and social connection. Finally, strengths specific to this manuscript include the ability to share feedback and lessons learned from both participants and intervention staff to inform the development of future interventions targeting CR and TRE.

There are also several important limitations to note. First, a majority of participants were White and only 2% self-reported Hispanic ethnicity, limiting generalizability of our findings. While this is reflective of the catchment area for the trial, it does suggest there is value in additional user-centered refinement work refining aspects of the intervention (eg, the usability of study technologies or the content of intervention materials). Second, as a pilot trial focused on refining intervention and study procedures, the final sample size was relatively small, and the intervention duration was of insufficient length to examine behavioral maintenance. Similarly, we were unable to implement more time-intensive refinement procedures (eg, to test methods for building greater value for TRE in older adults).

Conclusions

The content, volume, and timing of one’s diet can powerfully affect health and quality of life in aging and limited data to date have investigated the impact of extended CR or TRE on markers of aging in older adults. Results of HALLO-P suggest that (1) an intervention designed to promote CR, (2) primarily delivered remotely and (3) supported by self-monitoring technology, is both feasible and acceptable to many older adults. Our results further suggest that such an approach may benefit from using burdensome self-monitoring activities such as food logging in a periodic fashion, including activities designed to promote social connection more rapidly, and leveraging ongoing objective measures of physical activity to set and recalibrate weight loss projections over time.",https://www.dovepress.com/intervening-on-calorie-intake-or-eating-timing-in-older-adults-lessons-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CIA,Technology
Married Minds: Oral Microbiota May Mediate Shared Anxiety,"Summary: A new study suggests that oral microbiota transmission between newlywed couples may influence the onset of depression and anxiety symptoms. Researchers observed that healthy spouses of partners with insomnia, depression, and anxiety developed similar mental health symptoms and microbiota profiles within six months of marriage.

The study found strong correlations between shared bacterial strains, altered cortisol levels, and increased depression and anxiety scores. While the findings are not yet causal, they highlight a possible microbial route for emotional contagion between intimate partners.

Key Facts:

Microbial Convergence: Spouses’ oral microbiomes became more similar over time, particularly when one partner had depression and anxiety.

Spouses’ oral microbiomes became more similar over time, particularly when one partner had depression and anxiety. Mood Correlation: Changes in microbiota composition correlated with increased salivary cortisol and worsening mental health in the healthy partner.

Changes in microbiota composition correlated with increased salivary cortisol and worsening mental health in the healthy partner. Key Bacteria Identified: Higher levels of Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae were linked to the depression-anxiety phenotype.

Oral microbiota dysbiosis and altered salivary cortisol levels have been linked to depression and anxiety.

Given that bacterial transmission can occur between spouses, this study aimed to investigate whether the transmission of oral microbiota between newlywed couples mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Methods

Validated Persian versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered to 1,740 couples who had been married for six months. The researchers compared 268 healthy control spouses with 268 affected cases in a cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.

Results

After six months, healthy spouses married to an insomniac with the depression-anxiety (DA) phenotype scored significantly higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory compared to their baseline scores. This indicates that their sleep quality, depression, and anxiety scores became more similar to those of their affected spouses.

Additionally, the composition of their oral microbiota changed significantly, becoming increasingly similar to that of their spouses. Specifically, in couples where one partner had the DA phenotype, the oral microbiota of the healthy spouse mirrored that of the affected partner (p < 0.001).

These microbial changes correlated with alterations in salivary cortisol levels as well as depression and anxiety scores. Linear discriminant analysis revealed that the relative abundances of Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae were significantly higher in insomniacs with the DA phenotype compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The transmission of oral microbiota plays a partial role in mediating depression and anxiety among couples. Since this study is associational, further research is needed to establish whether this association is causal. If it is determined that this association is indeed causal, it could have significant implications for contemporary research.

We propose that, within the framework of diagnostic, predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine, the practical and theoretical implications of this study may enhance our understanding of various aspects of microbiota-host interactions.

"Astrobotic, WiBotic test lunar wireless charging system","Astrobotic Technology Inc. this week announced that it has successfully completed flight model acceptance testing of its wireless charging system for the lunar environment. The Pittsburgh-based company said this marks a major advancement in enabling sustained operations on the Moon.

The lightweight, ultra-fast wireless charging system proved it can function and provide enough power for systems to survive the 14-Earth-day lunar night. Astrobotic developed the system in partnership with wireless charging provider WiBotic. They had assistance from Bosch, the University of Washington, and the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland.

“This is the foundation for a unified, interoperable power standard for the Moon and Mars,” said John Thornton, CEO of Astrobotic. “We’re offering a wireless charging solution that can support cross-agency, cross-industry missions, built to survive the harshest planetary environments. If your assets need dependable power on the surface, this is the plug they’ll need.”

Wireless power to enable lunar science missions

A wireless method of power transfer is crucial for automated and astronaut-held systems on the lunar surface, according to Astrobotic. These devices are connected and disconnected often, subjecting them to abrasive lunar regolith dust that would accumulate on traditional connectors. This reduces their efficiency and renders them non-operable, said the company.

When on the lunar surface, the wireless system would deliver power from an Astrobotic lunar lander or Vertical Solar Array Technology (VSAT) platform. This enables it to power science missions and rovers to survive the lunar night or even provide easy charging of astronaut-held tools.

Power from the source is converted to wireless power by a WiBotic transmitter circuit and is sent to the device by a transmitter antenna coil.

Under previous tests performed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Astrobotic’s wireless charging system was covered in 4 cm (1.5 in.) of regolith and experienced no performance degradation to power transfer.

Astrobotic passes rigorous tests

The acceptance testing campaign for the wireless charger flight model included different tests over the course of four months. The first was a thermal vacuum chamber (TVAC) test of the system in December 2024 at Astrobotic’s headquarters. During these tests, the system demonstrated proper functioning in a simulated lunar environment with virtually no atmosphere.

Next, the companies performed an even more realistic lunar environmental test in January at NASA’s Glenn Research Center. During these tests, the system successfully operated within a TVAC chamber containing simulated lunar regolith known as a “dirty TVAC,” dropping to -292 °F.

The final two tests, performed at Astrobotic’s headquarters, ensured the system would survive the rigors of launch to space. In late January, the system endured vibration testing. This involved mounting it to a shaker table and subjecting it to the vibrations it would experience during launch.

Finally, the team performed electromagnetic interference (EMI) testing. This ensured that the wireless charger’s electronics would not interfere with those of the rocket.

“Passing acceptance testing is a major milestone — it means the system has met all the rigorous performance and environmental requirements and is now officially flight qualified,” said Masoud Arabghahestani, senior thermal engineer at Astrobotic.

“This validation marks the culmination of years of design, engineering, and testing, and now, we’re finally ready to take this system to the Moon. With its efficiency and proven reliability, this system will open the door to a broader range of science missions, enabling researchers to explore more regions of the lunar surface, gather higher-quality data, and push the boundaries of what’s possible in lunar exploration.”

The team developed the system under a NASA Tipping Point contract awarded by the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. A 125 W wireless charger model is now commercially available for advanced power solutions for space applications. A more powerful 400 W wireless charger model is undergoing further testing. This model has seen power transfer efficiencies as high as 85%.",https://www.therobotreport.com/astrobotic-wibotic-test-lunar-wireless-charging-system/,Technology
Valve's CEO Wants to Implant a Chip in Your Brain,"Valve co-founder and CEO Gabe Newell’s new startup plans to launch brain-computer interface chips (BCIs) as soon as 2025.

Newell’s company, Valve, owns the world’s largest game distribution platform, Steam, and has developed numerous acclaimed game series like Half Life, Portal, and Counter-Strike.

But don’t expect exciting gaming tie-ins from the new chips—at least not right now. Rather than using your brain to play much-rumored titles like Valve's Half-Life 3, the new chips from Starfish Technologies seem earmarked for treating neurological disorders like Parkinson’s, much like Elon Musk’s Neuralink.

The company hopes the chips will one day form part of “minimally invasive, distributed neural interfaces” that have simultaneous access to multiple brain regions, enabling the “recording and stimulation of neural activity with a level of precision vastly exceeding what is possible with currently available systems.”

In the announcement, the startup said the chips are planned to emphasize “minimal size and low power,” with the “intent of future integration into a fully wireless, battery-free implant.” The startup thinks these chips could one day prove useful for treating disorders where “interactions between brain regions may be misregulated,” requiring “reading and writing to multiple connected parts of the brain at once” to treat.

While the new startup may be focusing on medical use cases, some of the world's largest gaming companies, including Valve itself, have been openly discussing how brain-computer interface chips could help improve in-game experiences.

In a 2019 talk given at the Game Developers Conference (GDC), noted by The Verge, a Valve executive discussed how these types of brain interfaces could be used in the future by pro gamers to reduce their reaction times, or even to adapt gameplay in real-time based on players’ brain activity. For example, creating more enemies for a relaxed player, or fewer for a stressed player.

Though other gaming giants have been more tight-lipped about their brain interface aspirations, we've seen huge firms like Sony and Chinese tech giant Tencent file patents referencing brainwave-based controls. Meanwhile, plenty of examples have already emerged of disabled gamers using tools like Elon Musk's Neuralink to play mainstream games like Counter-Strike.

Meanwhile, Apple is currently testing support for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS, in partnership with Brooklyn-based startup Synchron , using a synthetic vein implanted in the brain’s motor cortex.

"Google has a massive mobile opportunity, and it's partly thanks to Apple","This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Google's phones, tablets, and, yes, XR glasses are all about to be supercharged by AI.

Google needs to seize this moment. Bank of America analysts this week even called Google's slew of new AI announcements a ""Trojan horse"" for its device business.

For years, Apple's iOS and Google's Android have battled it out. Apple leads in the US in phone sales, though it still trails Android globally. The two have also gradually converged; iOS has become more customizable, while Android has become cleaner and easier to use. As hardware upgrades have slowed in recent years, the focus has shifted to the smarts inside the device.

That could be a big problem for Apple. Its AI rollouts have proven lackluster with users, while more enticing promised features have been delayed. The company is reportedly trying to rebuild Siri entirely using large language models. Right now, it's still behind Google and OpenAI, and that gap continues to widen.

During Google's I/O conference this week, the search giant bombarded us with new AI features. Perhaps the best example was a particularly grabby demo of Google's ""Project Astra"" assistant helping someone fix their bike by searching through the bike manual, pulling up a YouTube video, and calling a bike shop to see if certain supplies were in stock.

It was, of course, a highly polished promotional video, but it made Siri look generations behind.

""It has long been the case that the best way to bring products to the consumer market is via devices, and that seems truer than ever,"" wrote Ben Thompson, analyst and Stratechery author, in an I/O dispatch this week.

""Android is probably going to be the most important canvas for shipping a lot of these capabilities,"" he added.

Google's golden opportunity

Apple has done a good job of locking users into its ecosystem with iMessage blue bubbles, features like FaceTime, and peripherals like the Apple Watch that require an iPhone to use.

Google's Pixel phone line, meanwhile, remains a rounding error when compared to global smartphone shipments. That's less of a problem when Google has huge partners like Samsung that bring all of its AI features to billions of Android users globally.

While iPhone users will get some of these new features through Google's iOS apps, it's clear that the ""universal assistant"" the company is building will only see its full potential on Android. Perhaps this could finally get iOS users to make the switch.

""We're seeing diminishing returns on a hardware upgrade cycle, which means we're now really focused on the software upgrade cycle,"" Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik told Business Insider.

Without major changes by Apple, Shmulik said he sees the gap in capabilities between Android and iOS only widening.

""If it widens to the point where someone with an iPhone says, 'Well my phone can't do that,' does it finally cause that switching event from what everyone has always considered this incredible lock-in from Apple?"" Shmulik said.

Beyond smartphones

Internally, Google has been preparing for this moment.

The company merged its Pixel, Chrome, and Android teams last year to capitalize on the AI opportunity.

""We are going to be very fast-moving to not miss this opportunity,"" Google's Android chief Sameer Samat told BI at last year's I/O. ""It's a once-in-a-generation moment to reinvent what phones can do. We are going to seize that moment.""

A year on, Google appears to be doing just that. Much of what the company demoed this week is either rolling out to devices imminently or in the coming weeks.

Google still faces the challenge that its relationships with partners like Samsung have come with the express promise that Google won't give its home-grown devices preferential treatment. So, if Google decides to double down on its Pixel phones at the expense of its partners, it could step into a business land mine.

Of course, Google needs to think about more than smartphones. Its renewed bet on XR glasses is a bet on what might be the next-generation computing platform. Meta is already selling its own augmented reality glasses, and Apple is now doubling down on its efforts to get its own smart glasses out by the end of 2026, Bloomberg reported.

Google this week demoed glasses that have a visual overlay to instantly provide information to wearers, which Meta's glasses lack and Apple's first version will reportedly also not have.

The success of Meta's glasses so far is no doubt encouraging news for Google, as a new era of AI devices is ushered in. Now it's poised to get ahead by leveraging its AI chops, and Apple might give it the exact opening it's waited more than a decade for.

""I don't know about an open goal,"" said Shmulik of Apple, ""but it does feel like they've earned themselves a penalty kick.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-opportunity-apple-struggles-lagging-features-2025-5,Technology

as well. At 75, an American man can expect to live to 86, which is 12 years longer than the life expectancy at birth.

Life expectancy is a tricky thing, often misunderstood as a prediction for individuals instead of a statistical average for a group of people.

It is calculated using life tables, which track the death rates of a population across different age groups.

Statisticians start with a hypothetical group (often 100,000 people) and apply the observed mortality at each age to see how many of that group would be expected to survive year by year.

Thus, the average age at death for that group becomes their life expectancy at birth. There are also life expectancy figures calculated for other ages, which take into account the fact that someone has already survived to that age.

This chart uses 2024 data from the Office of Social Security (which uses 2021 mortality rates) to illustrate the latter phenomenon, showing how American life expectancy changes as Americans get older.

However, the older you get, the more your potential lifespan increases.

For example, at 75, an American man can expect to live to 86, which is 12 years longer than the original life expectancy at birth (74 years).

Why does life expectancy improve as you get older?

We made the same graphic in a slightly different way in case it helps improve clarity.



Note: See this visualization first on the Voronoi app.

It’s because most older American adults have already dodged the biggest risks to life: infant mortality, violence, and car crashes.

There is also survivor bias at play.

The lifestyle habits that have allowed them to live so long will only contribute to them living longer.

However, any big environmental change that affects mortality rates in a country (wars, famines, or pandemics) can have a huge impact on life expectancies.

For example, the life expectancy for American men at birth in 2019 was 76, two years longer than their current life expectancies at birth. This is a reflection of pandemic-related deaths in 2021 that increased mortality rates for the population.

Diamond nanoparticles get a quantum upgrade with shell inspired by TV technology,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Putting hypersensitive quantum sensors in a living cell is a promising path for tracking cell growth and diagnosing diseases—even cancers—in their early stages.

Many of the best, most powerful quantum sensors can be created in small bits of diamond, but that leads to a separate issue: It's hard to stick a diamond in a cell and get it to work.

""All kinds of those processes that you really need to probe on a molecular level, you cannot use something very big. You have to go inside the cell. For that, we need nanoparticles,"" said University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering Ph.D. candidate Uri Zvi. ""People have used diamond nanocrystals as biosensors before, but they discovered that they perform worse than what we would expect. Significantly worse.""

Zvi is the first author of a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that tackles this issue. Together with researchers from UChicago PME and the University of Iowa, Zvi united insights from cellular biology, quantum computing, old-fashioned semiconductors and high-definition TVs to both create a revolutionary new quantum biosensor. In doing so, they shed light on a longstanding mystery in quantum materials.

By encasing a diamond nanoparticle with a specially engineered shell—a technique inspired by QLED televisions—the team created not only a quantum biosensor ideal for a living cell, but also uncovered new insights into how a material's surface can be modified to enhance its quantum properties.

""It's already one of the most sensitive things on Earth, and now they've figured out a way to enhance that further in a number of different environments,"" said Zvi's principal investigator, UChicago PME Prof. Aaron Esser-Kahn, a co-author of the paper.

A cell full of diamonds

Qubits hosted in diamond nanocrystals maintain quantum coherence even when the particles are small enough to be ""taken up"" by a living cell—a good metaphor is the cell swallowing and chewing on them without spitting them out. But the smaller the diamond particles, the weaker the quantum signal.

""It excited people for a while that these quantum sensors can be brought into living cells and, in principle, be useful as a sensor,"" said UChicago PME Asst. Prof. Peter Maurer, a co-author of the paper. ""However, while these kind of quantum sensors inside of a big piece of bulk diamond have really good quantum properties, when they are in nano diamonds, the coherent properties, the quantum properties, are actually significantly reduced.""

Here, Zvi turned to an unlikely source for inspiration—quantum dot LED televisions. QLED TVs use vibrant fluorescent quantum dots to broadcast in rich, full colors. In the early days, the colors were bright but unstable, prone to suddenly blinking off.

""Researchers found that surrounding the quantum dots with carefully designed shells suppresses detrimental surface effects and increase their emission,"" Zvi said. ""And today you can use a previously unstable quantum dot as part of your TV.""

Prof. Peter Maurer (left) and first author and Ph.D. candidate Uri Zvi (right), and their collaborators created a revolutionary new quantum biosensor that sheds light on a longstanding question in quantum materials. Credit: Jason Smith

Working with UChicago PME and Chemistry Department quantum dot expert Prof. Dmitri Talapin, a co-author of the paper, Zvi reasoned that since both sets of issues—the quantum dots' fluorescence and the nanodiamond weakened signal—originated with the surface state, a similar approach might work.

But since the sensor is meant to go within a living body, not every shell would work. An immunoengineering expert, Esser-Kahn helped develop a silicon-oxygen (siloxane) shell that would both enhance the quantum properties and not tip off the immune system that something is awry.

""The surface properties of most of these materials are sticky and disordered in a way that the immune cells can tell it's not supposed to be there. They look like a foreign object to an immune cell,"" Esser-Kahn said. ""Siloxane-coated things look like a big, smooth blob of water. And so the body is much more happy to engulf and then chew on a particle like that.""

Previous efforts to improve the quantum properties of diamond nanocrystals through surface engineering had shown limited success. As a result, the team expected only modest gains. Instead, they saw up to fourfold improvements in spin coherence.

That increase—as well as a 1.8-fold increase in fluorescence and separate significant increases to charge stability—was a riddle both baffling and enthralling.

Better and better

""I would try to go to bed at night but stay up thinking 'What's happening there? The spin coherence is getting better—but why?"" said University of Iowa Asst. Prof. Denis Candido, second author of the new paper. ""I'd think 'What if we do this experiment? What if we do this calculation?' It was very, very exciting, and in the end, we found the underlying reason for the improvement of the coherence.""

The interdisciplinary team—bioengineer-turned-quantum-scientist Zvi, immunoengineer Esser-Kahn and quantum engineers Maurer and Talapin—brought Candido and University of Iowa Physics and Astronomy Prof. Michael Flatté in to provide some of the theoretical framework for the research.

""What I found really exciting about this is that some old ideas that were critical for semiconductor electronic technology turned out to be really important for these new quantum systems,"" Flatté said.

They found that adding the silica shell didn't just protect the diamond surface. It fundamentally altered the quantum behavior inside. The material interface was driving electron transfer from the diamond into the shell. Depleting electrons from the atoms and molecules that normally reduce the quantum coherence made a more sensitive and stable way to read signals from living cells.

This enabled the team to identify the specific surface sites that degrade coherence and make quantum devices less effective—solving a long-standing mystery in the quantum sensing field and opening new doors for both engineering innovation and fundamental research.

""The end impact is not just a better sensor, but a new, quantitative framework for engineering coherence and charge stability in quantum nanomaterials,"" Zvi said.",https://phys.org/news/2025-05-diamond-nanoparticles-quantum-shell-tv.html,Technology
3D-printed device enables precise modeling of complex human tissues in the lab,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

The Suspended Tissue Open Microfluidic Patterning, or STOMP device, is small enough to fit on a fingertip, and is expected to advance human tissue modeling for research on a variety of complex diseases. Credit: University of Washington

A new, easily adopted, 3D-printed device will enable scientists to create models of human tissue with even greater control and complexity. An interdisciplinary group of researchers at the University of Washington and UW Medicine led the development of the device.

3D tissue engineering, which recently has undergone other major advances in speed and accuracy, helps biomedical researchers design and test therapies for a range of diseases.

One goal of tissue engineering is to create lab-made environments that recreate the natural habitats of cells.

Suspending cells in a gel between two freestanding posts is one of the current modeling platforms for growing heart, lung, skin and musculoskeletal tissues.

While this approach allows cells to behave as they would inside the body, it has not made it easy to study multiple tissue types together. More precise control over the composition and spatial arrangement of tissues would allow scientists to model complex diseases, such as neuromuscular disorders.

A paper published in Advanced Science details how the new platform lets scientists examine how cells respond to mechanical and physical cues, while creating distinct regions in a suspended tissue. The 3D-printed device is known as STOMP (Suspended Tissue Open Microfluidic Patterning).

Ashleigh Theberge, UW professor of chemistry, and Nate Sniadecki, professor of mechanical engineering and interim codirector of the UW Medicine Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, led the scientific team. The group showed that their device can recreate biological interfaces like bone and ligament, or fibrotic and healthy heart tissue.

The tissue model was created by Dr. Priti Mulimani at the University of Washington Department of Oral Health Sciences, School of Dentistry. Credit: Dr. Priti Mulimani

The first authors of the paper were Amanda Haack, a student in the School of Medicine's medical scientist program and postdoctoral fellow in the Theberge Lab, and Lauren Brown, a Ph.D. student in chemistry. UW faculty members Cole DeForest, professor of chemical engineering and bioengineering, and Tracy Popowics, professor of oral biology in the School of Dentistry, are co-authors.

STOMP enhances a tissue-engineering method called casting, which the researchers compared in simple terms to making Jell-O in a dessert mold. In the lab, the gel is a mixture of living and synthetic materials. These are pipetted into a frame rather than poured into a mold. STOMP uses capillary action—think of water flowing up a straw in a drinking glass—to permit scientists to space out different cell types in whatever pattern an experiment requires, like a cook evenly spreading pieces of fruit in Jell-O.

The researchers put STOMP to the test in two experiments: one that compared the contractile dynamics of diseased and healthy engineered heart tissue, and another that models the ligament that connects a tooth to its bone socket.

The STOMP device is about the size of a fingertip. It docks on to a two-post system originally developed by the Sniadecki Lab to measure the contractile force of heart cells. The tiny piece of hardware contains an open microfluidic channel with geometric features to manipulate the spacing and composition of different cell types, and for creating multiple regions within single suspended tissue without the need for additional equipment or capabilities.

Hydrogel technology from the DeForest Research Group souped up STOMP with another design feature: degradable walls. Tissue engineers can break down the sides of the device and leave the tissues intact.

""Normally when you put cells in a 3D gel,"" Sniadecki said, ""they will use their own contractile forces to pull everything together—which causes the tissue to shrink away from the walls of the mold. But not every cell is super strong, and not every biomaterial can get remodeled like that. So that kind of nonstick quality gave us more versatility.""

Theberge is excited about how other teams will use STOMP.

""This method opens new possibilities for tissue engineering and cell signaling research,"" she said. ""It was a true team effort of multiple groups working across disciplines.""

Scientists Decode Key Motions Behind Brain’s Transport,"Summary: Cells depend on motor proteins like dynein to shuttle materials along microscopic highways, and dysfunction in these proteins can lead to serious neurological disorders. New research captured real-time, high-resolution “movies” of dynein being activated by its partner protein, Lis1, illuminating the step-by-step process.

Scientists observed 16 distinct 3D shapes in the dynein-Lis1 interaction, revealing new insights into how Lis1 unlocks and powers up dynein. These findings could help design targeted treatments for diseases like lissencephaly by restoring proper dynein activity.

Key Facts:

Dynein Activation: Lis1 initiates dynein’s activity by binding to its motor and stalk, transitioning it from an inactive “Phi” state to an active “Chi” state.

Lis1 initiates dynein’s activity by binding to its motor and stalk, transitioning it from an inactive “Phi” state to an active “Chi” state. New Imaging Breakthrough: Time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy captured dynein’s activation in unprecedented detail, revealing 16 structural stages.

Our cells rely on microscopic highways and specialized protein vehicles to move everything—from positioning organelles to carting protein instructions to disposing of cellular garbage.

These highways (called microtubules) and vehicles (called motor proteins) are indispensable to cellular function and survival.

The dysfunction of motor proteins and their associated proteins can lead to severe neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. For example, the dysfunction of Lis1, a partner protein to the motor protein dynein, can lead to the rare fatal birth defect lissencephaly, or “smooth brain,” for which there is no cure.

But therapeutics that target and restore dynein or Lis1 function could change those dismal outcomes—and developing those therapeutics depends on thoroughly understanding how dynein and Lis1 interact.

New research from the Salk Institute and UC San Diego captured short movies of Lis1 “turning on” dynein. The movies allowed the team to catalogue 16 shapes that the two proteins take as they interact, some of which have never been seen before.

These insights will be foundational for designing future therapeutics that restore dynein and Lis1 function, since they shine a light on precise locations where drugs could interact with the proteins.

The findings were published in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology on May 23, 2025.

“I’ve always been interested in motor proteins, but dynein is especially fascinating to me because it’s the only motor protein that can move toward the cell’s center,” says co-corresponding author Agnieszka Kendrick, assistant professor at Salk.

“The impressive tools we have today in the lab made it possible for us to create a movie of dynein and Lis1 interacting in real time. Having this detailed view of their stepwise partnership will help us find ways to restore their activity in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.”

Background: Unlocking dynein

Dynein is made up of two identical halves that each contain 1) a “stalk” that attaches to the microtubule, 2) a “tail” that attaches to whatever is being hauled by the protein, and 3) a “motor” that powers its travel.

The physical movement of dynein looks a bit like walking—as the motor uses up cellular fuel called ATP, the stalks take turns detaching, swinging forward, and reattaching to the microtubule below.

Since dynein is a one-way ticket toward the valuable genetic vault that is the nucleus, its activity is tightly regulated. When it’s not carting anything, dynein detaches entirely from the microtubule highways and floats freely in a locked-up state, called “Phi.”

Over the last few years, Kendrick and colleagues have been hard at work piecing together how dynein becomes “unlocked.”

So far, their studies have revealed that Lis1 acts as a key, wedging itself into dynein’s structure and unlocking it into an open shape called “Chi.” However, these insights were based on still images of dynein and Lis1, taken sporadically across various stages of their interaction.

While there was a lot to learn from these freeze frames, a deeper understanding of how the two proteins interact could only come from watching them in action.

Key discoveries: How Lis1 and dynein interact

“Our approach to imaging dynein and Lis1 is more comprehensive than any previous study on this protein,” says co-corresponding author Andres Leschziner, professor at UC San Diego.

“By capturing movies rather than pictures, we confirmed 16 detailed, 3D shapes that dynein takes as it interacts with Lis1—several of which are entirely unique to our study.”

The team used a yeast model to capture dynein and Lis1, since—unlike human cells—yeast cells can survive when dynein and Lis1 levels are altered.

And because dynein’s structure is functionally the same in both human and yeast cells, what we learn about yeast dynein can still be applied to human dynein.

Using this yeast model, the researchers isolated dynein and Lis1 and decreased the temperature dramatically to slow down dynein activity.

They then captured a high-definition 3D movie of dynein interacting with Lis1 that could represent the timeline between dynein’s Phi (locked) and Chi (unlocked) states using time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

Cryo-EM uses beams of electrons to construct a 3D image of a molecule with down-to-the-atom detail. Previous studies have used cryo-EM and other imaging methods to construct images of dynein in its locked and unlocked states.

The time-resolved component, however, is new. Instead of capturing a single structure at a single time point, time-resolved capture identifies different structures over time to create a movie.

This allowed Salk and UC San Diego scientists to track sub-second changes in dynein’s structure, explaining the step-by-step process it takes to transition from locked to unlocked states.

The new video shows that the first step to activating dynein involves Lis1 attaching to dynein’s motor subunit. Like dynein, Lis1 is also made up of two identical halves. In this first interaction, one half of Lis1 attaches to dynein, in turn relieving dynein of its locked state and turning its motor on by altering its shape to facilitate more rapid, efficient utilization of ATP—nature’s energy molecule.

Turning on this ATP-fueled engine is key to initiating dynein’s ability to travel on the cell’s microtubule highways.

Then, the second half of Lis1 attaches itself to dynein—this time on the stalk. This second Lis1 interaction completes the activation and solidifies dynein’s Chi state. It also further increases dynein’s motor activity, revving it up for action.

Looking ahead: Repairing Lis1 and dynein dysfunction in developmental and neurological disorders

“These findings certainly take us closer than we’ve ever been to understanding why Lis1 dysfunction has such a devastating effect on dynein activity, and how that contributes to developmental and neurological disorders down the line,” says Kendrick.

The new high-resolution, 3D structural insight into dynein and Lis1 could pave the way for treating their dysfunction in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies can explore how different mutations to Lis1 affect its interactions with dynein, and how this contributes to lissencephaly and other rare genetic disorders.

Ultimately, the more that’s known about the physical structures of these two proteins, the easier it will be to create drugs that “fit” into those structures and restore their activity.

“Multiple steps of dynein activation by Lis1 visualized by cryo-EM” by Agnieszka Kendrick et al. Nature Structural & Molecular Biology

Abstract

Multiple steps of dynein activation by Lis1 visualized by cryo-EM

Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is an essential molecular motor controlled in part by autoinhibition. Lis1, a key dynein regulator mutated in the neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly, plays a role in dynein activation.

We recently identified a structure of partially autoinhibited dynein bound to Lis1, which suggests an intermediate state in dynein’s activation pathway.

However, other structural information is needed to fully understand how Lis1 activates dynein.

Here, we used cryo-EM and yeast dynein and Lis1 incubated with ATP at different time points to reveal conformations that we propose represent additional intermediate states in dynein’s activation pathway.

We solved 16 high-resolution structures, including 7 distinct dynein and dynein–Lis1 structures from the same sample.

Our data support a model in which Lis1 relieves dynein autoinhibition by increasing its basal ATP hydrolysis rate and promoting conformations compatible with complex assembly and motility.

Together, this analysis advances our understanding of dynein activation and the contribution of Lis1 to this process.",https://neurosciencenews.com/lis1-genetics-neurodevelopment-29130/,Technology

Infostealer malware suspected in major username and password leak

Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler reported discovering a publicly accessible, unprotected database containing more than 184 million login credentials from services including Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft, Roblox, Snapchat, and many others.

Wired noted that the leak also included data from Apple, Amazon, Nintendo, Spotify, Twitter, Yahoo, banks, healthcare providers, and government portals.

Fowler was unable to determine the database’s origin, its intended purpose, or how long it remained exposed. After reporting it to the hosting provider, access was restricted.

He verified the data’s authenticity by contacting individuals using emails listed in the database and identifying himself as a researcher.

Fowler suspects the data was collected using infostealer malware, which targets credentials stored in browsers, email clients, and messaging apps. Cybercriminals may distribute such malware through phishing attacks, malicious links, or cracked software.

To avoid these threats, users are advised to scrutinize links in emails and messages, confirm website URLs before visiting, and avoid downloading software from unverified sources.

Apple users should rely on the Mac App Store or reputable developers’ websites. Promptly installing OS and app updates is also essential for staying secure.

Fowler’s discovery highlights the persistent threat of infostealer malware and the need for users to remain vigilant when interacting online.

"Fujifilm's X Half, a New OnePlus Tablet, and Fender's GarageBand Rival—Your Gear News of the Week","This week, Fujifilm announced a new digital half-frame compact camera called the X Half. Like half-frame film cameras, the X Half shoots vertical frames, but records to an 18-megapixel sensor instead. The lens is a 32mm (35mm equivalent) f/2.8 aperture, which is close to the lenses of the X100 series cameras. The X Half looks like a combination of Fujifilm's popular X100VI and an old Rollie 35 film camera. It's small and stylish, which is part of the appeal here.

The X Half is also designed to be fun rather than a ""serious"" camera (whatever that means). Serious camera fans, be warned: The X Half is JPG-only; there are no RAW files. Out of the box, there are 10 film simulations—just like Fujifilm's ""serious"" cameras—along with 18 filters to simulate things like light leaks or expired film. Since the files are JPGs, whatever filters you apply can't be unapplied in post.

Courtesy of Fujifilm

In another nod to film cameras, there is a Film Roll mode which allows you to lock in a film simulation or filter combo and then shoot 24, 26, or 72 images (like a roll of film) without being able to review the image on the rear screen or see anything about it until you dump the pics to the companion phone app.

It won't be for everyone, but I'm looking forward to testing this one as we rarely see a camera that doesn't take itself too seriously. My only hesitation is the recommended price of $849, which is a little steep for something that doesn't offer RAW files. —Scott Gilbertson

OnePlus Has a New Android Tablet

The Android tablet market has been gradually growing since Google decided to give it some love in 2022—there are more options to choose from now than in years. OnePlus is keeping things chugging along with the OnePlus Pad 3—its predecessor is our favorite Android tablet, so there are high expectations for this slate.

Courtesy of OnePlus

Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, the high-end processor powering all the 2025 Android phones, this is a flagship tablet through and through. OnePlus hasn't shared the full details about the tablet yet, but it supports Open Canvas, the company's multitasking software. There are some integrations for Apple users, too—you can control a Mac remotely, and file share via drag and drop. You can also pair it with three accessories (sold separately): a Smart Keyboard, a Stylo 2 stylus, and a Folio Case.

The Pad 3 comes in Storm Blue and will be available in the US and Canada beginning June 5. Pricing hasn't been shared yet, but it's not a stretch to imagine a higher MSRP than the $550 launch price of the OnePlus Pad 2. The company recently raised the price of the OnePlus Watch 3 to $550 (from $330) shortly after tariffs were announced, but then brought the MSRP down to $350—still an increase. It's a direct contender to Samsung's recently announced Tab S10 FE.

Fender's GarageBand Rival

Fender has announced a new cross-platform app called Fender Studio that will let users easily record, jam, and release music from anywhere. The free app is available for iOS, Android, PC, Linux, and macOS, and looks to take on Apple's GarageBand for free recording app supremacy. It can use your phone's microphone or any compatible interface, and includes modeling for classic amplifiers, effects pedals, and mixing plugins. You can even tune vocals and use a vocoder.

This democratization of high-end recording follows Fender’s acquisition of affordable recording brand PreSonus. PreSonus makes Studio One, another great piece of recording software, among our favorite digital audio workstations. With Fender Studio, users can get much of that same functionality, a boon for folks who don’t want to splash out on fancy software to make demos or to record basic audio tracks. So far, it works great in my experience, with an easy-to-use interface that scales perfectly between PC, tablet, and cell phone. I like how similar it looks to Studio One, which has a clean and simple look, a key for recording software to be any good. —Parker Hall

A Last of Us Guitar

Taylor Guitars is making a limited run of replica model 314c acoustic guitars identical to the model used in HBO’s The Last of Us. The guitar features Taylor’s famous cutaway style, with a custom moth inlay on the third fret. It’s a beautiful instrument that might end up being collectible someday, beyond fans of the show; the moth inlay is prettier than an HBO logo, and the tobacco sunburst and ivoroid accents give it a kind of modern vintage vibe. The guitar is available for purchase now for $2,799, and is built on demand with an expected delivery time of six to 10 weeks. They all come with a hard case. —Parker Hall

Coros Introduces a Repair Program

I consistently pick Garmin watches over Coros models in my Best Fitness Trackers guide. However, that margin is getting slimmer, and the news that you can now repair Coros devices gives the brand a boost. Coros' new repair program increases the lifespan of your expensive wearable. You can send in a damaged device, pay a nominal repair fee, and receive a refurbished replacement while your device is being repaired.

Available repairs include replacing a broken screen, button, dial, or defective battery, and all Coros devices are eligible, including the latest Vertix 2S, all the Pace watches, and the solar-powered bike computer. Unlike comparable repair programs, like AppleCare, Coros owners do not have to pay into a separate warranty or coverage program in addition to the repair cost. Coros also posts the repair prices, with most well under $100. It’s worth noting here that I’ve never had to fix a Coros device, and I've found them all to be pretty durable. But WIRED contributor Steph Pearson shattered her Coros Dura bike computer's screen while mountain biking, so the news that you can get it fixed for a reasonable price is welcome. —Adrienne So

Scientists test surprising new cow feed with major benefits for farmers and animals: 'It's a win-win situation',"""Efficient milk production may not need to be at the planet's expense.""

It's not often that cows are part of global warming solutions, but a new type of feed could change that. University of Florida researchers have discovered that a new cow feed could cut down on cow burps, which are notorious for releasing methane, ScienceDaily reported.

Methane is a heat-trapping gas that has caused about 30% of the rising temperatures over several decades, per the IEA. The typical food cows eat, like grass and hay, produces methane during a cow's digestion. Methane then escapes the cow when it burps. According to Greenpeace, a cow can burp as often as every 90 seconds, which can cause the release of a lot of methane into the atmosphere.

However, UF researchers have been testing a cow feed made from flaxseed and pea protein. In lab testing, the food successfully reduced methane production during digestion.

Lowering methane has been a priority for environmental advocates. Rising temperatures, caused in part by methane, have contributed to glacier ice melt, rising sea levels, and extreme weather patterns. Innovations like this new cattle feed can make it possible to clean up one of agriculture's biggest offenders, leading to a more sustainable and less polluting food system. That means cleaner air and healthier communities might be around the corner.

The food has an additional benefit of requiring less energy to digest, leaving more energy for a cow's milk production.

""It's a win-win situation,"" Antonio Faciola, the study's lead researcher and an associate professor at UF's Department of Animal Sciences, said, per ScienceDaily. ""Every time we reduce methane, we keep that energy in the cow's body."" This breakthrough shows that efficient milk production may not need to be at the planet's expense.

UF researchers aren't the only ones working on a solution to cow-related methane production. Another research team is studying a cow vaccine that could reduce methane output. Scientists are also working on changing cow microbiomes and adding red algae to cow food to curb the problem.

Innovations like better cow feed can make a real difference, but reducing human reliance on cows altogether could also help the environment. A switch to plant-based foods can ease pressure on the dairy industry, essentially lowering methane-related pollution and offering a clearer path toward a climate-friendly food system.

Oppo has launched a new sibling in its A5 lineup, the A5x 5G. Oppo packs a decent set of features into its new budget-range smartphone. The 5G-enabled device features a 6.67-inch LCD display that outputs at 1604 x 720 pixels resolution with a 120 Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 1000 nits. It comes with MIL-STD certification and is IP65 rated.

This time around, Oppo went with the MediaTek chipset. The device is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset paired with 4 GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of internal storage, which is further expandable up to 1 TB via microSD card. Like its 4G counterpart, the smartphone retains the same 32 MP primary camera and a 5 MP front-facing camera for selfies and video chats.

Software-wise, it runs Android 15-based ColorOS 15 out of the box, and there’s no word on software support from the brand, indicating the software updates may never arrive. A 6,000 mAh battery powers the internals and supports 45 W wired charging. Other features include a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, WiFi 5, and Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity.

I found a Linux-friendly Lenovo mini PC - and it drives up to six external monitors,"ZDNET's key takeaways Lenovo's ThinkStation P3 Tiny is available now starting at $860 for the low-tier configurations, but upgrades will bring it close beyond $2,000.

There's some powerful hardware here packed into a tiny frame, and pro users will appreciate its upgradeability and support for up to six monitors.

It's pricey, the power supply is almost as big as the device itself, and it's specialized for the enterprise space. View now at Lenovo

The aptly named Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Tiny is a small but mighty workstation with huge power despite its diminutive form. It looks more like a router (complete with antenna) than a PC, but it has a broad selection of configurations that serve various functions for pro users in the enterprise space.

When I went hands-on with the ThinkStation P3 Tiny, the first thing I noticed when picking it up was its weight. Yes, it's small, but this device is heavy thanks to all that hardware crammed into its tiny frame.

Also: The 5 coolest gadgets I saw at Computex 2025 (and that you can actually buy)

The maximum configuration includes up to a 14th-generation Intel Core i9 processor, Nvidia RTX T1000 GPU, up to two 2TB SSD drives, and up to a whopping 96GB of RAM. My review unit had 16GB of RAM, but the price point of the workstation can vary wildly, depending on the hardware.

To give a ballpark price point, the upper-middle-ground configuration with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD starts at around $2,200, while the cost can dip closer to $1,000 for lighter hardware, and jump up with more RAM and memory.

So, who is this workstation aimed at? The ThinkStation P3 Tiny is first and foremost an enterprise workstation designed for professional workloads. Its small size requires minimal desk space, particularly in settings other than an office, such as a studio.

If you're looking for out-of-the-box usability, the Tiny can also be bundled with supported Lenovo peripherals, including keyboards and mice. Lenovo's Premier Support offers on-site and virtual hardware and software support.

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

The workstation has plenty of raw horsepower to blaze through basic tasks like web browsing and multitasking. For architecture, design, or finance professionals, the large amounts of on-device storage and CPU power will cover all your bases, especially with the potential to upgrade.

In my testing, 4K 60fps video editing in DaVinci Resolve performed seamlessly, with fast renders and minimal lag. However, there was some choppiness when the technology was pushed with more demanding commands, which is to be expected. When it comes to drafting and modeling, this machine is designed to run industry-standard software like AutoCAD or Revit.

Also: I replaced my laptop with Microsoft's 12-inch Surface Pro - here's my verdict after two weeks

I also want to mention Linux support. If you're keen to break your dependency on Windows and want a powerful Linux machine, the ThinkStation P3 Tiny can come with Linux Ubuntu pre-installed at purchase, saving you $100 off the price without Windows.

I wouldn't recommend taking this step unless you are committed to using a Linux-powered workstation. However, it's a solid option for Linux out of the box, especially if you have prior experience and use a PC with a soon-to-be-expired version of Windows.

Continuing with its enterprise-first use case, this machine is easy to open up, which is key for sustainable support. The top of the device slides right off with one screw, revealing the CPU, GPU, and other internal components that can be replaced or upgraded as needed.

Conversely, the bottom of the device is easily popped off to access the dual RAM slots and two M.2 NVMe SSDs. The device comes with a Samsung SSD via PCI 4.0, which achieved fast transfer speeds in our CrystalDiskMark read and write speed tests.

The machine also boasts extensive ports and connectivity options, both on the front and back. The front features two 10GB/second USB-A ports and a USB-C (note: not a Thunderbolt port) with a headphone jack.

Also: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)

On the back, you've got four mini DisplayPorts that jack right into the GPU, enabling professional-grade visuals for the enterprise setting. There's also an HDMI and DisplayPort that run off the CPU, allowing for six external displays simultaneously.

The ThinkStation P3 Tiny's power supply is anything but. The gigantic power brick is almost as big as the Tiny itself, supplying 300W of power to the device and requiring some thought for setting up. I recommend not placing the power supply on top of the PC, as both are heat sources. Also, this isn't a gaming laptop, but the hardware can be carried if a user has gaming inclinations.

ZDNET's buying advice

If you're in the market for a pro-minded mini PC, Lenovo's ThinkStation P3 Tiny is a solid choice, offering a highly customizable form factor, support for Linux, and a veritable library of ports. I would recommend this device for pro users in an enterprise setting, particularly for IT teams looking to supply a team with multiple devices using the same configuration.

This PC is well-suited for creative production in a studio setting with a ton of horsepower in a small frame and support for up to six external monitors. If the above two sentences don't immediately resonate with your desired use case, I would say this machine isn't the best option. It's not particularly cheap, even on the low-end.

If you're looking for a more consumer-friendly mini PC, I recommend Apple's Mac Mini M4, which is a fraction of the price. If you're looking for a mini PC oriented to gaming, check out Minisforum's AI X1 Pro.

What are the tariffs in the US? The recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production. Also: Tariff war has tech buyers wondering what's next. Here's what we know Laptops and PCs are also hit hard by the new U.S. tariffs, with import duties potentially increasing prices by up to 35%. Many major brands still rely on Chinese and Vietnamese factories for assembly, meaning consumers could soon pay significantly more for everything from budget Chromebooks to high-end gaming rigs. These tariffs may accelerate efforts to move production to regions like Mexico or India, but shoppers can expect higher costs and fewer discounts in the short term. Right now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.

"‘ARC Raiders’ Gets A Promising, Imminent Release Date Update","ARC Raiders Embark

Players recently fought and stealthed their way from the ARC Raiders Closed Alpha, and almost everyone had a similar thought:

This game seems ready for release.

That’s not usually the case with an Alpha, and while there were certainly balance issues, it felt like a complete game perhaps minus a few things that were being held in the test. But it didn’t even look like it needed say, visual polish.

There may be a reason for that, and some players believe they’ve found the actual release date for ARC Raiders, which may be imminent.

A post-Alpha update was added to the game and for ten minutes, players dug around to find that through the .exe file it led to a “tick counter” link which ended on June 6. In what seems like an unlikely coincidence, Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest show begins on, you guessed it, June 6.

You will also never guess when Embark’s last game, The Finals, debuted. That was at The Game Awards 2023, where it was instantly playable when it was shown off. A “shadow drop.”

The one difference was that there was an actual open beta for The Finals a month before The Game Awards, where there has not been anything like that here. But:

1) The game feeling ready to release

2) This dug-up date being the day Summer Games Fest starts

3) Embark shadow-dropping The Finals at a different Keighley event

I mean, that all points to the idea that this June 6 date, just under two weeks from now, may in fact pan out.

Arc Raiders Embark

ARC Raiders was viewed as a solid new entry in the extraction shooter genre during its last Closed Alpha, with its playercount increasing each day during the test. It also had the benefit of running the test at the same time as rival extraction shooter Marathon, the upcoming Bungie game and most players would say it compared very favorably. Marathon was more unfinished in what felt like a true Alpha test ahead of an alleged September 23 release date. Bungie just stumbled into a controversy when it was revealed that stolen art assets have been used in the game.

ARC Raiders has had no such controversy and it would simply not be surprising if it dropped at Summer Games Fest. One issue with shadow drops, however, is that everyone is suddenly rushing to play all at once, creating server or login issues, which is exactly what happened with The Finals. But hopefully they’re preparing for that.

Huawei Pura 80 Ultra rumored to use dual periscope camera setup,"A new Huawei Pura 80 Ultra rumor suggests that one of the experimental prototypes has a dual periscope camera setup. The company is not only testing primary camera sensors but also an advanced component to boost macrophotography experience.

Weibo tipster @DigitalChatStation has revealed that Huawei is evaluating a dual-periscope camera system for the Pura 80 Ultra flagship. If the latest rumor is accurate, consumers can witness impressive zooming capability and sharper images.

Apart from the tipster’s words, the device has even allegedly leaked in live images, showing off a dual periscope telephoto lens unit on the rear camera module.

The tipster adds that both periscope sensors will be of 50MP and use an RYYB filter. The Red-Yellow-Yellow-Blue filter captures more light than an RGGB filter.

It replaces two green filters with yellow color to build a wider spectrum of light to reach the sensor. These filters effectively boost the sensor’s sensitivity to light. It also reduces noise in low-light images, making them brighter and clearer.

Meanwhile, a dual-periscope camera will probably cover more or different focal lengths and create a better image-capturing scenario for consumers.

Note that the dual-periscope camera solution is still in the testing phase and hasn’t been implemented yet on the smartphone. But based on the leaked images, it seems Huawei could use this new technology for the upcoming flagship.

Currently, OPPO is the only brand to use a dual-periscope camera setup for its Find X8 Ultra smartphone. The device features a quad-cam system with a 50MP main lens, two 50MP periscope telephotos with 3x and 6x optical zoom, and a 50MP ultrawide shooter.

Due to dual-periscope and better zooming capabilities, users can achieve smoother and clearer images irrespective of the lighting conditions. After OPPO, Huawei could pick this technology for the Pura 80 Ultra.

Huawei P series: Periscope Upgrade

The Chinese phone maker introduced an F2.1 Ultra Lighting Periscope Camera with the P60 Pro. It has been one of the biggest sensors used in a periscope device.

It can take up to 178% more light than its predecessor and 288% more light for the telephoto camera, compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Later, Huawei used an enhanced telephoto sensor with a retractable lens for the Pura 70 Ultra.

Thus, we can expect major enhancements to the camera segment with the Pura 80 Ultra.",https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-pura-80-ultra-rumored-to-use-dual-periscope-camera-setup/,Technology
"Samsung Galaxy A smartphones in 2025: Galaxy A56, A36, A26 and A16 in comparison","While Samsung has streamlined its mid-range smartphone lineup in recent years, the company still offers many different devices in that price range. Therefore, we take a closer look at the differences by comparing the Galaxy A06, A16, A26, A36 and Galaxy A56.

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

The Samsung Galaxy A-series is quite popular and has captured a significant market share in Europe and many other regions around the world. However, with six smartphones to choose from, it's not exactly straightforward. Starting at roughly $100, the Galaxy A06 (from $103 on Amazon) is the entry-level option. This is the only device in the Galaxy A-series that we haven't tested thus far, so it won't be included in this comparison.

One step further up is the Galaxy A16, which is available in both LTE and 5G variants. All other phones support the latest cellular standard. There are also differences in terms of the display glass, as both Galaxy A16 models use Corning Gorilla Glass 5, while the others opt for the newer Gorilla Glass Victus+. Similarly, these handsets are equipped with different types of memory. Only the Galaxy A56 comes with LPDDR5 RAM, while Samsung’s other mid-range phones use older LPDDR4x RAM. It's a similar situation with internal storage. The A16 gets UFS 2.2, all other Galaxy A models offer UFS 3.1.

Samsung has not specified any differences regarding the main camera sensors, all of which have 50 megapixels and an identical aperture of f/1.8. The displays are also very similar, but the more expensive offerings also offer a better screen-to-body ratio.

All further differences between Samsung's current Galaxy A-series smartphones are summarized in the table below.

The feature isn’t a new change to the app, but is now coming for all group sizes. Whether it’s a 2-member group chat or a 20, you can use the voice chat feature.

Voice chat enables users to connect with their friends or family members live over audio without leaving the WhatsApp groups or switching to an audio call. Thus, other members in the group can easily join the conversation whenever they want.

The feature was earlier available only in large groups. But the company has now broken this rule and is bringing the useful feature to all groups. One can start a voice chat by swiping up from the bottom of your chat and holding it for a few seconds.

Note that being a chat-based feature, it won’t notify or ring anyone. Hence, members can join or leave the chat as per their preference. Voice chat will remain pinned at the bottom of the conversation to easily access call controls at any time.

"Huawei, Honor, and more inked UFCS 2.0 fast charging agreement","Huawei, Honor, OPPO, and vivo have signed a new agreement related to the UFCS 2.0 fast charging protocol. Once again, all four companies are ready to improve the charging segment for their devices, delivering an enhanced experience.

UFCS refers to Universal Fast Charging Standard. It is a charging protocol developed by many Chinese brands to create a unified fast charging way across various devices.

It addresses the previous lack of interoperability between different fast charging technologies by combining power adapter solutions from several brands. This technology eventually offers a faster, safer, and more adaptable charging solution.

Earlier, Chinese brands used to have their fast charging technology that boosts the device battery life, but it didn’t work at a universal level. Later, Huawei and other companies joined UFCS protocol to form a better charging tech for their devices.

As of now, the China Communications Standards Association, Guangdong Fast Charging Industry Association, and the Telecommunications Device Industry Association jointly conducted the 2025 Unified Fast Charging Conference.

During the event, the above-mentioned companies launched the UFCS 2.0, with 40W fast charging solution. This standard brings advanced technical optimizations, enhanced 40W power intercommunication, and a reverse charging feature.

At the conference, Huawei, Honor, OPPO, and vivo have inked a mutual agreement based on the UFCS 2.0 fast charging protocol and authorization intention.

This agreement suggests the companies will adopt the latest UFCS fast charging solution for their devices to boost their battery life and offer a stable experience to users.

This Android smartwatch released last year still outruns the competition - and it's on sale,"Matthew Miller/ZDNET

For Memorial Day, you can find the OnePlus Watch 2 on sale for $245 at Amazon and $250 at OnePlus for a limited time.

When OnePlus announced the OnePlus Watch in 2021, I immediately placed an order because the hardware looked compelling and priced at $159. After a few weeks, I returned the device due to its sheer lack of offering anything of value.

The original OnePlus Watch was powered by the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), which was perfectly fine, as many smartwatches run lean and mean. However, last year's OnePlus Watch 2 takes things to the next level by offering RTOS and Wear OS 4 on a single watch with a dual-engine architecture. With this unique approach, the device is one of the most efficient Wear OS watches available today, with longer battery life than any other Google Wear OS device or Apple Watch.

Also: I highly recommend shopping these health tracker Memorial Day deals

In addition to a powerful operating system strategy, OnePlus has created one of the most elegant smartwatches available. The device incorporates stainless steel in the watch body, a 2.5D smooth sapphire crystal watch face, and a durable silicone watch band. The right-side buttons are stylishly incorporated into the bezel, with a round button on top and an oval one on the bottom.

The OnePlus Watch 2 is built to meet 5 ATM water resistance and has an IP68 rating, so you can wear it without worrying about swimming and other outdoor adventures. In addition, the device has been built to satisfy MIL-STD-810H standards, so it beats out even the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

Matthew Miller/ZDNET

OnePlus states the watch will last for 100 hours in Smart Mode, 48 hours with heavy use, and up to 12 days in power-saver mode. It has a 500mAh battery. In my two weeks of testing, I could wear the watch 24/7 and charge it up every three to four days. I wore the device for running and walking with GPS tracking turned on, indoor rowing for active heart-rate tracking, and more.

The battery will be consumed faster with the always-on display mode enabled. But as I found the lift-to-wake feature performed well, I kept the always-on display turned off when I first tested it.

Even though the OnePlus Watch 2 has excellent battery life, it also supports 7.5W VOOC fast charging, so you can charge the device up to 100% in just an hour and get a day of use in a much shorter period. A long battery life with processor efficiency and fast charging are the best combos for a smartwatch.

Also: My favorite Garmin safety feature is coming to Forerunner models - and I can't recommend it enough

Dual frequency, L5 and L1, satellite position is present, with support for Beidou, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and QZSS GNSS. The watch tracked me in almost the same way as my dedicated GPS sports watches. And with support for Wear OS, you can use your dedicated watch applications if you don't want to use OHealth. Heart-rate tracking on the watch was also accurate.

Matthew Miller/ZDNET

OnePlus requires the use of the OHealth app on your Android phone, and the watch does not work with an Apple iPhone. The Wear OS app is not used, as the watch apps, settings, and health and wellness features are managed through said app.

The OHealth app offers a clean user interface, and I prefer using it over the Google and Fitbit apps found on Pixel Watches. At this time, the data collected by the OnePlus Watch 2 remains in OHealth, with OnePlus publicly stating it has future plans to support syncing to other services, such as Strava.

Screenshot by Matthew Miller/ZDNET

The OHealth app and OnePlus Watch 2 support tracking your heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, sleep, workouts, and more. The OHealth app is also used to manage your selected watch faces and the Wear OS tiles that appear when you swipe left and right on the watch face. The OHealth app contains many settings, and I find the software easier to navigate than the Wear OS app on a Pixel phone.

Also: Your Oura ring just got a major upgrade that fixes its biggest flaw - for free

Also, make sure to check out the extensive number of workout and health settings, which include heart-rate alerts, breathing assessments while you sleep, auto-workout detection, and even customization of the displays for your favorite workouts.

Matthew Miller/ZDNET

While the OnePlus Watch 2 is a significantly better watch than the first-generation device, there is room for improvement. There is no option for cellular connectivity, the single 47mm diameter with 80 grams of weight isn't the best for people with smaller wrists, there is no support for fall detection, there is no capability to control a OnePlus phone camera from the watch (this is coming in a future update), women's health-tracking features are not present, the watch cannot capture ECG readings, and there is no skin-temperature sensor.

However, I loved wearing this elegant watch and swiping across the face to access my favorite tiles. The Google Pixel Watch is too small for me, and the battery life is too short to enjoy its functionality. The OnePlus Watch 2 shows there is hope for better options at a reasonable price.

ZDNET's buying advice

After testing the first OnePlus Watch, I had little confidence that OnePlus would impress me with another RTOS smartwatch. I was frankly blown away by the work that the company has done to make the OnePlus Watch 2 one of the best watches available for Android smartphone users, while still having room for improvement.

At around $250 right now, the device is a must-buy for OnePlus phone owners and a watch that all Android smartphone users should consider. You can also look forward to future software updates that will make this watch an even better investment.

When will this deal expire? As per OnePlus, this deal will end on May 31, 2025. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings.

What are the tariffs in the US? The recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production. CNET: Tariff Pricing Tracker: We're Watching 11 Products You Might Need to Buy Headphones and wearable devices, which are predominantly manufactured in these regions, are now subject to tariffs as high as 54% on Chinese imports and 46% on Vietnamese goods. As a result, consumers may see price increases of approximately 20% on these items. Manufacturers are exploring options like relocating production to countries with lower tariffs, but such shifts are complex and may not provide immediate relief. In the short term, shoppers should anticipate higher costs for headphones and wearables due to these trade policies. Show more

Apple Music vs. Spotify: Which Streaming Music Platform Reigns Supreme?,"Music is an indulgence you can enjoy at home, at work, or while going about your daily activities. Streaming music services make listening convenient thanks to their vast catalogs, diverse playlists, and expansive device compatibility. Apple Music and Spotify are two of the most popular streaming services, but which one should you pick as your main music source? After thoroughly testing both, I'm here to help you decide which streaming music platform is best based on price, content, discoverability, stream quality, and more.

(Credit: Apple/Spotify/PCMag)

Plans and Prices

Apple Music's Individual plan ($10.99 per month) and Family plan ($16.99 per month, covering six people) cost slightly less than Spotify's equivalent tiers ($11.99 and $19.99 per month, respectively). Both services offer a discounted Student rate for $5.99 per month. These premium packages lack ads and offer unlimited skips per hour. You'll enjoy offline playback on mobile, too. That's where the price similarities end.

Spotify has a Duo package ($16.99 per month) aimed at couples that saves a few bucks if you don't need a full Family plan. Don't want to spend any money on streaming music? Check out the ad-supported Spotify Free, which limits your skips per hour and only lets you listen to shuffled songs—you can't play tracks on demand.

Apple Music, on the other hand, lacks a free tier. It's a subscription or bust. However, you get a free three-month trial upon purchasing AirPods, an iPhone, or another eligible Apple hardware.

If free sounds good, Spotify is a worthwhile choice. If an ad-free subscription with a lower price than Spotify's premium offerings is more your speed, go with Apple Music.

Winner: Tie

Content: Music, Video, Podcasts, and Audiobooks

Apple Music and Spotify have more than 100 million songs on their platforms, plus many playlists and videos. That means no matter the service you select, you'll have a lifetime's worth of tunes. So, it's the other content that may sway you in one direction or the other.

Apple Music offers live radio, which Spotify lacks. That includes local stations and six dedicated Apple stations. However, Spotify trounces Apple Music with nearly seven million podcasts and 250,000 audiobooks. Those are huge numbers. Apple Music features just two million podcasts and zero audiobooks. Simply put, Spotify has more entertainment variety.

Music Discovery

Any streaming music service worth its salt must have a good search engine and recommendation system. Spotify is the older and more experimental of the two platforms, giving you many ways to find content. For example, its For You page has a fantastic, easy-to-read layout that displays playlists and recently played albums. Scrolling up or down spotlights the latest releases from your favorite artists and related music acts.

Spotify's algorithms auto-generate playlists based on your listening preferences. For example, the Discover Weekly playlist is a cool, weekly mixtape of new music and deep cuts catered to your listening preferences. In addition, AI playlists are a cutting-edge feature that Spotify is exploring. Although still in beta, it lets you generate playlists via text prompts and even emoji. It’s a fantastic way to discover new music if you’re in an adventurous mood. However, if you're more of a hands-off listener, fire up Spotify's AI-powered disc jockey, DJ X, who queues your favorite tracks and adds new ones for variety. Of course, Spotify has curated playlists that cover a wide gamut of musical genres.

Like Spotify, Apple Music's Home tab gives you quick access to new and familiar songs. The service also lets you create Stations, which are essentially endless queues of music based on whatever you’re listening to at the moment. Apple Music's Discovery Station is similar to Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist, as it features a music queue based on your listening habits. Apple Music features many curated playlists across different genres, just like Spotify.

Both services have a search-by-lyric feature. So, if you can't quite remember a song title but you remember the hook, you can use those words to prompt a search. For example, type, ""I said, 'Hey what’s going on,'"" into the search box and you'll get results for the song ""What’s Up?"" by 4 Non Blondes (as well as the arguably superior Slackcircus cover).

Apple Music's discovery and recommendation systems are good, but Spotify's AI-powered DJ and playlists top them.

Music Streaming Quality

Spotify supports audio streams of up to 320kbps. The audio is serviceable for casual listening and could potentially save you money due to its lower data usage compared with Apple Music. That said, Apple Music has better quality audio, no question.

Apple Music streams range between 16-bit/44.1 kHz (CD Quality) and lossless 24-bit/192kHz audio files, which is crisp, high-definition audio . The service also supports spatial audio with Dolby Atmos. Not every track supports it, but many do. Apple even provides extensive playlists with music that takes advantage of this audiophile-centric format.

Keep in mind that this audio disparity may not affect your day-to-day listening experience, depending on how you consume music. This is especially true if you listen via Bluetooth headphones. Bluetooth streaming comes with audio compression and bandwidth limitations, so you won't enjoy the depth and richness Apple Music delivers. Wired connections are a different story. So, audiophiles with high-quality headphones may pick up Apple Music's sonic superiority.

TP-Link Tapo H110 smart universal remote now available in Europe,"TP-Link has launched the Tapo H110 IR Remote Control in various European countries. This Matter-compatible infrared hub allows users to connect regular devices like air conditioners with other smart home products. The system is said to be compatible with 18 types of devices and over 8,000 brands.

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

The Tapo H110 IR Remote Control is now available in some European countries. This smart home product was launched in Japan in 2024 and has recently arrived at Amazon in the Netherlands, Spain and France.



TP-Link’s Tapo H110 is marketed as an “all-in-one infrared remote control”, which can be used to control a wide range of devices in your home. According to the product listing, there are 18 support device types with products from over 8,000 brands; Tapo indicates that this database is refreshed every few months. This IR remote control and hub system supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and is Matter-compatible, meaning it can integrate with many smart home ecosystems. Plus, it supports voice controls with Google Assistant, Siri or Amazon Alexa.



The H110 is set up and controlled via the Tapo app, where you can set up schedules or triggered scenes. For example, you can set the TV to be switched off when your phone’s GPS location is off your property. Alternatively, you could use the IR hub to start your regular air conditioner when the Tapo Smart Temperature and Humidity Monitor (curr. $25.49 at Amazon) detects a certain temperature. Amazon customer reviews state that the device is easy to set up. However, these early users also flag limitations for users who are not already invested in Tapo’s smart home system.



You can now buy the Tapo H110 IR Remote Control at Amazon in some European countries for around €25. The new smart home product is also listed on Amazon UK, though it is not yet available in the country. Whether or when the device could launch in the US remains unclear; TP-Link already sells other Tapo smart home products in this market.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/TP-Link-Tapo-H110-smart-universal-remote-now-available-in-Europe.1023179.0.html,Technology
Mike Blumenkrantz Axes Old Mesa Code: Goodbye Gallium Nine,"While there was the big 62k lines of code patch from Microsoft merged yesterday to Mesa, separately there was also some code cleaning to remove some previously-deprecated code from the codebase.Mike Blumenkrantz with Valve's Linux team took to axing some deprecated code for the Mesa 25.2 release. Most notable is removing the Gallium Nine code that was deprecated earlier this year as what was a Direct3D 9 state tracker for Gallium3D drivers. Gallium Nine was very interesting years ago but these days DXVK for D3D9 and later atop the Vulkan API is much more performant, works for non-Mesa drivers too, and is actively maintained. Gallium Nine has suffered from bit-rot and now has been removed. Removing Gallium Nine lightens up the Mesa codebase by some nearly 40k lines of code.

Also removed for Mesa 25.2 is deleting the deprecated Gallium XA code that was used for X.Org Server acceleration and originally started by VMware for pairing with their DDX driver. XA hasn't been relevant in years and GLAMOR provides better acceleration for the X.Org Server world. Deleting XA lightens Mesa by around 4k lines of code.Mesa 25.2 should be out in August as the next major feature release for these open-source graphics drivers.",https://www.phoronix.com/news/Gallium-Nine-Removed-Mesa,Technology
"Gamers Are Making EA, Take-Two And CDPR Scared To Use AI","GTA 6 Rockstar

This past week, Fortnite introduced an AI Darth Vader using James Earl Jones’ voice to respond to players’ voice chat. It was goofy fun (and in keeping with Jones’ voice rights deal), but AI is not starting to make some large publishers nervous for a few reasons.

Jason Schreier has an excellent article over at Bloomberg highlights that recent reports from big companies like EA and Take-Two have addressed the issue, as have others like CDPR.

On its surface, it seems like GenAI could be used as a tool in games to produce artwork, voice acting, or even game elements themselves. But these companies are starting to realize the very real risks this poses, both legally and “reputationally.”

Take-Two says that the use of AI “presents social and ethical issues that may result in legal and reputational harm and liability.

EA echoes something similar, saying that the use of AI “may result in legal and reputational harm” which would cause players to “lose confidence in our business and brands.”

We’ve already heard aspects of this in the past from fan-favorite developer CDPR as well, which said: “Use of GAI raises many legal concerns, including lack of IPR protection for content on which GAI relies, or potential inadvertent infringement of third-party IPR.”

Cyberpunk 2077 CDPR

So there are two issues here.

1) The legality of GenAI is still in flux. Yes, big tech companies from Google to Meta to OpenAI are blasting forward by training their models on the entire internet, copyrighted work they don’t own. A number of content producers, from the New York Times to musicians and actors are suing various services and there have yet to be any firm decisions about what can or cannot be used with GenAI.

So the issue here would be that if you use AI assets in the game, and rulings come down that this is all now illegal, you’d have to reshape large parts of your game, or even risk legal action yourself if you were wrapped up with all these other entities.

2) “Reputational harm” is a very real thing with gamers right now. When a game is discovered to be using GenAI, it’s roasted online and players deem it “slop” and sometimes will even say they’ll boycott a game because of it. Attach GenAI to your games, which is at this point, not hard to spot, and you risk associating that brand with tech everyone hates, including many of the developers actually making those games, like say, artists or writers that are having their work replaced by “slop.”

Darth Vader Loserfruit

Even with instances like the Darth Vader AI in Fortnite, which is approved of and licensed by the family of James Earl Jones, how does that affect video game voice actors, and there is already a strike going on there where the attempt to license voices to be fed into AI is a core issue.

There may be an aspect of AI more generally to help with development in more technical ways, but GenAI to create art or voicework is an entirely different category and something that as of now, has been roundly rejected by gamers to the point that this kind of things needs to work its way into financial reports. It reminds me of the whole web3/NFT craze that then turned into the metaverse crazy and then they all died because…gamers didn’t want any of that.

AI at large is already reshaping the world, but perhaps gamers can keep this wall up so it doesn’t make it into video games.

Microsoft CPO says she 'fundamentally' disagrees with the idea that people shouldn't study computer science,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Microsoft's CPO Aparna Chennapragada doesn't buy the idea that coding is on its way out.

""A lot of folks think about, 'Oh, don't bother studying computer science or the coding is dead,' and I just fundamentally disagree,"" Chennapragada, the tech giant's chief product officer of experiences and devices, said on ""Lenny's Podcast.""

""If anything, I think we've always had higher and higher layers of abstraction in programming,"" she added.

Despite fears that AI could ultimately render software engineers irrelevant — or at least materially cut down on job openings in the field — Chennapragada believes that AI only adds a further layer of abstraction in the existing process of programming.

""We don't program in assembly anymore,"" she said. ""Most of us don't even program in C, and then you're kind of higher and higher layers of abstraction. So to me, they will be ways that you will tell the computer what to do, right? It'll just be at a much higher level of abstraction, which is great. It democratizes.""

Chennapragada said it was possible that, in the future, we'd think of software engineers more as software operators, but the role itself was unlikely to disappear.

""There'll be an order of magnitude more software operators,"" she said. ""Instead of 'SWEs,' maybe we'll have 'SOs,' but that doesn't mean you don't understand computer science, and it's a way of thinking, and it's a mental model. So I strongly disagree with the whole, 'Coding is dead.'""

As for the fate of project managers, who are subject, like many other middle managers, to Big Tech's ""great flattening,"" Chennapragada expects them to endure, albeit with modified responsibilities. Taste, she said, will be more important than ever.

""In some sense, if you look at it, there's going to be a supply of ideas, a massive increase in supply of ideas in prototypes, which is great,"" Chennapragada said. ""It raises the floor, but it raises the ceiling as well. In some sense, how do you break out in these times that you have to make sure that this is something that rises above the noise?""

Chennapragada didn't respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.

AI makes it easier than ever to actualize an idea, she said, which means that sifting through the glut of ideas will be especially important — so project managers will need to further develop what Chennapragada calls ""the taste-making and the editing"" instincts.

""In a world where the supply of ideas, supply of prototypes becomes even more like an order of magnitude higher, you'd have to think about, 'What is the editing function here?'"" she said.

Because it's so much easier to just get started, Chennapragada says she's observed less of an instinct to automatically turn to a project manager for approval. Though final approval will become more important than ever, she believes PMs have to earn the right to judge.

""There's an interesting side effect I am observing in startups that I'm advising, companies, and even within the companies, that there used to be more gatekeeping, I would say, in terms of like, 'Oh, we should ask the product leader what they think,'"" Chennapragada said. ""And again, there is a role for that editing function, but you have to earn it now.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-cpo-computer-science-degree-coding-important-skills-project-managers-2025-5,Technology

Pakistan emerging as key player in crypto economy: CEO Bilal Bin Saqib,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is establishing itself as a key player in the global cryptocurrency economy and setting trends rather than following them in the digital currency space, Pakistan Crypto Council’s (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib said on Friday.

Mr Saqib told a private news channel that the country is gaining recognition from international tech companies and investors for its growing potential in digital and crypto finance

“For the first time, we are not standing behind the world but we are establishing our own trend in the digital currency landscape,” CEO said. He added, “Global tech leaders and companies are now looking toward Pakistan to explore its crypto potential.”

Mr Saqib emphasised the enthusiasm of Pakistani youth for crypto adoption, suggesting the nation could spearhead digital finance in the region. “Pakistan has the potential to become a regional leader in digital finance, exporting innovation and becoming an epicentre for emerging markets,” he said.

Says country has the potential to become ‘regional leader in digital finance’

He also pointed to the creation of Pakistan’s Digital Assets Authority as a key step towards “strong and smart regulation.”

The objective, Mr Saqib explained, “is to ensure that global-level companies can now be built in Pakistan, not just in the U.S. or Europe.”

PCC chief stressed the importance of empowering Pakistani freelancers and tech followers to become entrepreneurs. “Pakistan is progressing in this space faster than neighbouring countries,” he said, asserting that “the world is recognising our place in the digital economy.”

PSX pares early losses to close flat amid budget concerns,"KARACHI, May 24 — The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recovered much of its early losses by the end of trading on Friday, as cautious optimism emerged after a volatile session dominated by budget-related jitters.

After sliding over 400 points in early trade, the benchmark KSE-100 Index closed at 119,102.67, down just 50.37 points or 0.04%. Earlier in the day, the index had fallen as low as 118,742.59 amid sustained selling pressure driven by investor uncertainty over fiscal measures expected in the upcoming federal budget.

The intraday recovery was supported by selective buying in key blue-chip stocks, though sentiment remained broadly cautious. Market participants are still pricing in the possibility of stringent tax measures and subsidy cuts under the upcoming IMF-guided fiscal roadmap for FY2025-26.

On Thursday, the index had posted a sharper loss of 778 points, reflecting nervousness over potential hikes in capital gains tax, removal of sector-specific tax exemptions, and broader revenue-raising moves as part of the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF).

Despite a recent boost in foreign exchange reserves and the release of a $1.023 billion IMF tranche, traders remained risk-averse, awaiting greater clarity on tax reforms and government spending priorities.

A partial recovery shows that bargain-hunters are active, but the broader market remains in wait-and-watch mode.

SBP injects record Rs12.82 trillion,"Listen to article

In an unprecedented move to help fund the government's fiscal deficit, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) injected a record-breaking Rs12.82 trillion into the banking system on Thursday through Open Market Operations (OMOs), marking one of the largest liquidity injections in recent history.

Of the total injection, Rs12.42 trillion was provided via conventional reverse repo OMOs. This included Rs11.9 trillion through 21-day loans at an interest rate of 11.03%, and Rs521.1 billion through 7-day loans at 11.10%. An additional Rs396 billion was injected using Shariah-compliant Mudarabah-based OMOs, reflecting the SBP's strategy to cater to liquidity needs in both conventional and Islamic banking sectors.

Since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) restricts the government from borrowing directly from the central bank, SBP injects liquidity into commercial banks, which then invest this capital into government treasury instruments, effectively financing the fiscal deficit indirectly, according to sources familiar with the matter.

A revenue shortfall by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is contributing to the funding gap, with actual collections hovering around Rs11.8 trillion against the FY2025 target of Rs12.3 trillion, said Sana Tawfik, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited (AHL). She added that SBP profits of Rs2.5 trillion have already been transferred to the Ministry of Finance in the first nine months of FY2025 as non-tax revenue, while the petroleum levy brought in Rs833 billion during the same period.

Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee gained marginally against the US dollar on Friday, appreciating 0.03% to close at 281.97 in the inter-bank market, up from 282.06 a day earlier.

Gold prices surged in domestic markets in line with global trends as geopolitical risks increased. According to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA), gold per tola jumped Rs3,500 to Rs351,000, while the 10-gram rate increased by Rs3,000 to Rs300,925.

Globally, gold prices rallied 2% on Friday, heading for their best weekly performance in six weeks. This rise was triggered by investor anxiety following US President Donald Trump's renewed threats of imposing steep tariffs, including a 50% levy on European goods, and warning Apple Inc. of further tariffs unless it shifted manufacturing to the US.

""Gold is up today due to strong safe-haven demand,"" said Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities. He noted international gold prices hit a high of $3,364 and hovered around $3,361 per ounce during trading. The market opened at $3,300 and touched a low of $3,286 earlier in the session.",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2547514/sbp-injects-record-rs1282-trillion,Business
Rupee gains on rise in forex reserves,"Foreign currency dealer selling US dollar bills at a money exchange company in Karachi on January 10, 2023. — INP

KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee closed modestly stronger on Friday, aided by positive sentiment due to an over $1 billion increase in foreign exchange reserves. The rupee closed at 281.97 against the US dollar in the interbank market, up from its close at 282.06 in the previous session.

The local unit remained flat in the open market. It traded at 284.15 per dollar, unchanged from the previous session.

Dealers noted that positive sentiment prevailed in the market as Pakistan’s central bank’s foreign exchange reserves rose to a four-month high of $11.45 billion as of May 16. This increase followed the receipt of the second tranche of $1.023 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as part of a $7 billion loan programme. During the reporting week, the reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased by $1.043 billion.

According to analysts, market participants are eagerly monitoring the fiscal year 2025-26 federal budget that will be presented on June 2. “While the government is considering relief measures and sector-specific incentives, any such proposals hinge on the IMF’s approval,” said Chase Securities in a note.

“The Fund is expected to scrutinise the revenue impact of these concessions and seek clarity on how any shortfall will be offset, given the limited avenues available for additional tax collection,” it added.",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1314615-rupee-gains-on-rise-in-forex-reserves,Business

"Oil gains on short-covering, nuclear talks","Published on 05/22/2025 at 20:49, updated on 05/23/2025 at 15:22

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices gained on Friday as U.S. buyers covered positions ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend amid worries over the latest round of nuclear talks between American and Iranian negotiators.

Brent crude futures settled at $64.78 a barrel, up 34 cents, or 0.54%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures finished at $61.53, up 33 cents, or 0.54%.

""I think there is some short-covering going into this weekend,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.

The Memorial Day weekend kicks off the U.S. summer driving season, the period of highest demand for motor fuels.

U.S. and Iranian negotiators met in Rome on Friday in another round of talks aimed at curtailing the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Traders are afraid crude supplies could be interrupted if talks fail to reach a deal, Flynn said.

""The talks are not looking good,"" he said. ""If these are the last talks and there's no deal, it could give a green light to the Israelis to attack Iran.""

President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is recommending a straight 50% tariff on goods from the EU starting on June 1, saying the bloc has been hard to deal with on trade.

""The oil market has been under pressure from two things,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. ""We await the impact of tariffs on oil demand and OPEC+ is expected to increase supply again this summer.""

OPEC+, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia is holding meetings next week expected to yield another output increase of 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) for July.

Reuters reported this month that the group could unwind the rest of its 2.2 million bpd voluntary production cut by the end of October, having already raised output targets by about 1 million bpd for April, May and June.

Health rounds: Researchers identify best drugs for severe Covid,"A member of the medical personnel works at a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing site which is temporarily set up at a railway station in Seoul, South Korea, December 15, 2020. — Reuters

A class of drugs known as Janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitors, which work by slowing down the immune system, should be the first-line therapy for patients hospitalised for Covid-19, researchers reported in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

The researchers analysed individual outcomes of nearly 13,000 adults hospitalised for Covid who participated in 16 randomised trials comparing JAK inhibitors to other drugs or placebos between May 2020 and March 2022.

Overall, 11.7% of patients who received JAK inhibitors died by day 28, compared with 13.2% of those who received other treatments such as the steroid dexamethasone or medications that block the signalling of the inflammatory protein IL-6.

After accounting for individual risk factors, the odds of death by day 28 were 33% lower in the JAK inhibitor group.

“These results should inform World Health Organisation Covid-19 treatment guidelines, both in the USA and Europe,” an editorial published with the study said. “Although the pandemic has passed and Covid-19 is not nearly as rampant as it was previously, delays in disseminating and adopting best-evidence treatment practices can only be harmful.”

JAK inhibitors include Pfizer’s Xeljanz (tofacitinib), Eli Lilly’s Olumiant (baricitinib), and AbbVie’s Rinvoq (upadacitinib).

JAK inhibitors also decreased the need for new mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support, and allowed for faster discharge from hospital by about 1 day, with fewer serious adverse events.

The findings were true regardless of patients’ Covid vaccination status.

“The certainty of the authors’ conclusion that JAK inhibitory therapy for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital for Covid-19 provides a significant mortality benefit is further supported when the analysis is limited to placebo-controlled studies,” the editorial says.

For very large fetuses, early induction may be beneficial

When a near-term fetus is expected to be larger than most other newborns at birth, it might be safer to induce labour a bit ahead of the due date, new data suggest.

Births of large babies can be complicated by shoulder dystocia, an emergency situation in which their shoulders become impacted on the mother's pubic bones after their head has emerged, preventing the rest of the body from being delivered spontaneously.

To see if inducing labour ahead of schedule would reduce the risk of shoulder dystocia, researchers recruited 2,893 women whose fetuses appeared on ultrasound to be larger than 90% of other similarly-aged fetuses.

They randomly assigned the women to receive standard care or induction between 38 weeks and 38-weeks-and-four-days of gestation. Induction was expected to result in an earlier birth and a lower birth weight than standard care.

Overall, in the so-called Big Baby Trial, there was no difference between the groups in rates of shoulder dystocia, probably because many of the women in the standard care group delivered before 38 weeks, and so their babies were smaller than predicted.

When the analysis was limited to women who did not deliver before 38 weeks, shoulder dystocia occurred in 2.3% of babies in the induction group versus 3.7% of those in the standard care group.

The induction group delivered on average about 8 days earlier, and their babies weighed about 8 ounces (213 grams) less, compared to the usual-care group.

After accounting for individual risk factors, the odds of shoulder dystocia were 38% lower in the induction group versus usual care in women whose pregnancies lasted beyond 38 weeks.

Induction of labour was also associated with a lower likelihood of cesarean delivery and fewer maternal complications, researchers reported in The Lancet.

An editorial published with the report notes, “The Big Baby Trial joins an accumulating body of literature... indicating that induction of labour either does not alter or might reduce the risk for needing cesarean delivery” when a larger fetus is suspected.

New bed net treatment targets malaria parasites in mosquitoes

Bed nets may once again become useful against malaria in endemic regions, with use of a chemical that targets the malaria-causing parasite in mosquitoes rather than the mosquitoes themselves, researchers reported on Wednesday in Nature.

The use of long-lasting insecticides in bed nets significantly reduced malaria cases and deaths between 2000 and 2015, but the method eventually became less effective due to the rise of insecticide resistance.

The researchers from the Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health in Boston screened 81 endochin-like quinolones (ELQs), a class of experimental antimalarial agents, and identified two that block the development of the malaria parasite by targeting a key protein in the parasite.

The ELQs were effective even against mosquitoes that were resistant to traditional insecticides.

“Malaria control desperately needs innovation,” study co-author Dr Flaminia Catteruccia said in a statement.

“Our chemistry collaborators at Oregon Health and Science University were able to generate these compounds inexpensively, which would allow this approach to be integrated into existing bed net infrastructure at a competitive cost,” study leader Alexandra Probst said in a statement.",https://www.geo.tv/latest/605933-health-rounds-researchers-identify-best-drugs-for-severe-covid,Business

AI and the UAE,"WHEN US President Donald Trump descended on the Middle East last week, he brought with him the CEOs of a host of American tech companies. These included Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Palantir’s Alex Karp and many others. These CEOs got the chance to get close to those who rule Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar and negotiate deals. This led to what Trump loves best: the announcement of multibillion-dollar tech deals for US companies.

Money was at the heart of all this — America is, after all, a capitalist machine, and must be fed cold hard cash. At the same time, this was also a strategic victory for the US in its competition with China in the realm of AI. One deal that was finalised between Abu Dhabi and American AI giant OpenAI illustrates this. The deal was made to establish one of the world’s largest AI hubs in Abu Dhabi, with an investment of up to $500bn in infrastructure and projects. The planned facility will reportedly span over 25 square kilometres and require power equal to five nuclear reactors.

The story of how Abu Dhabi got here is interesting against the backdrop of international relations, strategy and the US-China stand-off over AI. The UAE project has been developed in conjunction with an Abu Dhabi-based tech conglomerate G42 and is a part of OpenAI’s Stargate project, which hopes to set up similar hubs all around the world. However, until recently, the US had not trusted G42 with OpenAI’s pioneering AI technology.

In 2023, G42 was headed by an executive of Chinese-origin, a fact that was brought up by the CIA when a UAE official visited the White House in 2023. It was also underscored that G42 had relationships with Chinese intelligence outfits.

Pakistanis should worry about AI’s move to the Gulf.

All this changed when G42’s new CEO announced that the company had almost entirely divested from China. With China out of the picture and the Gulf leaders interested in deploying AI for their own purposes, the market was well and truly opened for OpenAI. Therefore, last week when Trump traipsed into Abu Dhabi, he and OpenAI were also at the helm of a strategic victory. Whatever divestment the UAE had enabled from China, it appears to have been enough to mollify US concerns about the leak of AI technology into China. The stage was set for the unveiling of a massive data hub.

So the UAE (the Saudis and Qataris have arranged their own deals) is going to be the largest AI data hub in the region. It is also indicative of the hopes that Emirati rulers harbour about the use of AI within their professional and social environments.

It is well known that the UAE has an enormous guest-worker population that fills both low-skill construction and similar job slots and high-skill white-collar positions such as those in engineering and technology. The shift to AI could well make the UAE far less dependent on these migrant populations.

According to AI experts, jobs such as those of cashiers, data entry clerks, truckers and delivery people on the low-skilled end will vanish in the AI-led future. Similarly, software engineers and developers and other such tech workers will likely also be replaced by computers that can write code faster and with greater accuracy. Doctors, particularly those in specialised areas of medicine, such as radiology and pathology, could see their jobs disappear as computers analyse far more data about a patient’s condition and produce more accurate diagnosis than they ever can.

This move towards AI in the Gulf is something that Pakistanis need to be concerned about. Pakistan re­­lies on exporting blue-collar and whi­te-collar workers to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia and remittances from these workers are a crucial part of the country’s economy. They determine how people think of their children’s future and their education and the courses of study that young people choose to pursue. While Pakistan may not have deep AI penetration or even development in our local market at present, this is not the case for the global arena where we go to work.

Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries have, for a long time now, seen migrant labour as a problem to be solved, and they may have hit upon a solution that serves them well. All the subcontinental faces that one sees on visits to Riyadh and Dubai may see their days in these Arab places numbered once the new AI future of the Middle East, as envisioned by its rulers, is realised. In their view, if migrant workers can be replaced with AI, their countries can be reclaimed for their true natural-born citizens. The question is, what will countries like Pakistan do for their own citizens in a future where their export to labour markets in the Gulf will become a vastly limited option?

DUBAI/NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Saudi state oil giant Aramco is exploring potential asset sales to free up funds, two people with knowledge of the matter said, as it pursues an international expansion and weathers lower crude prices.

Aramco (2223.SE) , opens new tab is the world's largest oil-producing company and the main source of Saudi state revenue. The firm will slash dividend payouts by nearly a third this year as lower oil prices hit its income.

The company has asked investment bankers to pitch ideas for how to raise funds from its assets, the people said.

They declined to say which assets could be sold or name the banks involved.

Aramco declined to comment.

Aramco is looking to improve efficiency and cut costs, according to two other people with knowledge of the matter, and an option under consideration would be asset sales, one of them said. The four sources declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to media.

Aramco is the engine of the Saudi economy and its sprawling business includes units for aviation, construction and sports. It has retained majority stakes during previous asset sales such as its deals around its pipeline infrastructure.

The Saudi government is putting pressure on its industries to improve profitability amid low crude prices and as it spends its hydrocarbon wealth on new sectors to cut reliance on oil.

The kingdom faces a widening budget deficit with the International Monetary Fund saying Riyadh needs a price of oil of over $90 per barrel to balance its books compared to prices of around $60 per barrel in recent weeks.

Aramco has in recent years made a push to grow its global footprint, including investing in Chinese refineries, Chilean fuel retailer Esmax (ESMAX.O) , opens new tab and U.S.-headquartered LNG firm MidOcean

The Saudi company said last week it signed 34 preliminary deals potentially worth up to $90 billion with U.S. firms following President Donald Trump's visit to the kingdom.

"Nvidia to launch cheaper Blackwell AI chip for China after U.S. export curbs, sources say","Nvidia will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.

The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.

The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.

It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.

They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's 2330.TW advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.

Summary

Companies Nvidia faces potential AI spending cuts from major cloud firms

Company aims to expand AI market grip through NVLink Fusion

Taiwan's tech ecosystem crucial for Nvidia's growth

TAIPEI, May 23 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang flew out of Taipei on Friday after a week revelling in the adoration of Taiwan's tech industry, and delivering a subtle but crucial message from the U.S. AI chip king on how it plans to keep its crown.

While 'Jensanity' swirled around Huang at the Computex trade fair, Nvidia itself was at a crossroads. Having grown to become the world's most valuable chip company, investors fear a drop in spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as damage to sales from U.S. trade friction

Sign up here.

U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports have seen Nvidia lose market share in China as it withdraws chips and designs inferior alternatives compliant with evolving U.S. policy.

Now, cloud computing giants such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) , opens new tab and Alphabet's Google have signalled cuts to AI spending. And while the 62-year old CEO has in the past month announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars in regions such as the Gulf, analysts said such deals are likely to become scarce.

""Is every country going to announce a $10 billion or $50 billion data centre like the Saudis? Of course not,"" said Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg. ""They're sort of running out of obvious deals.""

When asked by Reuters how Nvidia planned to deal with AI spending slowdown, Huang said, ""AI infrastructure is being built out (everywhere) - that's one of the reasons I'm travelling around the world... AI infrastructure is going to be a part of society.""

NEW GROWTH

At Computex, Huang revealed a means of growth that does not rely on mega sovereign infrastructure arrangements: new technology that expands Nvidia's grip on the AI market.

The tech's centrepiece is called NVLink Fusion. It allows companies to plug custom chips into Nvidia's AI infrastructure, thereby becoming a platform upon which others can build.

""Instead of having to build the entire rack of equipment themselves, (companies) could innovate or differentiate on the custom (chip) itself,"" said Nick Kucharewski, vice president at Marvell Technology (MRVL.O) , opens new tab

The bet is that drawing companies to build hardware that utilises Nvidia's Fusion platform will drive demand for the underlying AI network and data centre parts that Nvidia sells.

Nvidia has also begun to reach into the enterprise market. This week, it launched a line of servers that Huang described as an ""enterprise AI supercomputer"".

Huang's pitch was that the servers open up a multi-billion dollar market because customers can use them for ""everything"", such as graphics, virtual machines and AI applications.

The enterprise market is large but difficult to break into, said Seaport Research's Goldberg. Deals tend to be small - compared with a sovereign data centre - and more expensive and time-consuming to win.

""My sense is we're sort of bumping up against the limits of expanding the customer base,"" Goldberg said.

TAIWAN ECOSYSTEM

Nvidia works with some of Taiwan's biggest names in tech, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) , opens new tab , which makes many of its chips. However, the underlying infrastructure for AI would not be possible without the hundreds of Taiwanese companies big and small supplying components and manufacturing know-how needed to construct Nvidia's complex AI systems.

""The purpose of Computex was to bring together the ecosystem and the supply chain,"" said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at consultancy More Than Moore.

Such a network is necessary to support the deals announced in the Gulf and that are likely coming elsewhere in the world in the coming months, Cutress said.

Taiwanese industry has embraced Huang, who is perceived as a local-born hero hailing from Taiwan's historic capital of Tainan before migrating to the U.S. when he was nine years old.

By the time he flew out on Friday, Huang had appeared on stage or at banquets with nearly every prominent Taiwanese tech executive, including Chairman Young Liu of AI server builder Foxconn (2317.TW) , opens new tab who called him the ""leader of Team Taiwan"".

MediaTek (2454.TW) , opens new tab CEO Rick Tsai gave Huang chunks of guava in a plastic bag from the Nvidia leader's favoured fruit stall in Taipei during one of the chip designer's events.

Solomon Technology (2359.TW) , opens new tab , a provider of industrial automation and AI-based inspection solutions which uses Nvidia's software tools, said working with Nvidia is a win-win situation.

Shares of Solomon have surged 241% since Huang mentioned the firm at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in March last year.

""The collaboration with Nvidia has given us greater visibility. We weren't very well-known before, but with Nvidia's support, many more people know us now,"" said Solomon Chairman Johnny Chen.

Global Travel & Tourism to Reach New Heights in 2025,"Saudi Arabia Set for Record SAR 447BN Economic Boost



Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: The World Travel & Tourism Council’s ( WTTC ) is forecasting that international visitor spending will break all previous records this year, reaching an unprecedented $2.1TN - $164BN more than the 2019 peak.



The sector’s total global economic contribution is set to reach $11.7TN this year, 10.3% of global GDP, while jobs supported by the sector are expected to rise by 14MN, reaching 371MN worldwide, more than the entire population of the U.S.



But while the sector is surging overall, momentum in some major economies is slowing.



According to the research, the U.S., still the world’s largest Travel & Tourism market, continues to lag, with international visitor spend trailing 2019 levels. In China, while international spending was above pre-pandemic levels last year, growth is expected to slow sharply in 2025.





Saudi Arabia Surges Ahead

Against this backdrop, Saudi Arabia is writing its own success story. WTTC’s latest data shows Travel & Tourism is expected to inject SAR 447.2BN into the economy this year - a new record and a bold statement of intent from one of the world’s fastest-growing destinations.



Travel & Tourism is set to contribute more than 10% of Saudi Arabia’s GDP in 2025, with sector employment projected to reach an all-time high of 2.7MN.



This success is fuelled by impressive levels of international and domestic spending, with inbound visitor spending forecast to hit almost SAR 200BN this year, whilst domestic spending is also expected to soar to a record SAR 162.5BN.



Saudi Arabia is fast becoming a global tourism powerhouse.





A Sector Transformed



Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said “Thanks to the leadership of His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Saudi Arabia's Travel & Tourism sector is not just growing, it’s thriving.

The Kingdom is redefining what’s possible, and will not only meet, but exceed the ambitions of Vision 2030.”

Like any other technological advancement, aircraft evolution has long been driven by innovations in material science. In the pursuit of progress, once relegated to secondary roles, polymers and composite matrices are now emerging as central players in designing and manufacturing modern aircraft, drones and satellites.

The inherent limitations of traditional metals and alloys are becoming increasingly apparent as they struggle to meet the evolving demands of next-generation aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For instance, the widely utilised aluminium alloy 7075, employed in legacy fighters like the F-16 Fighting Falcon, offers commendable strength but is prone to fatigue and corrosion when exposed to the extreme conditions of modern flight, often necessitating costly maintenance and premature component replacement.

Similarly, titanium alloys, which play a pivotal role in high-performance platforms such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, deliver excellent strength-to-weight ratios but come with high production costs and complex machining challenges that limit their scalability, particularly in cost-sensitive UAV applications like the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. Moreover, traditional high-strength steels, though beneficial in specific structural components of older UAV designs, struggle to balance stiffness, weight reduction, and enhanced thermal management.

These limitations underscore the need for a paradigm shift toward advanced organic polymers and composite materials. These materials offer significant weight reductions and superior durability and provide the adaptability required to meet the extreme operational demands of future aerospace technologies. They also bring the added benefits of lower costs, improved energy efficiency, compliance with environmental regulations, and accelerated aircraft manufacturing. For instance, carbon nanotube–reinforced epoxy composites, utilised in platforms like the MQ-9 Reaper, significantly extend flight endurance by reducing drag and maintenance requirements. They also enable intricate design capabilities and machining complexities that titanium alloys cannot achieve.

In military aviation, specialised composites incorporating radar-absorbing materials and ballistic-resistant layers significantly enhance survivability in hostile environments. Notable examples include the F-35 Lightning II, which employs carbon fibre composites and radar-absorbing materials to reduce its radar cross-section for stealth operations drastically. Similarly, the B-2 Spirit bomber is designed with advanced polymer composites, providing superior stealth capabilities and extended operational endurance.

Despite the advantages of polymers and composites, their reliance on petrochemicals remains a significant challenge, contributing to a carbon footprint that conflicts with global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. Encouragingly, innovations like Lignik and polyethylene furanoate are driving groundbreaking advancements in engineering polymers made from CO2 and agricultural waste, offering a sustainable alternative that supports climate change mitigation and preserves these materials' inherent strengths.

Pakistan stands at a pivotal crossroads, as the global shift toward advanced materials presents a unique opportunity to redefine its aviation and technology sectors. With abundant agricultural resources but limited mining and metal refining industries, the country has the potential to leapfrog directly into the era of high-performance polymers and composites, bypassing traditional metallurgical dependencies. By embracing these cutting-edge materials, Pakistan can fast-track the development of next-generation jets while expanding its industrial capabilities to include vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, UAVs and even satellites – positioning itself at the forefront of aerospace innovation.

Achieving this ambitious vision requires a comprehensive, multisectoral approach encompassing polymer production, additive manufacturing and aerospace engineering. To reach market-scale production, Pakistan must broaden its focus beyond aeronautics and invest in engineering polymers with applications across multiple industries. Key materials include polyamides, polyimides, polyetherimides, polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), carbon fibres and epoxies. PEEK and PEKK, reinforced with carbon fibres, are revolutionising aircraft design, exemplified by the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350, which incorporate composite fuselage structures that drastically reduce weight and enhance fatigue resistance compared to traditional aluminum alloys like 7075.

Additive manufacturing will play a crucial role in this transformation, as polymers and composites enable 3D printing, reduce production costs, and accelerate manufacturing. For example, Aurora Flight Sciences developed the world’s first jet-powered, 3D-printed UAV using a polyetherimide matrix, showcasing its potential.

Further advancements in aerospace engineering are essential for optimising polymer and composite materials across a broader range of final products. OneWeb Satellites provides broadband internet via low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, which use polymer-based materials to optimise weight and thermal resistance. Similarly, the Bell V-280 Valor, a next-generation VTOL aircraft, incorporates thermoplastic composite ruddervators and compression-moulded access panels, enhancing durability, reducing weight, and improving production efficiency. Interestingly, both LEO satellites and VTOL aircraft have military and commercial applications, making them highly attractive for further development.

Developing a composite-driven aerospace industry in Pakistan requires a strategic, multipronged approach. With a strong foundation in aeronautical engineering, Pakistan must now focus on upskilling in composite materials and additive manufacturing. Collaboration with global institutions and investment in local R&D centres is essential. As Aurora Flight Sciences demonstrated, additive manufacturing reduces the need for heavy infrastructure. However, the polymer sector remains untapped and demands government support to build a skilled workforce.

By developing local expertise, Pakistan can establish a full aerospace supply chain – from raw materials to advanced components. Strategic investment in composites, additive manufacturing, and engineering will reduce foreign reliance, boost national security, and enable the development of indigenous aircraft, satellites and UAVs.

Mountain marvel: how one of biggest batteries in Europe uses thousands of gallons of water to stop blackouts,"Seconds after a catastrophic series of power outages struck across the UK in the summer of 2019, a phone rang in the control room of the Dinorwig hydropower plant in north Wales. It was Britain’s energy system operator requesting an immediate deluge of electricity to help prevent a wide-scale blackout crippling Britain’s power grids.

The response was swift, and in the end just under one million people were left without power for less than 45 minutes. While trains were stuck on lines for hours and hospitals had to revert to backup generators, that phone call prevented Britain’s worst blackout in a decade from being far more severe.

Almost six years later, the owners of Dinorwig, and its sister plant at Ffestiniog on the boundary of Eryri national park, formerly Snowdonia, are preparing to pump up to £1bn into a 10-year refurbishment of the hydropower plants that have quietly helped to keep the lights on for decades.

Ffestiniog was one of the first pumped hydroelectric systems in the UK when it opened in 1963, while nearby Dinorwig – the largest and fastest-acting pumped storage station in Europe – followed in 1984. The refurbishment could mean the plants continue to provide reliable clean energy on demand for decades to come – and serve as giant grid batteries to store Britain’s renewable electricity for when it is needed most.

Miya Paolucci, the UK boss of the French energy company Engie, one of Dinorwig’s owners, said refurbishing the plant will cost a third of the investment needed to build a new hydropower plant on a similar scale, making the overhaul an “intuitive” decision to secure another 25 years of life from the “much-loved” power station.

Britain has used gravity and the flow of water to generate electricity since 1878, when a hydroelectric generator first powered an arc lamp at the Cragside manor house in Northumberland. The project involved dropping water 100 metres vertically to turn a Siemens generator that would go on to power a series of newly invented incandescent lightbulbs in the country house.

Dinorwig and Ffestiniog use the same principles as the Cragside manor house to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of almost 2 million UK households in a matter of seconds. When power is plentiful, the plants use electricity to pump water from a lower reservoir up to an elevated dam. Later, when power supplies are tight, the water is released to drive the turbines, generating power.

Dinorwig or Mynydd Gwefru, as it is known locally, can be called upon to generate electricity within 75 seconds by releasing 86,000 gallons of water a second down a cavernous 500-metre vertical tunnel. The water crashes into six turbines, each weighing about 500 tonnes, which generate high-volume blasts of renewable power on demand.

Overall, hydropower makes up only 2% of the UK’s total electricity – but often at times when its electrons are at their most vital to keeping the lights on. It provides many of the key benefits of large fossil fuel power plants – but without the carbon emissions.

Unlike wind and solar farms, hydropower projects can be called upon by the system operator at specific times when the grid needs more generation to meet demand. The spinning mass of its generators can also help to stabilise the frequency of the power grid at about 50Hz, the level required to avoid power outages. In the event of a blackout, hydropower can even help to restart the power system.

But after 140 years generating electricity it is hydropower’s potential as an energy storage technology that is key to its future. Pumped hydropower can effectively work as a long-duration battery by using renewable electricity when it is abundant to pump water up into a reservoir and release the water to generate electricity when renewable energy wanes.

Unlike grid batteries, which are often designed to charge during the day and discharge electricity at night, long-duration energy storage systems can store energy for hours, days or even weeks so it can be used when needed.

The government hopes to bring forward investment in 18GW of storage by 2035, of which 10GW should be long-duration storage such as hydropower. But pumped hydropower projects are struggling to find a place in Britain’s energy landscape

View image in fullscreen The control room at Dinorwig power station. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian

There are geographic hurdles: there are only so many vast mountains and brimming reservoirs, and the projects can also provoke concerns within the local community. But in locations where they are viable developers have been left to wait for government officials to confirm the details of its financial support framework.

One of the UK’s biggest renewable energy developers, SSE, hopes that its Coire Glas project in the Scottish Highlands could be the first major pumped storage hydro scheme built in the UK in more than 40 years.

The project could power 3 million homes for up to 24 hours, and would nearly double Great Britain’s total current electricity storage capacity, but it needs the final details of a government support scheme before SSE can fully commit to the project.

A House of Lords report published late last year warned that a large-scale rollout of long-duration energy storage technologies was “not being treated with sufficient urgency”.

The report found that a wide-scale rollout would allow more renewable power to be available, potentially lowering the overall cost of electricity for consumers.

Better energy storage could, the committee said, make the grid more flexible and avoid paying to switch off wind and solar farms when there is more clean power being generated than consumers can use.

Paolucci said: “Flexible storage is essential for net zero carbon operation of Britain’s electricity system. It helps balance the system by ensuring there’s always a large volume of ‘back-up’ power on standby, that can be delivered in very fast timescales if required. We’re very proud to contribute to the electricity security of supply and green energy ambition of the UK with these extraordinary assets.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/24/europe-battery-gallons-water-dinorwig-wales,Business
Expert calls Musk’s ‘Doge’ involvement ‘one of the greatest brand destructions’,"The prominent US marketing professor Scott Galloway says Elon Musk’s decision to implement brutal job and spending cuts within the federal government on behalf of the Trump administration was “one of the greatest brand destructions” ever.

Speaking on Friday’s episode of the popular Pivot podcast, which he co-hosts, Galloway said Trump’s billionaire businessman adviser alienated the customer base of his electrical vehicle manufacturer Tesla – one of his most important holdings – while aligning himself with a president whose allies aren’t interested in the kinds of cars the company makes.

Galloway then cited polling which suggested Tesla had fallen from the eighth-most reputable brand in 2021 to 95th.

“He’s alienated the wrong people,” Galloway remarked. “Three-quarters of Republicans would never consider buying an EV. So he’s cozied up to the people who aren’t interested in EVs.”

Galloway also rattled off figures maintaining that Tesla’s sales were down 59% in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 66% in Denmark, 50% in Switzerland and 33% in Portugal.

Musk in recent months had sought to intervene in various European political affairs in recent months, including Germany’s federal election and the UK’s row over grooming gangs – particularly on X, the social media platform he owns.

After meddling put off many in Europe, a lucrative EV market, Tesla’s Chinese competitor BYD outsold the Austin-based company on the continent for the first time ever in April, according to a report from Jato Dynamics, which supplies automotive industry intelligence.

“This has arguably been one of the greatest brand destructions,” Galloway said to his co-host, veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher. “Tesla was a great brand.

“He’s alienated his core demographic.”

The federal job and spending cuts attributed to Musk stem from his involvement leading the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) during Trump’s second US presidency, which began in January. Musk landed the role after his super political action committee donated $200m to Trump’s successful run in November to return to the White House after he lost the 2020 election as the incumbent.

Opinion polling since has suggested strong disapproval of the work Musk has done for Trump, including some research showing a majority of voters disliked the way the businessman and Doge had dealt with federal government employees in particular as the department slashed jobs.

Toward the end of April, Tesla was reporting a 71% dip in profits – and, on an earnings call with Tesla investors, Musk said he would start pulling back from his role at Doge beginning in May.

Musk said his work getting the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done” and therefore his “time allocation to Doge will drop significantly”.

One nonpartisan research group, the Partnership for Public Service, estimated in late April that about $160bn in cuts touted by Doge were on track to cost roughly $135bn.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/24/elon-musk-doge-scott-galloway,Business
Six solutions for clinical study data sharing in Germany - BMC Medical Research Methodology,"Funders, institutions, and policy makers strongly encourage researchers to share their data, allowing others to validate results and explore new questions. Data reuse avoids unnecessary duplication, permits meta-analyses, and honors patients’ contributions, including the burdens and risks of study participation. Funders and journals are increasingly making data sharing mandatory [1,2,3]. Patients and healthy volunteers want their data to be shared and utilized, to benefit their patient group and society at large [4, 5]. Shared clinical study data is frequently reused and demonstrably improves health research through trial reanalysis [6, 7], meta-analysis [8], and methods development [9]. The value of reusable data is increasing with the advent of artificial intelligence and data spaces, such as the European Health Data Space. However, thus far, only a small subset of existing clinical data has been shared, and thus clinical research fails to harness the transformative power of shared data. A comprehensive meta-analysis has shown that only 2% of research articles in medical and health science share underlying data [10]. Here, we argue that this sharing crisis demands immediate action by various stakeholders. As remedy we propose six feasible actions to boost the availability of clinical study data in Germany.

Our experiences are based on consulting in over 50 cases with regard to diverse aspects of data sharing, including consent and de-identification, data quality and usability, and sharing venues and processes. In these cases, where researchers at one of the largest University Medical Centers in Europe wanted to share clinical study data, confirm that potential data providers in Germany face many obstacles. Thus, it is unsurprising that data sharing rates are very low. Despite widely observed high motivation from researchers to share valuable data, very few datasets were ultimately shared. The few datasets that were shared were subjected to protracted, time-consuming agreements to achieve legal compliance. Data minimization procedures introduced during this process substantially reduced the potential for reuse, while legal liability still resided with data creators. As we experienced repeatedly in our consulting, it was not just researchers at our own institution who abandoned their data sharing ambitions due to frustrations with the complex red tape and the discrepancy between political expectations and on-the-ground impossibilities. Germany’s stringent data protection laws have made sharing medical research data challenging, leading to frustrations among international collaborators, including German researchers abroad. These complexities could be a contributing factor in Germany’s declining participation in global clinical research [11]. The German Medical Research act (Medizinforschungsgesetz [12]), which came into effect on October 2024, is in part designed to address this issue.

The lack of legal harmonization and its downstream consequences are the primary obstacle to clinical data sharing in the EU [13], and this is all the more true for Germany. While the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) offers a useful legal framework to protect the personal data of individuals, the current interpretation and handling of GDPR in Germany creates high bureaucratic burdens and, even more detrimental, legal uncertainty. This complexity and uncertainty associated with data sharing is further compounded by clinical investigators potentially bearing sole responsibility [14] for any future legal consequences resulting from their decision to share data. Ultimately, this prevents clinical data sharing for the good of patients as an unintended consequence. In contrast, discussions with Austrian and Dutch stakeholders, who also operate under the GPDR, demonstrated that institutional and national infrastructures can facilitate clinical data sharing. Such proven best practices need to be transferred to the German clinical research landscape to avoid being left behind.",https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-025-02560-y,Business
Rising bond yields give stock-market investors the yips. Watch these levels.,"By William Watts

President Donald Trump ended the week on a grumpy note, rattling his tariff saber - and stock-market investors - on Friday as he threatened levies on Apple Inc. and the European Union. But for all the renewed trade drama, it was moves in the bond market that have been the center of attention.

Specifically, it was a sharp move higher this week in the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y, which on Thursday hit 5.15%, just shy of its intraday high from October 2023 near 5.17%, before falling back, that was front and center. It ended Friday at 5.036%, up 14.1 basis points for the week and has risen nearly 30 basis points over the last four weeks, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Yields and bond prices move opposite each other.

The S&P 500 SPX on Tuesday snapped a six-day winning streak, falling for the next four sessions to log a 2.6% weekly decline, its steepest since the week ended April 4. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 2.5% for the week.

Wary investors fear yields are rising to levels that could spell further pain for stocks and other assets.

The rise was tied to jitters around Trump-backed tax and spending legislation, which he has dubbed the ""big, beautiful bill,"" which eked out passage by a single vote this week. The bill is seen adding to a deficit that was already causing agita, with its passage coming just after Moody's last Friday stripped the U.S. of its last triple-A credit rating, citing expectations U.S. deficits and interest payments on existing debt are sure to continue rising in the years ahead after decades of fiscal neglect.

A poorly received 20-year U.S. Treasury bond auction on Wednesday amplified the concerns on Wednesday, highlighting worries over demand in the face of rising supply. The jump in Treasury yields spilled over to stocks, leaving major indexes sharply lower.

""Bond investors worry about Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax bill and the impact it will have on the U.S. overall deficit. You should too,"" said Giuseppe Sette, co-founder and president of AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email.

He acknowledged that investors have largely looked past burgeoning deficits and other fiscal concerns for years, but warned of a potential inflection point that could reinvigorate the so-called bond-market vigilantes who have from time to time exercised de facto veto power over profligate governments.

""Markets are a matter of alternative, they are inherently cross-sectional and cross-asset. When the longer bonds start to look like 5% yield with modest inflation two things can happen - greedy investors reassess their equity position to get more fixed income carry, and spooked investors reassess their equity position to go into cash,"" Sette wrote.

""Either way, equity positions stand out in the current environment. And if equity goes down, so do most other risk markets - commodities, crypto, high-yield currencies.""

10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y yields also rose, pushing above 4.60% - the highest since mid-February - before pulling back to end the week at 4.508%. The yield rose 7.1 basis points for the week and more than 24 basis points over the last four weeks.

A 10-year yield above 4.5% has historically been a problem for investor sentiment, said Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, in a Friday note, observing that the level also coincides with a 7% 30-year mortgage rate, which could put additional strain on housing demand and activity in the broader economy.

Moreover, stock-market valuations tend to move inversely to interest rates, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio struggling to expand, or even contracting, when the 10-year yield moves above 4.5%.

""A move toward 4.75% would be even more concerning, as equities have typically underperformed at that level,"" he wrote. ""Taken together - with rising yields and the likelihood of further downward in consensus EPS estimates - we believe our more cautious stance on equities is justified.""

The rise in real, or inflation-adjusted, longtime yields was also raising concern because it's coming at the same time economists are marking down expectations for economic growth. ""This is new, and much more concerning than in past yield spikes linked to strong growth"" and perceptions that the Federal Reserve would be inclined toward tightening monetary policy, noted economist Jens Nordvig, founder of Exante Data, in a LinkedIn post earlier this week.

That would imply that bond investors are growing increasingly uncomfortable with the fiscal situation in the U.S. and the lack of political will in Washington to take steps to reduce the debt.

Rising long-term yields weren't just a U.S. phenomenon. Long-term Japanese yields also surged. The move shows the bond-vigilante phenomenon isn't confined to the U.S.

Read: Bond 'vigilantes' are sending warnings globally. What does that mean for your portfolio?

""Duration risk is going global, fiscal complacency is being repriced in real time, and the illusion of harmony between stocks and rates is starting to fracture,"" Stephen Innes, a managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a Tuesday note that captured the mood.

By the end of the week, U.S. as well as Japanese yields, had moved off their earlier highs. For some investors, the spike was noteworthy, but not sufficient to ring alarm bells.

Veteran technical analyst Mark Arbeter of Arbeter Investments, found it curious that investors and financial media were paying such close attention to the 30-year bond when the yield on the 10-year Treasury note is much more closely followed and relevant to economic activity.

""Maybe because it got above 5% before the 10-year did, that would be my guess,"" he said, in a phone interview.

Arbeter argued that the move in the 30-year didn't yet qualify as a technical breakout. That would take a move back above the late 2023 high over 5.15%. If a sustained breakout too place it could take the yield to the 6% to 6.4% range.

That would also mean a big rise in the 10-year yield. For stocks, however, the key would be less the level than the speed of the move, Arbeter said.

""If it's a slow, steady grind higher, that's OK, the stock market can digest that type of move in yields,"" he said. ""If we wake up tomorrow and yields are up 20 or 30 basis points and the velocity of yields increases, then the market's going to have a problem.""

Aldosterone synthase inhibitor offers hope for treatment of uncontrolled hypertension,"Lorundrostat, a novel therapy which blocks the production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained reductions in blood pressure in 1,083 patients with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension, according to the results of a phase 3 trial announced today.

The data from the Launch-HTN trial, announced at the 34th European Meeting on Hypertension and Cardiovascular Protection, show that lorundrostat, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, is a safe and effective treatment for people with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension, demonstrating consistent blood pressure reductions across a large and diverse patient population. It is the largest phase three trial of an aldosterone synthase inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension.

The results are a major milestone toward delivering the first targeted aldosterone synthase inhibitor treatment for uncontrolled or resistant hypertension, which could benefit millions of people affected by the conditions.

Dr. Manish Saxena, Clinical Co-Director of Queen Mary University of London's William Harvey Heart Centre and Hypertension Specialist at Barts Health NHS Trust, is the study's lead investigator. He said:

""Despite available treatments, more than 40% of adults with hypertension worldwide are not reaching their blood pressure goal. There's a major need to explore novel therapies for hypertension and the Launch-HTN trial addressed this need.

""Aldosterone pathway plays important role in blood pressure regulation, and leads to blood pressure related complications such as heart failure and kidney problems. In the Launch-HTN trial, we explored the safety and effectiveness of lorundostat, which belongs to a new class of drugs called aldosterone synthase inhibitors that block production of hormone aldosterone from the adrenal glands.

""The Launch-HTN trial is the largest phase 3 hypertension study with a novel drug. We tested lorundostat in a large, diverse patient population recruited globally, and found that it has a good safety profile and lowered blood pressure consistently in our patient groups. Once commercially available, lorundostat could be novel treatment option for hypertension in millions of patients worldwide.""

Hypertension affects 1 in 3 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke.

30% of people with hypertension have dysregulated aldosterone, meaning that the body's natural mechanism for controlling aldosterone is disrupted. Increased aldosterone levels can cause hypertension. Lorundrostat was designed to reduce aldosterone levels by inhibiting CYP11B2, the enzyme responsible for its production.

Results

The Launch-HTN trial was a global, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, which enrolled eligible adult participants who failed to achieve their blood pressure goal despite being on two to five antihypertensive medications. Launch-HTN reflects the real-world setting for clinicians by utilizing automated office blood pressure (AOBP) measurement and allowing participants to stay on their existing medications.

Lorundrostat 50 mg dosed once daily demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained reductions in systolic blood pressure, with a 16.9 mmHg reduction at Week 6 (-9.1 mmHg placebo adjusted) and a 19 mmHg reduction at Week 12 (-11.7mm placebo adjusted).",https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250524/Aldosterone-synthase-inhibitor-offers-hope-for-treatment-of-uncontrolled-hypertension.aspx,Business

MILAN, May 24 (Reuters) - Italian tyre maker Pirelli (PIRC.MI) , opens new tab is in a risky situation after its Chinese leading shareholder Sinochem rejected a proposal by the company to solve governance issues that could hinder its expansion in the United States, the group's CEO told daily Corriere della Sera on Saturday.

Pirelli and its second-largest shareholder, Italy's Camfin, have said Sinochem's shareholding was posing risks to the tyre maker's ambitions to expand in the U.S., where some lawmakers are opposed to approving projects backed by Chinese companies.

Sign up here.

The company had put forward a proposal to solve these governance issues, without releasing details on it, but earlier this month Pirelli's Chinese shareholder firmly rejected it.

""The goal is to find solutions that can guarantee Pirelli to operate in all markets of the world, particularly the U.S., without constraints and restrictions, thinking only of the company's industrial development,"" Pirelli CEO Andrea Casaluci said in an interview published on Saturday.

Pirelli makes over 20% of its revenue in North America and the percentage is 40% for sales of high-value products.

""Without a solution, the development of Pirelli's relevant technologies would be compromised and consequently future growth would also be at great risk, in all markets and especially in Italy,"" Casaluci said, adding that the group plans to expand its research and development activities in its home country.

Casaluci also said that Sinochem has presented its own proposal on the governance to the Italian government - which has so-called golden powers to block or limit foreign influence on domestic groups considered strategic - without consulting with the group.

Contacted by Reuters Pirelli and Sinochem were not immediately available to comment the interview.

Trumps wants to create manufacturing jobs. His tech allies invest in robots to do the work.,"""There's a fundamental conflict between these goals,"" one expert says.

Trumps wants to create manufacturing jobs. His tech allies invest in robots to do the work.

President Donald Trump has disrupted global trade and roiled markets in an effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Some of his top tech allies, however, have backed ventures that replace human workers with robots.

Elon Musk, a top donor and adviser to Trump, has touted humanoid robots as a future growth area for electric-carmaker Tesla. ""You can produce any product,” Musk said of the robots’ potential capacity during a February interview with Dubai's World Governments Summit.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who Trump last month called “terrific,” has invested in several advanced robotics firms.

Bezos last year poured funds into Figure, a humanoid robot company that says its initial rollout will focus on manufacturers and warehouses, among other business applications. “We believe humanoids will revolutionize a variety of industries,” the company says on its website.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman – both of whom joined Trump on his recent trip to the Middle East – helmed their respective companies as each invested in Figure. OpenAI ended its partnership with Figure last year.

“Trump is talking about bringing back the jobs, and he’s not understanding the tension between that goal and automation, which the tech bros have enthusiasm for,” Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University and a former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor, told ABC News. “There’s a fundamental conflict between those goals.”

Musk did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment made through Musk-owned firm SpaceX. Neither Bezos, Huang nor Altman responded to ABC News’ request.

Speaking at a conference in April, Huang said the onset of artificial intelligence would fuel ""new types of factories,"" which in turn would create jobs in construction and steelmaking, as well as in trades such as plumbing and electricity.

Even more, Huang said, AI is set to trigger a surge in productivity at companies that adopt the new technology, allowing them to add employees as the firms increase output and revenue.

""New jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, every job will be changed,"" Huang said. ""Remember, it's not AI that's going to take your job. It's not AI that's going to destroy your company. It's the company and the person who uses AI that's going to take your job. And so that's something to internalize.""

Even after a rollback of some levies, consumers face the highest overall average effective tariff rate since 1934, the Yale Budget Lab found earlier this month.

A key reason for the tariffs, White House officials say: Reshoring factories and rejuvenating employment in the manufacturing industry.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this month in an interview with Fox News that Trump's vision for ushering in a ""golden age"" for America involved enticing manufacturers to open factories and build in the United States.

""We're going to have huge jobs in manufacturing. You've heard the president talk about trillions and trillions of factories being built in America,"" he said in the interview on May 11.

In response to ABC News' request for comment, White House Spokesperson Kush Desai said ""the importance of President Trump’s push to reinvigorate American industry goes beyond creating good-paying jobs for everyday Americans.""

""Supply chain shocks of critical pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and semiconductors during the COVID era prove that America cannot rely on foreign imports. The Trump administration remains committed to reshoring manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security with a multifaceted approach of tariffs, tax cuts, rapid deregulation, and domestic energy production,"" Desai added.

The share of U.S. workers in manufacturing has plummeted for decades. Roughly 8% of U.S. workers currently hold positions in manufacturing, which marks a steep decline from about a quarter of all employees as recently as 1970.

Researchers attribute such decline to overlapping trends, including the offshoring of manufacturing to low-wage markets overseas and the adoption of labor-saving technology throughout the sector.

Long before current advances, automation significantly increased productivity in U.S. factories, meaning the same number of workers could produce many more goods, researchers at Ball State University found in 2015. As a result, they said, manufacturing employment stagnated for decades even as output climbed.

“Automation is something we’ve seen for a long time,” Philipp Kircher, a professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University, told ABC News.

Some of Trump’s tech allies have backed firms that seek to further automate manufacturing, touting a new wave of artificial-intelligence equipped robots as a replacement for some workers and salve for labor shortages.

Robotics outfit Vicarious boasts $250 million in investments from a set of backers that includes Bezos, Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg – all of whom flanked Trump during his inauguration.

On a webpage displaying photos of robots for use in warehouse settings, Vicarious tells potential clients that the products can “reduce both your costs and person-hour needs.”

In 2022, Vicarious was acquired by Alphabet-backed robotics software firm Intrinsic. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also sat alongside tech leaders at Trump’s inauguration.

Alphabet did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. Meta declined to comment.

Yong Suk Lee, a professor of economics and technology at the University of Notre Dame, described the views on automation among Trump’s tech allies and some of his trade advisers as “opposed.”

The tech position, Lee said, would likely win out, even if some firms do open plants in the U.S.

“If you want to reshore, are you going to pay the same wages as Vietnam? Probably not,” Lee said. “Companies are faced with higher labor costs. In that case, they’ll probably automate.”

Discordant views among some tech leaders and White House officials surfaced in April, when Musk sharply criticized tariff-advocate Peter Navarro, Trump’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing. Navarro, Musk said, is “truly a moron.”

In an interview with CNBC, Navarro responded, saying Musk ""isn't a car manufacturer — he's a car assembler.”

To be sure, analysts said, automation in manufacturing would likely continue regardless of support from Trump’s tech allies, since producers are locked in a competition to lower costs and increase output. The precise outlook for manufacturing employment is unclear, they added, since additional technology may add jobs for those maintaining and optimizing the machinery.

“Whether it’s the companies that currently support the U.S. president or not, somebody would be doing this innovation, maybe slightly slower,” Kircher said.

Even at current employment levels, a labor shortage bedevils U.S. manufacturers. Roughly one of every five U.S. factories that failed to produce at full capacity cited a shortage of workers, Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, found in a January study analyzing government data.

Agility Robots, an Amazon-backed firm building humanoid robots, identifies the current push for rejuvenated U.S. manufacturing as an opportunity for greater adoption of technology.

“Manufacturing companies are seeing a massive reshoring movement spanning various industries,” Agility Robots says on its website. “Adding a humanoid robot to your manufacturing facility is a great way to stay on the leading edge of automation.”

In response to ABC News' request for comment, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to previous remarks about robotics made by a company executive.

""Our goal is to ensure these systems improve safety and productivity. Technology should be used to help us retain and grow our talent through skill development and reimagining how we make our workplace better, both in productivity and safety. If we do this well, we’re certain to always innovate for our customers,"" Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, said in a September blog post.

Amazon has ""created more U.S. jobs in the last decade than any other company,"" Amazon said this month.",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trumps-create-manufacturing-jobs-tech-allies-invest-robots/story?id=121869903,Business
An automation framework for clinical codelist development validated with UK data from patients with multiple long-term conditions - BMC Medical Research Methodology,"The DynAIRx (Dynamic Artificial Intelligence for Medicines Optimisation) project aims to develop new, easy to use tools that support GPs and pharmacists to find patients living with multimorbidity (two or more long-term health conditions) who might be offered a better combination of medicines [46, 47]. DynAIRx uses structured EHR data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRDFootnote 5 [48,49,50,51]).

The National Health Service (NHS) introduced Structured Medication Reviews (SMRs), undertaken by GPs and pharmacists, with an aim to reduce the number of people taking potentially harmful drug combinations. However, there is no easy way of predicting who is most likely to benefit from a medication review. The DynAIRx project is developing tools to combine information from EHRs, clinical guidelines and risk-prediction models to ensure that clinicians and patients have the necessary information to prioritise and support SMRs.

DynAIRx focuses on multimorbidity [41] and polypharmacy [52, 53] within three key groups: (a) Older people with frailty, (b) People with co-existing mental and physical health problems, and (c) Other people with complex multimorbidity (\(\ge 4\) long-term conditions). ‘Multimorbidity’ [54,55,56,57,58,59] is a priority for global health research’, and defined by the NIHR as the co-existence of two or more long-term conditions, each one of which is either (a) A physical non-communicable disease of long duration, such as a cardiovascular disease or cancer. (b) A mental health condition of long duration, such as a mood disorder or dementia. (c) An infectious disease of long duration, such as HIV or hepatitis C.

In the following subsections we detail the application of the GCAF for DynAIRx.

Baseline codelists

In this design we used two baseline codelists from previous projects: the eFI2 (expansion of the electronic frailty index (eFI) [44]), and the “SERENDIP codelist” from a project on relational pattern mining for multi-morbidity [45]. The eFI is a frailty indicator derived from routinely available primary care electronic health record data and designed to support the identification of elderly people living with frailty. “SERENDIP” is a modified subset of CALIBER. We also made use of the NHS Digital SNOMED CT BrowserFootnote 6 for manually creating some of the conditions.

Simple conditions for GCAF within DynAIRx

To begin, we start by preprocessing the baseline codelists (discussed in Baseline codelists section). In this step we convert all the codelists into SNOMED.

After mapping to SNOMED, we derive the specific condition names like Epilepsy, Abdominal Hernia, Anxiety, Heart failure etc. This list of conditions was passed to “Clinician’s Intervention” to add comments regarding to keep all SNOMEDs, or split into sub categories or group with any other categories. Clinician’s of DynAIRx indicated one of “keep”, “group”, or “split”. Those marked “keep” were deemed to be “Simple Conditions” which do not require further aggregation or dis-aggregation. GCAF generates automatic codelists for such conditions, and then automatically validate them through CALIBER codelists (see Fig. 1). After this automatic validation, there are a small number of SNOMED codes requiring clinical validation, drastically reducing the clincal effort required.

Using this approach, we generated 112 conditions which each consist of between 2 and 207 SNOMED codes (see Fig. 2 for details including the name of conditions and their corresponding number of SNOMED codes). We observed that we have 15 conditions which each consist of 80 to 207 number of codes, 40 codelists which consist of 30 to 80 codes, 20 codelists with \(\sim 20\) codes, 25 codelists with \(\sim 10\) codes, and 35 codelists consisting of 2 to 10 codes.

Complex conditions for GCAF within DynAIRx

This subsection covers the conditions where clinicians recommended we group or split concepts, and with detailed instructions. Some examples of complex conditions are shown in Fig. 3. GCAF generates draft codelists for each of them using automation and then we manually merge or divide them following clinical recommendation. After this GCAF, shrinks and automatically validates codes using CALIBER (our trusted source) where possible and the remainder are validated by the clinical team. These codes get validated in short meetings, and the final codelists for DynAIRx are then agreed. Some examples of the journey when preparing difficult conditions are discussed below.

Fig. 3 Complex condition analysis after following clinical recommendations Full size image

Alcohol

Upon analysis of ‘Alcohol’ related conditions, we found the initial concepts: Alcohol Problem, Alcoholic Liver Disease, Alcohol-related Brain Injury, Autoimmune liver Disease, Chronic Liver disease And Viral hepatitis, Oesophageal varices, Alcohol, Liver problems, and Fatty Liver. We prepared draft codelists for these conditions using the GCAF modules and passed only the condition names to clinicians to review. Some example comments included: “eFI list includes codes for alcoholic liver disease. separate and have 1) alcohol problems and 2) alcoholic liver disease and 3) alcohol brain injury. The current eFI list is missing some of the alcohol brain injury codes”, and “would prefer to break this down by cause (alcohol being one, viral being another)’’. Using these guidelines we created final codelists of “Alcohol Problems”, “Alcohol-related Brain Injury”, “Alcohol Problems Others”, “Alcoholic Liver Disease”, “Autoimmune liver Disease”, “Fatty Liver”, “Liver Disease - Other”, “Liver Disease - Viral”. These were shrunk with the remainder undergoing clinical review Fig. 3a.

Cancer

For cancer, we initially generated codelists for “Cancer Haematological” and “Cancer Solid organ” from SERENDIP and a generic “Cancer” list from eFI2. After removing duplicates, this was shrunk and taken for clinical review. In this case we only removed a few rows of cancer using automation and the final number of codes for these conditions are shown in Fig. 3c.

Pulmonary Conditions

During analysis of pulmonary conditions, we initially drafted the following list of conditions: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Respiratory disease, COPD, Asthma, Primary Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Recurrent pulmonary embolus, and Secondary Pulmonary Hypertension. Clinical feedback on this intial list led to the following comments: “in eFI, can check and compare the codelists? asthma and COPD and pulmonary fibrosis are distinct codelists, is this covering others?”, “compare codelists”, “need to compare codelists for consistency”, “need to compare codelists for consistency”, and “Keep this - not currently covered by eFI list”. Following these comments, the final list of conditions that were shrunk and sent for clinical review were “Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)”, “Pulmonary embolism”, “Other Respiratory Disease”, “Respiratory failure”, “Sleep apnoea”, “Primary Pulmonary hypertension”, “Rheumatic heart disease”, “Asthma”, “Bronchiectasis”, “Cystic fibrosis”, “Pulmonary Fibrosis”, “Sarcoidosis”, “Occupational lung diseases”, “Pulmonary hypertension”, and “Interstitial lung disease”. The size of these conditions is shown in Fig. 3b.

Mental Health

We invested a significant amount of time in properly capturing mental health conditions. Our initial draft list of conditions included Learning Disability, Cognitive impairment, Dementia, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, depression, and different General mental health disorders. We got lots of feedback including: “Keep this - not currently covered by eFI list, might be some overlap with codes within cognitive impairment list - compare”, “include”, “compare to eFI cognitive impairment, dementia and memory problems list. happy to split into those 3 categories as per eFI” etc. After some clarification we were left with the following conditions “Anorexia/bulimia”, “Anxiety”, “Bipolar”,“Dementia”,“Personality Disorder”,“Schizoaffective”, and “Depression”. The number of codes for each mental health condition is shown in Fig. 3d.

Some of the other complex conditions requiring significant effort included tremor, fracture, headache, anaemia, stroke, bleed, angina, and ischaemic heart disease. Full details can be found by exploring our publicly available codelist repository (attached with proposed work), in particular the Github issues.

Shrinking of codelists for reduced validation requirement

All the complex and simple conditions went through the shrinking procedure prior to clinical review. In this phase we match the condition names with those of CALIBER to remove those SNOMED codes which were previously validated by CALIBER. For example: Bladder Dysfunction to the CALIBER lists kuan neuro bladder and kuan pri bladder, OCD to kuan ocd, Sickle cell anaemia to kuan sickle cell and kuan sickle trait, Gastritis and Duodenitis to kuan gastritis duodenitis etc. We then remove overlapping codes of all codelists, and sent the remaining codes (that are not present in CALIBER) for clinical review. An evaluation of the amount of workload this saved our clinical team is given in Results on shrinking of lists section.

Clinical validation strategy used with DynAIRx

After we automatically verify most of the SNOMED codes using CALIBER, we put the remaining “shrunken codelists” to a clinical review. Within DynAIRx we followed a strict strategy for reviews.

Strategy for clinical review

Codelists which fit at least one of the criteria below need to be reviewed by at least two clinicians:

Are a subset of a previously verified codelist but have not been clinically reviewed in any other context

Are a combination of previously clinically verified codelists but have not been clinically reviewed in any other context

Are for a condition without any existing published codelist (that has undergone clinical review)

Involve test codes (e.g. diagnosis as a result of a biomarker; in the case that none of the above criteria are fulfilled only the test codes need to be reviewed)

Codelists will not need to be manually reviewed if none of these criteria are met, meaning that codelists which have been previously published and require no modification when following our clinical comments may be used in DynAIRx without further review. In this case, the source of the codelist will be clearly logged.

Review process

All decisions will be clearly logged in the corresponding code files used to generate the final codelists (primarily notebook files, stored in GitHub, codes provided with paper).

Ambiguous/boundary codes

Some codes might be mildly or highly suggestive of a condition but not exclusive to it. Some researchers may favour including this code (prioritising sensitivity of codelists) whilst others may choose to exclude it (prioritising specificity), hence the terminology of ‘boundary’ codes. In cases where clinical input suggests a code may be considered a boundary case, this will be clearly logged (through a column ‘Boundary_case’ in the codelist CSV files which contains a value of 1 if a boundary code). Boundary codes must be reviewed by 2 clinicians, and each must give a preference for inclusion or exclusion (it is unlikely that this will be done in a blind or anonymous manner, since codelist review is likely to occur within a clincial panel). In the case where two clinicians disagree, a third will be used for a casting vote. Boundary codes which are chosen to be excluded will be noted in the corresponding code file used to generate the codelist.

Prevalence checking

Following completion of the codelists, the prevalence of conditions within the DynAIRx populations will be calculated and compared to published estimates of similar populations (where available). Should the estimates obtained using DynAIRx codelists be significantly different to those published estimates, codelists will be (re)reviewed. It is expected that DynAIRx prevalence estimates will be higher than those in the general population due to the multimorbid nature of the cohorts.

Patients and Public Involvement and Engagements (PPIE) Workshops

DynAIRx also conducted three workshops on Patients and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE). First in-person workshop (Feb 2024) was focused on aim of DynAIRx optimizing Structured Medical Reviews (SMR) using AI, involving six Work Packages (WP), focused on SMRs, AI Prediction, Causal Inference, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Visualization, and focusing on PPIE feedback. The second meeting (online in April 2024) was about listening of two PPIE members, clarifying their doubts, and noting things they want us to incorporate in our communication groups. The third workshop (in-person, June 2024) was held in the Civic Health Innovation Labs (CHIL), with the University of Liverpool about presenting AI work of clustering of patients trajectories for optimizing medications and generation of codelists along with proposed framework. As outcomes of these workshops mainly cover the priority of conditions, side effects, the burden of long-term prescriptions on patients, and feedback from public advisors using AI for medication optimizations, more details of them are out of the scope of this paper.",https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-025-02541-1,Business
Do your research and get the neighbours onboard: how to get solar panels on your apartment building in Australia,"Australia has the highest uptake of rooftop solar in the world – with more than 4m solar installations across the country.

In 2022 more than 30% of Australian households were generating solar energy on their rooftops – but in many cases people living in apartments have been left behind.

Despite accounting for 16% of Australia’s dwellings, only about 3% of apartments have solar installed.

To give apartment dwellers the same opportunity to access clean and affordable solar energy, state governments are offering generous rebates to help them join the clean energy transition, including this program, open to apartment owners in NSW.

But there are a few steps you’ll need to consider before signing up.

Do your research

Rob McKay lives in a block of nine double-brick apartments in the Sydney suburb of Cremorne with a mix of renters and owner occupiers.

“We first started looking at solar for the building before Covid. We’re fortunate in that our local council, North Sydney, is very supportive of sustainability options,” he says, noting in particular council rebates for solar panels and batteries.

“We realised we were eligible for a battery rebate from the state government [as well as] the North Sydney council rebates.”

After researching the options he found out about technology that enables the allocation of power between multiple units behind the meter. The next step was to use a solar comparison website to assess the building’s solar and battery needs, as well as EV infrastructure requirements in the building’s basement.

“Armed with that information, we ran a tender for solar and battery suppliers, chose a preferred supplier and installed a system that went live in December” he says.

Build up some capital

McKay says that, in retrospect, the delays from lockdowns were a blessing as they allowed the apartment block time to build up its capital works fund (thereby avoiding the need for a special levy) and to understand the options better. “Since flicking the switch, we’ve generated 82% of our overall power consumption, although we share that in both directions with the grid.

“As a result, we’ve had material decreases in our individual power bills and happy residents, whether owner occupiers or tenants.”

Get the neighbours onboard

Once you’ve figured out which rebates you are eligible for, you’ll still need to navigate a careful path between your owners’ corporation, fellow apartment owners or occupiers and strata managers.

Be prepared to come up against some resistance, as some owners may not be keen to front up the extra costs involved, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. But highlighting the longterm economic savings of the investment is a good strategy.

Jeff Sykes from Solar Choice says the benefits can be enormous for apartment dwellers as they are often the people most in need of assistance with growing energy costs.

“Shared solar projects targeting the whole building also benefit renters who traditionally have been left out of solar projects,” he says.

“The feedback once solar is installed is almost always overwhelmingly positive and these projects will improve the property values of all owners and deliver benefits to residents for 25 years.”

Install a smart meter

McKay says the best way to bring neighbours along for the journey is to install a smart meter so that everyone can see how the power is being distributed. This also helps to keep up regular communication throughout the installation process.

“It has made residents more aware of their power consumption, opening up more electricity retailer options for them,” he says.

Ultimately, if you can help get everyone’s power bill down while reducing your carbon footprint, that’s a win for everyone.

Summary measures in non-inferiority clinical trials with a time-to-event outcome: an empirical comparison of power - BMC Medical Research Methodology,"We found the DRMST estimated using a flexible parametric survival model under proportional hazards to be the most powerful summary measure for non-inferiority clinical trials with a time-to-event outcome. This remained consistent whether \(\tau\) was defined clinically or based on the maximum follow-up time. Non-parametric estimation of the DRMST at \(\tau _{max}\) was equivalent to flexible parametric estimation of DRMST in all analyses. Using \(\tau _{clin}\) for the KM estimation of the DRMST reduced empirical power in most analyses, indicating that, for non-parametric estimation, using the longest available follow-up time is beneficial. Moreover, we found the estimation of DS under proportional hazards to outperform its non-parametrically estimated counterpart in all scenarios. The former performed slightly worse than the DRMST overall. Additionally, the HR never outperformed the DS under proportional hazards, although it frequently outperformed the non-parametrically estimated DS. Thereby, the DS was observed to benefit strongly from the proportional hazards framework. The HR was outperformed by the DRMST in all scenarios, with exception of the high event risk group, where the empirical power was identical.

Our estimates of empirical power when the margin was converted using the exponential distribution were less conclusive about the difference in performance between DS and DRMST, but showed that both outperformed the HR regardless of the estimation method. We hypothesise that the differences in empirical power between the two conversion methods are attributable to the trials for which the expected event rate deviated from the observed event rate. For these trials, the exponential distributions were an inaccurate approximation of the observed data in the control arm (see Appendix K). This leads to an incompatible conversion of the non-inferiority margin. The variability observed when using the exponential distribution as compared to the flexible parametric model for the margin conversion highlights the importance of correct margin matching between summary measures. Theoretically, using the expected event rate rather than the observed is preferable, but our simulations (yet to be published) show that incorrect specification of the expected survival curve leads to large reductions in power or inflation of type I error rate. Therefore, we gave preference to estimation of the survival curve using the observed data. While it has been shown that converting the margin based on observed data can inflate error rates with binary data [24], after exploratory simulations, we expect this choice to have little effect on the type I error rate in these settings.

The definition of the non-inferiority margin is an important aspect in both the comparison between summary measures and the design of non-inferiority trials [25]. Because the non-inferiority margin is the minimum non-acceptable boundary of the (1-\(\alpha\))\(\cdot 100\)%-confidence interval, where \(\alpha\) is the significance level, the margin is inherently tied to the chosen summary measure, meaning that margins need to be correctly matched for a fair comparison. Incorrect conversion of a margin between measures could give a false benefit to one measure as a mere consequence of the margins being incomparable [26]. As such, accurate translation of one margin to another is of vital importance for a power comparison between summary measures. Tables 6 and 7 in Appendix suggest, though, that margins are on average different depending on if the original scale was the HR or DS. For example, the average non-inferiority margin when the original scale was HR (Table 6 in Appendix) is approximately 1.5, with an average DS of around five percentage points. However, when the original scale was DS (Table 7 in Appendix), we find an average margin of seven percentage points, with an average HR of 2.

The importance of properly defining the non-inferiority margin is further highlighted in guidelines published by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) [27, 28]. FDA’s 2016 guideline outlines key considerations in the design and analysis of non-inferiority trials. They stress that margin choices define the validity of the conclusions drawn from non-inferiority trials. They additionally emphasize that margins should be defined during the design phase based on prior knowledge. EMA’s 2004 guideline, focused specifically on the non-inferiority margin, similarly remarks how statistical reasoning and clinical judgement should be the basis for margin definition. Notably, neither guideline addresses how to appropriately choose a summary measure. The FDA discusses measures for both absolute and relative risk differences, but focuses mainly on the hazard ratio with respect to time-to-event data, while the EMA guideline does not discuss summary measures.

While for the purpose of this study, it was important to convert the margins correctly, in order to make the comparisons as fair as possible, in reality when designing non-inferiority trials, margins should be designed on the original scale following clinical guidance, such that it has a meaningful interpretation for the chosen summary measure. This advice is given despite elongation of follow-up increasing power in the non-parametric setting. Since power gain was marginal, while clinical interpretability is vital, the recommendation remains to define the non-inferiority margin as the most clinically meaningful in the first instance, and to only resort to considerations around power when more than one summary measure is considered clinically appropriate.

Of note, conversion of the margin is only necessary for (i) methodological comparisons of summary measures, as in this work, or (ii) situations where the summary measure was changed from the original plan after the design has been finalised. For the latter situation, we plan to publish guidelines on correctly matching the margins, where we plan to include a simulation comparison of various approaches.

Direct interpretation of the average p-values is complicated, because of a non-uniform and non-normal distribution of the observed p-values with a tendency towards zero with occasional outliers of high (\(>0.4\)) p-values. Therefore, descriptive statistics were reported alongside the average p-values (also see Appendix I). Regardless, a clear trend was observed in the primary analysis: p-values of the DRMST and DS were consistently lower than the corresponding p-values of the HR. This was not observed in the comparison of the DS and DRMST. Additionally, the lowest average p-value was in line with the highest empirical power, for all analyses performed under the margin conversion with a flexible parametric model. In case of equivalence between summary measures in terms of power, the DRMST was generally favourable in terms of p-values. This gives an extra advantage to the DRMST, even under equivalent power.

Outcomes of the subgroup analyses were consistent with the primary analysis, strengthening the conclusion of a power advantage for the DRMST. Analysis solely on trials for which no evidence of non-proportionality was found were completely in line with the full analysis. As expected, under stratification by original summary measure, power performance increased for the corresponding summary measure. This again highlights the importance of correct margin conversion. Note that while the margin for the DRMST was calculated through the HR, even when the original margin was defined for the DS, the DRMST performs equivalently to the DS while the HR considerably drops in power for the analysis of the DS subgroup. No such behaviour was observed for the HR subgroup, with outcomes equivalent to the primary analysis.

The most noticeable difference between subgroups was observed between event risks. In the case of a low event risk, the DRMST clearly outperformed the DS and HR, but performance was similar for all summary measures when the event risk was high. This outcome is in line with the fact that estimation of the HR is dependent on the number of events, meaning that when the event risk is high – and more events occur – the HR is more informative and can be estimated more precisely. Thereby, performance of the HR in terms of power increases.

The main challenge in the use of the DS and DRMST is the choice of \(\tau\) [26, 29]. Namely, \(\tau\) should be chosen such that the follow-up period is long enough to evaluate the outcome reliably, while at the same time optimised as to not have unnecessarily long follow-up times. The optimal method for determining the appropriate value of \(\tau\) remains unclear. In our study, little difference in performance between the two explored options of \(\tau\) were observed. Because the maximum \(\tau\) was defined differently from the clinical \(\tau\) only for trials with additional follow-up over the pre-specified moment of evaluation, it held that \(\tau _{max}

e \tau _{clin}\) for only 18 (\(27.7\%\)) trials. Therefore, \(\tau _{max}\) equalled \(\tau _{clin}\) for the majority of trials, leading to identical outcomes. This might have caused the marginal changes between different definitions of \(\tau\). Analysing both possibilities was done for exploration purposes, because equivalent margins between summary measures were not readily available. In line with previous recommendations [30], we recommend choosing \(\tau\) as a clinically meaningful moment of evaluation.

Furthermore, we acknowledge that true follow-up times may have exceeded those reported, since it is common for trials to omit full follow-up to avoid long tails. This has some implications for all three summary measures. If the reported follow-up time was arbitrary such that enough data was presented without showing long tails with few events, our definition of \(\tau\) (whether undefined at the moment of evaluation, or set as \(\tau _{max}\) otherwise) holds little clinical meaning. This raises the question of how to appropriately choose a \(\tau\) suitable for the situation at hand, as pointed out by Freidlin, Hu and Korn [26]. Omitting longer follow-up also affects estimates of the HR, because of possible deviations from proportional hazards and different behaviour of the event rate at different times after baseline.

In line with Weir and Trinquart [13], we found an empirical power advantage of the DRMST over the HR. As compared to their findings, we found a larger discrepancy between the HR and DRMST – i.e. more trials with a different conclusion between the HR and DRMST – possibly showing the additional benefit of estimation of DRMST under proportional hazards. However, difference between non-parametric and parametric estimation of DRMST only gave marginal differences, suggesting the stronger differences might just be due to chance. In their study, they found a different conclusion between the summary measures only for one trial. In this subset of the 35 trials, we found an additional two trials with opposing conclusions. Even with the non-inferiority margin as defined by Weir and Trinquart, who used the Weibull distribution for margin conversion, these discrepancies remain. Furthermore, our findings were in line with the simulation results of Quartagno et al. [10].

Our study has a number of limitations, the first one being the limited sample size of 65 trials. This was the number of trials we could realistically include. The limited sample size is especially apparent in the subgroup analyses, where subgroups became as small as 24 trials. The difference in empirical power between HR and DRMST, while confirming the results of previous simulation studies, are not statistically significantly different from 0. However, the pattern of a power benefit when using DRMST across analyses confirms the plausibility that there is such an effect or even larger. With respect to the subgroup analysis for the trials without evidence of a violated proportional hazards assumption, it should be noted that trials were categorised solely on the Grambsch–Therneau test. As such, some trials portrayed clear evidence of non-proportionality (e.g. because of crossing Kaplan–Meier curves), but were not excluded in the subgroup analysis due to a non-significant Grambsch–Therneau test. This is further highlighted by the fact that we found additional trials to violate the proportional hazards assumption in the 35 previously reconstructed trials by Weir and Trinquart [13], and vice versa. Thus, one may wonder if, since the absence of evidence for non-proportionality is not evidence of proportionality, clinical considerations should be taken into account when determining adherence to the proportional hazards assumption.

Moreover, reconstructed data were used rather than the original; as a results, our data may have deferred from the actual underlying trial data. In doing so, all information on patient characteristics were lost, excluding the possibility of adjusted estimations. To ensure comparability, the reconstructed summary measure was compared with the original summary measure for all trials such that the reconstruction was within an acceptable range. If the original summary measure could not be reconstructed within a margin of 0.05 for the HR and DS, and 0.1 for the DRMST, the trial was excluded.

Lastly, as previously acknowledged, another limitation is the margin conversion. Since performing the margin conversion under an incorrect distribution may lead to large biases, ensuring the conversion was done correctly was a crucial aspect of this study. To ensure correct specification of the survival curve, we used observed data, thereby using the observed data twice - both in the margin conversion and later in the analyses. However, employing this approach avoids misspecification of the distribution, strengthening comparability between summary measures.

In the design of non-inferiority trials, margins should be defined directly for the chosen summary measure, without intermediate conversion between measures such that the margin is clinically meaningful. To this end, further exploration should be done on how to choose a \(\tau\) that is both clinically relevant and optimises the length of follow-up. Additionally, further investigation into robustness against violation of the proportional hazards assumption is needed.",https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-025-02576-4,Business
Holidaymakers told to beware buying Avios points on Facebook after scams,"Holidaymakers hoping to use frequent flyer points to reduce the cost of their holiday have been warned to beware of fraudsters claiming to sell them on third-party websites.

In a case that highlights the dangers of buying points through unofficial channels, a young couple were left hundreds of pounds out of pocket after they were defrauded by a scammer who claimed to be selling them British Airways loyalty points.

Nigel Turner*, a small business owner, believed he was buying Avios points from someone on a Facebook group when he was planning a trip to Corfu for the end of this month.

Turner paid £200 for 60,000 Avios points that he thought would contribute towards two business class flights for the 10-day break. Without the points, the flights cost £1,300.

But after the points had been transferred and he booked the tickets, it emerged that they did not belong to the seller. Turner was told by BA that the points had been “fraudulently obtained”.

He was left with a non-refundable hotel booking and airport transfers worth £700.

“Both of us are self-employed so this has hit us hard, financially and emotionally,” he said. “It’s heartbreaking to tell someone you love that the holiday you both looked forward to for months is gone.”

He added: “We would have never flown business class, to be honest, without seeing this. It was just a cool thing which we thought we could do and it would cost the same amount as a normal flight.”

Turner paid of the points using a bank transfer, and they were transferred to his Avios account.

But then BA contacted him and said the points had been fraudulently obtained and removed them from him. The airline said it knew Turner had nothing to do with the fraud, and refunded the additional legitimate Avios he used towards the flight.

“Scams like this can still happen even when you think you’ve protected yourself. I had the points in my account before paying – and I still got scammed,” he said. “If it’s happening in one Facebook group with 75,000 members, you can bet it’s happening in others too.”

Up to 60,000 Avios points can be transferred legitimately between people on the airline’s website for an admin fee of £50.

BA said in a statement that the sale of the points had violated its terms and conditions as selling or buying “via outside sources” was forbidden.

It added that the stolen Avios points had been restored to the person who they belonged to. Turner said the person who sold him the fraudulent points had deleted his Facebook account.

New rules requiring banks and other payment companies to reimburse fraud victims who have been tricked into sending money to scammers took effect last October. Turner has now been refunded the £200 he paid.

Summary

Companies Trump's approval clears last big hurdle for the deal

US Steel shares surge 21% on Trump comments

Trump to hold a rally at US Steel in Pittsburgh next Friday

Shares of U.S. Steel soared 21% as investors interpreted Trump's post on Truth Social to mean Nippon Steel had received his approval for its long-planned takeover, the last major hurdle for the deal.

Sign up here.

""This will be a planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel, which will create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 Billion Dollars to the U.S. Economy,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

This week, Reuters reported that Nippon Steel has said if the merger is approved, it would invest $14 billion into U.S. Steel's operations, including up to $4 billion in a new steel mill.

Trump added that the bulk of that investment would occur in the next 14 months and said he would hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh next Friday.

U.S. Steel praised Trump's leadership.

""U.S. Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies, and thousands of jobs,"" the company said in a statement.

Nippon Steel also applauded Trump's decision. ""The partnership is a game changer - for U.S. Steel and all of its stakeholders, including the American steel industry, and the broader American manufacturing base,"" the Japanese company said in a statement on Saturday.

A Nippon Steel spokesperson in Tokyo declined to comment on the $14 billion investment and the 14-month timeline that Trump cited.

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the announcement. It is unclear whether Trump's term ""partnership"" refers to the full acquisition Nippon Steel has been pursuing.

For Japan's top steelmaker, the deal is core to its global expansion strategy, lifting production to 86 million metric tons from 63 million tons now - especially at a time when domestic demand is declining.

The merger would create the world's third-largest steel producer by volume, following China's Baowu Steel Group and Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal (MT.LU) , opens new tab , according to World Steel Association data.

U.S. Steel kept rising after hours, hitting $54, just shy of the $55 per share that Nippon Steel offered in late 2023. While no details were released, investors expressed confidence that terms will be similar to those agreed in 2023. Investors said that eventually U.S. Steel will no longer be publicly traded and they will receive a cash payout for their shares.

The deal has been one of the most highly anticipated on Wall Street after it morphed into the political arena with fears that foreign ownership would mean job losses in Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel is headquartered. It factored into last year's election, in which Trump regained the White House.

Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick, who also called the deal a ""partnership,"" said on Friday it was a ""huge victory for America and the U.S. Steel Corporation,"" which will protect more than 11,000 Pennsylvania jobs and support the creation of at least 14,000 more.

The last pieces of the deal came together surprisingly fast. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews deals for national security risks, told the White House this week that the security risks can be addressed, Reuters reported, moving the final decision to Trump's desk.

Following an earlier CFIUS-led review, then-President Joe Biden blocked the deal in January on national security grounds. The companies sued, arguing they did not receive a fair review process. The Biden White House rejected that view.

The companies argued Biden opposed the deal when he was running for reelection to win support from the United Steelworkers union in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. The Biden administration had defended the review as essential to protecting security, infrastructure and supply chains.

Trump also initially opposed the deal, arguing the company must be owned and operated in the U.S.

The United Steelworkers were against the deal as recently as Thursday when they urged Trump to block the deal despite the $14 billion investment pledge from Trump.

For investors, including prominent hedge funds, the news spells relief after more than a year of waiting for a resolution. ""There were huge high-fives all around today,"" one recent investor said, adding, ""We understood Donald Trump's psyche and we played it to our advantage here.""

Investors said Trump appears to have won ground after the pledge for new investments was increased.

""This deal ensures that steelmaking will live on in Pittsburgh for generations,"" another investor said.

From matcha lattes to Dubai chocolate – how supermarkets fight to cope with TikTok trends,"TikTok’s algorithm is one of the great mysteries of the modern age. What it deems to be interesting is fed to millions of users, giving it huge cultural sway, from fashion to music and politics. It is also increasingly influencing what we eat.

Supermarkets were once the trendsetters, studying popular items on restaurant menus and recreating them on their shelves. Now the big shops are the ones being influenced, says Zoe Simons, a brand development chef at Waitrose.

“The power has flipped,” she says. “Before, we relied on what was popular at restaurants or we had to wait months for data to come through. Now, because of TikTok and Instagram, our accuracy has gotten so much better.”

It is not hard to spot this influence in action: matcha lattes, made from Japanese green tea, have exploded in popularity on social media, and now feature on menus at Pret a Manger, Starbucks and Gail’s. This week, Britain’s biggest bakery chain, Greggs, attributed better sales growth to a mac and cheese that “went viral on TikTok”, with a video of the snack played more than 3m times.

Perhaps most notably: the “Dubai chocolate” bar, invented by Sarah Hamouda, a British-Egyptian living in Dubai, became a huge viral hit. One video of a food influencer eating the bar, which contains a filling of pistachio cream and tahini with knafeh (a traditional Arab dessert), has more than 120m views on TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance.

Now supermarkets are using artificial intelligence tools that track online recipes, social media discussions and restaurant reviews to react faster to these trends. Where product development projects used to take months, products can hit the shelves in as little as a few weeks.

The Dubai chocolate bar, for example, has inspired a range of pistachio treats from big shops in the UK. Lidl launched its own version, as did Lindt, and when Waitrose launched it in March it imposed on customers a two-bar limit.

But in the fields of the global agricultural sector – far from screen-addicted British shoppers, UK supermarkets or even TikTok’s headquarters in Singapore – producers are struggling to cope with the sudden, huge spikes caused by rapid food trends.

The popularity of the Dubai chocolate bar has already contributed to a shortage in the green nut. In the past year, pistachio kernel prices have risen from €6.65 (£5.59) a pound to €8.96 a pound, an increase of nearly 35%, according to the data monitor platform Tridge. It is on track to hit €10.80 a pound by the end of the year, Tridge said.

That is despite the fact that production of the nut has expanded rapidly. The US is now the biggest producer of pistachios in the world. American pistachio farms, which are mostly in California, collectively account for 43% of global production, making an even larger contribution in its category than America’s market share in its traditional agricultural exports such as corn, cheese and beef.

It is a similar story in the matcha industry. A spike in demand for the green powder prompted tea companies Ippodo and Marukyu Koyamaen in Kyoto to impose purchase limits last year. That was again despite huge ramp-ups in production in an attempt to meet demand: Japan produced 4,176 tonnes of matcha in 2023, nearly three times the quantity in 2010.

The shortage has not been easy to navigate for Hanife Hursit, a 25-year-old who three weeks ago opened a matcha and coffee shop with her father, Ram, in King’s Cross, London.

“Right before my first stock, my suppliers said we might have to wait for a while,” she says. “The shortage is a big issue, it’s blown up everywhere.”

But the opening of Frothee, Hursit’s cafe, attracted a huge queue of customers, mainly young women, on the first day.

The young entrepreneur, who used to work as a social media manager and has a personal following of more than 19,000 accounts on TikTok, has built her menu around drinks and flavour combinations trending online. They include strawberry, brown sugar and jasmin-flavoured matcha lattes.

“I knew how much it had blown up online and I knew it was going to reach a peak where everyone loved matcha,” she says. Many of the drinks have been inspired by at-home recipes trending on TikTok, she adds. “Earl grey matcha is our bestseller by far,” she says. “Whatever I put on the menu was crafted by my For You page and also by what I love.”

The temptation to add pistachio flavours on her menu has been strong, but rapidly rising wholesale costs have been a barrier. “I said to our baker: ‘Should we try a pistachio product?’ But it’s just too expensive, even at wholesale prices.”

The environmental cost may also prove to be another barrier for sellers in the future, Mzingaye Ndubiwa, a market analyst at Tridge, adds.

“The pistachio nut is a water-intensive crop cultivated mainly in California or Iran, which are known for their drought-torn regions,” he says. “Ultimately leading to the overuse of groundwater, the increased demand from the international market puts immense stress on water systems that are already scarce.”

There are fears too that rapidly expanding the cultivation of a single crop, driven by social media trends, could contribute to deforestation for monoculture farming, which in turn harms wildlife. “Because of this, there is an increased reliance on herbicides and pesticides, which contaminate soil and water systems,” he said.

“Trends steered by social media can fuel environmental decline if it disappears as quickly as it appeared.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/24/from-matcha-lattes-to-dubai-chocolate-how-supermarkets-fight-to-cope-with-tiktok-trends,Business
Stewardship in AQTION: How the World’s Largest Investors Handle Their Assets,"AQTION, leveraging its proprietary database powered by SquareWell Partners, published its second review on how the world’s largest 65 investors (hereafter referred to as the “Top 65”) are evaluating governance and sustainability issues and stewarding their portfolios. Together these investors (including some of the largest Assets Managers, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and Pension Funds) have nearly USD 91 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM). See a summary post of the findings from last year’s study.

In this year’s analysis of the Top 65, the composition of the universe remains almost identical with the previous year, with only one change: Voya Investment Management (Asset Manager, US) replacing Baillie Gifford (Asset Manager, UK). To maintain comparability, the study retained the same factors used in the previous year’s assessment, while also incorporating new factors designed to capture investor sentiment on emerging topics of interest, such as artificial intelligence.

Notably, this year’s analysis looked athow these influential investors voted on high-profile situations. This includes, for example, the 2024 board contest at Walt Disney and the controversial approval of Elon Musk’s multi-billion dollar pay package at Tesla. These real-world examples offer valuable context to understand how the Top 65 investors are exercising their influence on critical corporate governance matters.

The full report is available here. Below, we highlight some of the key takeaways from AQTION’s review of the stewardship activities of the Top 65 investors, with selected points explored in greater depth.

i. Stewardship Teams

Implementation of structures necessary for stewardship activities – such as the introduction of a stewardship team, or publication of a voting policy – are mature in their development.

Regulatory turbulence, especially SEC’s revised guidance for a more stringent approach to monitoring investor activities that could influence corporate control, may lead investors to carefully evaluate their engagement strategies with portfolio companies and be less transparent in engagements, leaving companies to rely more heavily on their public positions and voting behavior to understand their position.

ii. Pass-Through Voting

As Pass-Through Voting proliferates among index investors, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, active managers remain reluctant to adopt, indicating that voting is more strongly regarded as necessary for active fund management.

iii. Voting Guidelines

Only 18 investors have published one or several regional policies, indicating that stewardship is generally configured to apply global principles. Notably, State Street Global Advisors consolidated several policies into one global position in 2024.

Investors’ voting guidelines published in 2025 have also generally become less prescriptive and more principles-based compared to previous iterations. Notably, several investors have scaled back their focus on Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) issues in response to recent political backlash, particularly in the U.S. However, no similar shift has been observed regarding climate-related expectations, which remain an important issue for investors.

iv. Proxy Advisors

Proxy Advisors continue to be influential on investor vote decision making, but are not commonly relied on heavily. ISS continues to be the clear leader in supplying research, however, Schroders switched to Glass Lewis as their primary proxy advisor in the year.

While many investors seek recommendations from Proxy Advisors, most of the Top 65 investors have developed their own internal voting guidelines. To this end, AQTION notes that only 9 of these investors exhibit a “High” reliance on their chosen Proxy Advisor’s recommendations, whereas 35 investors show a “Low” reliance (see Graph 1). As highlighted by ISS’s latest Best Practices Principle Statement, approximately 91% of the total voted shares processed by ISS on behalf of their clients are linked to clients’ custom voting policies. This means that rather than relying on ISS’s standard research recommendations, investors have ISS apply their own voting guidelines when determining how to vote at general meetings.

v. Stewardship Transparency – Votes and Rationales

Investor Voting Behavior and Rationale: 56 of the Top 65 investors disclose their voting records, with close to half providing vote rationales (see Graph 2). A few, such as CalPERS and Norges Bank Investment Management (“NBIM”), go further by pre-declaring their voting intentions, while others like Legal & General Investment Management (“LGIM”) and Neuberger Berman do so only for high-profile or contentious votes.

vi. Investor Communication on Key Topics

Despite ongoing pushback against elements of the ESG ecosystem in 2024—including the withdrawal of several prominent investors from Climate Action 100+ and the suspension of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in January 2025, investors continue to communicate their expectations on a broad spectrum of topics ranging from executive pay to biodiversity.

vi.a. One-Off Awards

Investors generally have reservations about awards granted outside of the standard pay package (“One-Off Awards”), considering these awards often reward executives for actions widely considered to be within the scope of their responsibilities. AQTION finds that 34 out of the Top 65 investors provide insight into this topic (see Graph 3). While 8 investors, such as J.P. Morgan Asset Management (“JPMAM”) and Aberdeen Investments are against one-off awards as a matter of principle, other investors (26 of the Top 65) may support special awards outside of Remuneration Policy where the company can demonstrate truly exceptional circumstances and/or significant additional value creation.

vi.b. Artificial Intelligence

As Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) rapidly transforms industries and business models, investor scrutiny on its ethical use, governance, and long-term impact has intensified. AQTION finds that 26 of the Top 65 investors have published dedicated position papers on AI, outlining their expectations for how companies should responsibly integrate AI into their operations. These papers emphasis the need for clear governance frameworks, transparency in AI development and deployment, and an understanding of the societal and ethical risks involved. Investors are urging companies to demonstrate accountability, ensure fairness, and safeguard against potential negative consequences as AI becomes a more integral part of business strategies.

vii. Shareholder Activism

Shareholder Activism: Activism is now a core component of voting guidelines, with 39 of the Top 65 investors incorporating criteria for evaluating activism situations. This marks a broader shift toward proactive stewardship, as traditional investors increasingly use public channels—such as press releases and media statements—to hold companies accountable. Notably, 29 investors have recently disclosed concerns about portfolio company performance or governance in case studies and stewardship reports. In 2024 and early 2025, Neuberger Berman exemplified this trend by publishing detailed voting rationales for high-profile activism cases, including Walt Disney (US), Keisei Electric Railway (JP), UGI Corporation (US), and Rio Tinto (UK), as well as for uncontested votes.

viii. Investors’ Voting Scorecard

AQTION’s analysis of the Top 65 investors voting behavior suggests that European asset managers appear more comfortable challenging management through their votes, while U.S. investors show a marked hesitance to do so (see Graph 4). This divergence is particularly evident in high-profile cases involving companies such as Boeing, Apple, ExxonMobil, and Walt Disney.

"Plastic Spoons, Umbrellas, Violins: A Guide to What Americans Buy From China","Photo Illustration by Zak Bickel/The New York Times; Photographs via Getty; Unsplash

Plastic Spoons, Umbrellas, Violins: A Guide to What Americans Buy From China The things the U.S. imports a lot, the things it doesn’t and everything in between.

Tariffs are up. Tariffs are down. Shipping is frozen. Shipping is back on.

In the past several weeks, Chinese imports to the U.S. have been on a seesaw, leaving Americans uncertain how tariffs will affect their lives.

It’s impossible to say what tariffs will do to the price or availability of any particular item, although even the Trump administration’s current level of 30 percent tariffs — on top of previous levies — will certainly make many things more expensive.

But thanks to detailed trade data, we know what Americans buy from China, and how much of it, and thus what might be most sensitive to future swings in trade status.

Here are several ways of understanding what’s on those container ships, based on 2024 data from the U.S. International Trade Commission.

First, the products where the greatest share of our imports are Chinese imports:

Goods Americans import almost exclusively from China ITEM Pct. from

Source: U.S. International Trade Commission

This list is the simplest way to think about which Chinese goods the U.S. relies on most. But percentages aren’t everything. Americans buy so much from China that even goods with smaller imported shares from there could still be significantly affected by tariffs.

This list skews slightly toward more expensive goods that the average American purchases infrequently, particularly electronics. But the International Trade Commission also tracks how many of each good the U.S. imports.

In that list, you can see Americans’ well-documented reliance on China for plastic products.

Many of America’s major imports from China are consumer goods: things you buy for yourself, like clothes, housewares or entertainment. Drill down into those categories and specific products stand out.

For example, American wardrobes are somewhat dependent on China: about a fifth of U.S. clothing imports. But a majority of neckties and gloves and pantyhose are imported from China.

The U.S. is more reliant on China for things made with polyester and nylon (like pantyhose) than for those made with cotton.

Athletes, especially racket-sport players, are also dependent on China:

There are also consumer-goods categories whose “Made in China” status may not be as well known. For example, the U.S. gets a lot of its imported string instruments — such as violins and cellos — from China.

The Japanese company Yamaha manufactures some of its instruments in China, including trumpets and drums.

The U.S. also relies on China for many of its vitamins …

Then there are the goods that the U.S. imports primarily to put inside other things, like car parts.

The U.S. relies heavily on Chinese imports to build electric vehicles in particular: Some 70 percent of its imported lithium-ion batteries are from China.

Even batteries made in the U.S. often rely on raw materials from China, particularly graphite. (China tightened its export controls on graphite at the end of last year, so this year’s numbers could end up looking very different.)

Mr. Trump’s newest tariffs are not the only levies imposed on Chinese goods, and there’s a complicated interplay of which tariffs apply to which products. Some goods that a lot of Americans buy received exemptions from the latest tariffs (though perhaps not future ones), including one item the U.S. imports almost exclusively from China: children’s books.

That’s a window into what Americans buy from China. But for some imports, the U.S. doesn’t rely on China. It’s a list that includes large vehicles, precious metals and tomatoes, all of which America imports largely from other countries.

Includes categories where less than 0.5 percent of goods are from China.

It’s also worth noting what America exports to China. Though the U.S. sends fewer goods to China than it receives, these could still be affected in a trade war. (China has been instituting its own exemptions, which are broader than those of the U.S.)

ESMO releases updated scale to measure clinical benefit of cancer treatments,"The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) is pleased to announce the publication of the latest version of the scale that measures the clinical benefit of cancer treatments, the ESMO-MCBS (ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale).

ESMO-MCBS v2.0 is more than just a technical revision of the scale. ESMO-MCBS v2.0 brings significant enhancements in the evaluation of cancer therapies, because it is more robust, it is aligned with the changing treatment landscape, and adds to the accuracy, fairness, and utility of treatment assessments."" Sjoukje Oosting, Chair of the ESMO-MCBS Working Group

ESMO-MCBS v2.0 is the outcome of a comprehensive revision process consolidating numerous feedback from different stakeholders, including patients. This version incorporates 13 critical amendments, including a new evaluation form for single-arm de-escalation studies in the adjuvant setting. Overall, the changes impact the scores of 13.6% of evaluated studies and add toxicity annotations to 45.5% of the studies in the curative setting.

Toxicity annotations have been added for curative treatments after consultation with patient representatives. ""When cure is a possibility, thresholds for toxicity trade-off acceptance can vary between patients,"" observes Oosting. By adding a toxicity annotation, clearly signposted for the end-user, the scale provides adequate forewarning of the likelihood of severe toxicities without penalising the grading of the medicine. ""This refinement ensures that the scale is mindful of patient preferences, ensuring a balanced understanding of treatment benefits and risks,"" Oosting notes.

Reflecting the overall aim for increased rigour, the ESMO-MCBS v2.0 version continues to clearly indicate cases where the underlying data-such as progression-free survival and overall survival results – are still immature or pending, offering clarity and transparency in the interpretation of data at a time when fast approval of drugs requires the scoring to happen as quickly as possible, yet with data that is non final.

ESMO-MCBS v2.0 scoring criteria are generally more stringent and methodologically refined, particularly in the curative setting, enhancing the tool's robustness and reliability.

This version ensures that the scale is aligned with current clinical practice, offers a more solid and transparent framework to evaluate the magnitude of clinical benefit, and sets the stage for further ongoing improvements.

""The release of ESMO-MCBS v2.0 marks a major step forward in ESMO's mission to promote value-based cancer care, and clearly reflects ESMO's ongoing commitment to ensuring that the scale remains a robust, transparent, and clinically meaningful tool for evaluating the magnitude of benefit from new cancer therapies against a backdrop of a rapidly evolving clinical trial landscape,"" says ESMO President Fabrice André. ""As a trusted guide for treatment decision-making, ESMO-MCBS ensures that the benefits and toxicities of treatments are thoroughly assessed, which leads to better-informed clinical decisions and ultimately better care for patients,"" he says.

The development of ESMO-MCBS v2.0 involved a transparent process with extensive peer review, appeal, and revision opportunities. This ensures the accountability for reasonableness of the scores, making the scale a trusted decision-support tool. The amendments incorporated into ESMO-MCBS v2.0 will be applied to the ESMO-MCBS Scorecards ensuring all current and future evaluations reflect the updated scoring methodology.",https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250523/ESMO-releases-updated-scale-to-measure-clinical-benefit-of-cancer-treatments.aspx,Business

Disposable vapes ban: Why people are stockpiling ahead of June deadline,"'I don't know what we'll do' - Vapers panic-buy ahead of disposables ban

13 hours ago Share Save Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter Share Save

Cara Hallinan Cara is stockpiling ahead of the ban and says she is hoping to buy enough disposable vapes to last her through the summer

Cara Hallinan says she and many of her friends are feeling very nervous about the looming disposable vape ban. In fact, she says: ""I'm not sure what we are going to do."" The 25-year-old took up vaping five years ago. One of her friends gave her a puff on theirs and that was it, she could finally wean herself off cigarettes. Cara says it was cherry fizz flavoured vapes which helped her quit her 20-a-day smoking habit, and now, as the ban looms, she's buying as many as she can before they become illegal to sell or supply across the UK. ""I've been buying boxes of them from my local discount store. They're trying to get rid of them, so I've been getting ten vapes for £20."" Cara says she's got about 40 vapes now, enough to last a few weeks, but she wants to stockpile enough to get her through the summer - because she's scared of going back to smoking.

Cara Hallinan Cara says she has been buying boxes of vapes from her local discount store and she will continue until the ban comes in

From 1 June, it will be illegal to buy or sell disposable vapes. Only devices considered to be reusable will be legal. They must have a rechargeable battery, a replaceable coil and be refillable. Cara understands there will still be a wide variety of vapes out there to buy, but she's not convinced they will work for her. ""With everything else going on in my life, what if I forget to recharge my vape? And then I wake up one morning without a vape, or I run out of charge at work? ""I'm used to the ease of being able to buy a disposable one when I need."" Cara is one of more than three million ex-smokers who have made the switch from cigarettes to vapes over the past few years. While vapes are considered a healthier alternative to cigarettes, there are concerns that vaping provides a gateway into nicotine addiction - with disposable vapes enticing children and young people with their fruity flavours and cheap prices. Even though rechargeable vapes are the most popular, there are still around 30% of vapers who prefer to use disposable vapes.

""One of the big attractions is ease of use,"" Dan Marchant, owner of online retailer, Vape Club, and co-founder of the UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA), says. ""Buying a disposable vape is like buying a packet of cigarettes – just nip to the shop and get one over the counter."" He says he's seen sales of the most popular flavours of vapes double over the past few weeks as some customers stock up. Another online retailer, Haypp, has also seen sales rise ahead of the ban. Haypp's scientific director, Dr Marina Murphy, said: ""Daily sales are now regularly surpassing even our Black Friday peaks, which had previously been our biggest sales days."" Some are worried about the change in taste. Disposable vapes tend to be sweeter than refillable vapes due to them often having more sweeteners and nicotine salts in the E-liquid.

'Smoker of the year award'

After 40 years of chain-smoking cigarettes, Baroness Claire Fox of Buckley says it was the strawberry and banana flavour disposable vapes that finally helped her quit. ""They worked a treat and for the past 18 months I have been smoke-free."" The 64-year-old peer admits it wasn't easy, but after being advised by two doctors to try vapes, she's gone from being the ""proud winner of the smoker of the year award"" to a life free from the harms of tobacco.

Andrew Firth Baroness Fox smoked for 40 years but says she finally stopped 18 months ago with the help of strawberry and banana flavoured disposable vapes

And now, she says, she is dreading 1 June when the disposable vape ban comes in. ""I've been stocking up with stashes of brightly-coloured vape boxes both at home and at work. ""The rechargables have a metallic, battery taste which I don't like."" She says disposable vapes have had a ""miraculous impact on smoking levels"". ""Finally, we have a smoking cessation device that works and we ban it - it's counter- productive and daft."" The outspoken peer, who often berates legislation she sees as infringing civil liberties, says environmental concerns are clearly trumping public health concerns.

The UK government wants to reduce the impact on the environment – an estimated five million disposable vapes were thrown away every week last year – and cut the number of children and young people vaping. Health experts agree anyone who does not smoke should not start vaping, as it may cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains.

A Censuswide poll, commissioned by Vape Club, asked 2,000 vapers across the UK how their habits were going to change in the wake of the ban next month. While 49% of people who use disposable vapes said they were going to switch to different types of rechargeable devices, and 16% said they were going to stop vaping altogether, it has also produced some ""worrying results"", Mr Marchant says. ""We found that 11% said they were going to stockpile after the ban - by going abroad and buying from countries where disposables are sold legally and then bringing them back into the UK. ""And more worryingly, 18% said if they couldn't get hold of disposable vapes they would go back to smoking after the ban comes in.""

Ruth Clegg Nick says he's going to have to throw out £6,000 worth of disposable vapes when the ban comes in

This is something, Nick, who owns Mist Vapes, recognises, as he points to the local newsagent a few shops down the road in Whalley Range, south Manchester. ""Many of my regular customers say they will stop vaping when the ban comes in, instead of coming here, they'll go to Booze and Cigs down the road and pick up a pack of cigarettes and go back to smoking."" He is worried about the future of his business. He points to the rows of pastel-coloured boxes, lined up on shelves that cover a whole wall in his shop. There are popular flavours like pineapple ice, rainbow and blueberry sour. ""They'll have to go,"" he says. ""And that's nearly £6,000 worth of stock down the drain.

Guselkumab Demonstrates Rapid and Lasting Results in Crohn Disease,"Guselkumab delivered subcutaneously showed strong and sustained benefits in achieving both clinical remission and endoscopic response, without added safety concerns, in adults with moderate to severe Crohn disease, according to new data.1

The data, collected through a phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, treat-through GRAVITI study (NCT05197049), helps to clarify support the May 2025 approval of subcutaneous guselkumab (Tremfya; Johnson & Johnson) for Crohn disease. | Image credit: New Africa - stock.adobe.com



The data, collected through a phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, treat-through GRAVITI study (NCT05197049), help to support the May 2025 approval of subcutaneous guselkumab (Tremfya; Johnson & Johnson) for Crohn disease.1,2 The study was conducted to address the ongoing need for more effective, safer, and more convenient treatment options for Crohn disease by evaluating whether a fully subcutaneous guselkumab regimen, reducing the need for intravenous induction, could offer a patient-friendly alternative without compromising efficacy or safety.1

Adults aged 18 or older with active disease confirmed by radiologic, histologic, or endoscopic criteria and meeting specific symptom severity thresholds (eg, Crohn Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score between 220-450, stool frequency, and abdominal pain) were eligible for inclusion. All participants also needed to have endoscopic evidence of active disease with ulceration and must have failed or been intolerant to conventional or biologic treatments, though prior exposure to interleukin (IL)-12/23 or IL-23 inhibitors excluded them.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive guselkumab at different dosing regimens or placebo, with stratification based on baseline disease severity and biologic failure status. Blinding was maintained through matched placebo injections and sham rescue procedures.

Participants were followed through a 48-week blinded period, during which clinical, endoscopic, biomarker, quality-of-life, and safety data were collected. The primary efficacy end points were clinical remission (CDAI < 150) and endoscopic response (Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease [SES-CD] reduction ≥ 50%) at week 12, with additional outcomes measured through week 48, including biomarker changes, endoscopic remission, and patient-reported outcomes.

In a study of 347 participants with moderate to severe Crohn disease, patients were randomized to receive guselkumab 400 mg SC followed by either 100 mg every 8 weeks, 200 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo. By week 16, more placebo patients (37.6%) required rescue treatment compared with guselkumab groups (12.2%), and early discontinuation was more common with placebo (10.3% vs 1.3%). By week 48, treatment discontinuation remained highest in the placebo group (26.5%) vs guselkumab groups (4.3%-15.3%).

Baseline demographics were similar across groups: 58.5% male, mean age 37.5 years, disease duration 8 years. About 46.4% had prior biologic failure, mostly anti-TNF, while 46.4% were bionaive. Most had elevated C-reactive protein levels (54.8%) and fecal calprotectin (71.7%).

At week 12, guselkumab showed significantly higher clinical remission (56.1% vs 21.4%), endoscopic response (41.3% vs 21.4%), and remission according to patient-reported outcomes (49.1% vs 17.1%) compared with placebo (P < .001 for all). These improvements continued through week 48, with clinical remission of 60.0% to 66.1% and endoscopic response of 44.3% to 51.3% in guselkumab groups vs 17.1% and 6.8% with placebo, respectively (P < .001). Endoscopic remission and deep remission were also significantly higher in both guselkumab groups.

“In conclusion, SC induction followed by SC maintenance treatment with guselkumab resulted in superior clinical and endoscopic improvements in participants with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease through 48 weeks compared with placebo,” the authors concluded.

Toyoda, the grandson of the company's founder and previously its chief executive, has seen shareholder support slip in recent years. He was re-elected to the board with backing from 72% of the shareholders in 2024, down from 85% and 96%, respectively, in the prior two years.

In a July 2024 interview by the automaker's own news outlet, Toyoda said that his seat on the board could be at risk if shareholder support continued to fall. He said then that the 2024 result marked the lowest support rating ever for a director in Toyota's history.

In addition to Glass Lewis, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has also recommended shareholders re-elect Toyoda this year, in contrast to last year when it recommended a vote against him.

HOUSTON, May 23 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have given Venture Global (VG.N) , opens new tab permission to proceed with construction of its CP2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Louisiana, a FERC document showed on Friday.

If constructed, CP2 will be the single largest LNG export facility in the U.S. and help the country remain the world's largest exporter of the superchilled gas. It also could make Venture Global the largest U.S. LNG company

Sign up here.

The decision follows a final environmental study that shows the 28 million metric tons per annum plant is in the public interest.

Venture Global had obtained approval to construct the plant, but after a court ruling, FERC conducted an additional environmental review of the impact on air quality.

The study concluded that the project should be allowed to continue.

""Neither the presumptive stay ...nor the Commission’s regulations barring construction for a limited period pending rehearing will apply upon issuance of this order,"" federal regulators said.

With federal approvals in hand, the company will immediately launch on-site construction for the project, the company's CEO Mike Sabel said on Friday.

The additional review followed an August 2024 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that quashed FERC approval of rival LNG exporter NextDecade's (NEXT.O) , opens new tab plant at the Port of Brownsville, Texas. In light of the court ruling, FERC decided to review the CP2 project's impact on air quality.

CP2 has been at the center of a fight between the energy sector and environmentalists seeking to limit future LNG projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

China's digital product sales rise on subsidy support,"China's digital product sales rise on subsidy support

BEIJING, May 23 -- Sales of digital products in China have expanded over the past few months, spurred by a government-backed subsidy program, the Ministry of Commerce said Friday.

As of Thursday, over 48 million consumers had participated in the digital products subsidy scheme, buying a total of 51.48 million products and generating about 143.3 billion yuan (about 19.9 billion U.S. dollars) in sales, data from the ministry showed.

From January to April, total retail sales of communication appliances surged 25.4 percent from a year ago, representing the fastest growth among 16 major consumer goods categories, the data showed.

The ministry said that subsidy policies for digital products have facilitated an upgrade towards higher-end products in the market. Third-party data showed that the sales volume of smartphones priced between 2,000 to 4,000 yuan rose 13 percent year on year in the first four months, while those in the 4,000 to 6,000 yuan range saw sales jump 43 percent.

China launched the subsidy program in January, as part of broader efforts to bolster domestic consumption. Under the plan, consumers purchasing smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, or wristbands priced below 6,000 yuan per item are eligible for a subsidy covering 15 percent of the sales price, up to a maximum of 500 yuan per item.

The program applies to both domestic and foreign brands.",https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/statistics/202505/24/content_WS68311030c6d0868f4e8f2cc7.html,Business

McDonald's is closing its CosMc's restaurants but plans to test drinks the chain 'inspired'

McDonald’s said Friday that it’s closing down CosMc’s, a new restaurant format it began piloting in the U.S. last year.

But the company said beverages inspired by CosMc’s will soon be tested at U.S. McDonald’s locations. Among the drinks on CosMc’s current menu: a matcha iced latte, a turmeric spiced latte, a prickly pear-flavored slushy with popping candy on top and a frozen sour cherry energy drink.

McDonald’s announced in late 2023 that it wanted to test a small-format store with customizable drinks and treats that would appeal to afternoon snackers – and potentially grab sales from rivals like Starbucks and Dutch Bros. McDonald's sales often slump in the afternoon between mealtimes and the company wants to change that.

“This is a $100 billion category that’s growing faster than the rest of (casual dining) and with superior margins. And it’s a space that we believe we have the right to win,” McDonald’s Chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski said at the time.

But Kempczinski said CosMc’s drinks might be too complex to fit in with regular McDonald’s store operations.

McDonald’s wound up opening one CosMc’s location near its headquarters in Chicago and seven in Texas. Five locations remain, but the company plans to shut them all down by the end of June. The company is also shutting down CosMc’s app.

McDonald’s said CosMc’s allowed it to experiment with bold flavors and different technologies, like drive-thru lanes that manage traffic based on the complexity of orders. It was also able to quickly edit the menu based on customer feedback.",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mcdonalds-closing-cosmcs-restaurants-plans-test-drinks-chain-122130310,Business

Money Movement in Focus as Bank De Novo Activity Accelerates,"Highlights Nonbanks, including FinTechs like Fiserv and Stripe, are increasingly applying for bank charters to gain inroads into processing transactions and connecting directly to payment infrastructure. This trend comes against a backdrop of previously muted de novo activity, with regulators potentially easing the application process. Specific limited purpose charters, such as Merchant Acquirer Limited Purpose Banks in Georgia and proposed “payments banks” in Nevada, are emerging that allow connection to rails like FedNow and merchant acquiring activities but prohibit lending. Nevada’s proposed bill specifically aims to create banks for money movement. Securing direct access through these limited charters allows nonbanks and potentially retailers to connect directly to real-time rails, building new revenue streams and foster stronger relationships with merchants.

In recent months, nonbanks have been applying for banking charters.

Against a backdrop where de novo activity has been muted through the past several years, regulators have been moving to ease the bank application process. In a speech earlier this year, FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said that since the start of 2010, the total number of new banks formed over 15 years is 86, which averages to less than six annually. In previous years the average was 93, annually. Legislation introduced in the Senate this year, the “Promoting New Bank Formation Act of 2025,” would, among other things, give newer banks more time to meet capital requirements for those formations.

In Capitol Hill coverage, PYMNTS wrote that founders of newer banks told lawmakers that lengthy application processes stretched out over several months and presented challenges in terms of compliance with regulatory documentation.

The applications from the likes of Fiserv and Stripe point to interest from FinTechs in finding ways to secure inroads into processing transactions. In Georgia, the pursuit of Merchant Acquirer Limited Purpose Bank charters would help applicants expand their operations, but it’s important to note that the charters would not allow for lending.

Connecting New Banks to the Rails

In Nevada, the recent introduction of Assembly Bill 500, titled the “Nevada Payments Bank Act” would create new banks that exist for the purpose of money movement. The bill would let new banks connect, directly, to payments infrastructure including FedNow.

The door would be open, then, for FinTechs to connect directly to real-time rails. Beyond the scope of those firms, other nonbanks, including retailers, would be able to gain direct access to money movement, which, according to the bill’s sponsors, would lower transaction costs. Those lower costs would come through skirting interchange fees.

As for the limited scope of the activities of these new banks, they would be prohibited from “lending related” offerings and activities.

The Act notes that “a payments bank, with certain exceptions, has all the powers, privileges and authorities that a state bank or national bank has, including, engaging in money transmission, engaging in activities … and the conducting of merchant acquiring activities, which [means] … effecting transactions within payment card networks.” The Act also notes that there’s a revenue stream created for the state, as the “bill requires a payments bank to pay to the Commissioner a fee equal to 0.0025 percent of each transaction effectuated through the merchant acquiring activities of the payments bank.”

In an exploration of money movement ecosystems, PYMNTS Intelligence wrote, “At its core, the money mobility ecosystem revolves around four key elements: the payment; the account; the funding mechanics of money in, money out; and the clearing, settlement and reconciliation of the flow of funds in and out.” The direct connection to the payment rails and the card rails, as these charters are pursued and granted, would allow these (limited in scope) banks to serve merchants in new ways and in turn, forge stickier relationships with those merchants.",https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2025/money-movement-in-focus-as-bank-de-novo-activity-accelerates/,Business

"Australia begins cleanup after floods kill 5, strand thousands","Hundreds of residents remain in evacuation centres, with 52 rescues made overnight despite conditions easing.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced the start of a cleanup operation in eastern Australia after record-breaking floods killed five people and stranded tens of thousands of people.

Damage assessments are under way for the coastal region of New South Wales in the east, where at least 10,000 properties are thought to have been damaged, the state’s emergency services agency said on Saturday.

Conditions have eased since Friday after days of relentless rain isolated towns, swept away livestock and destroyed homes, the agency added.

“We’re continuing to work closely across federal, state and local governments to make sure Australians get the support they need now and through recovery,” Albanese posted on X.

Despite improving conditions, hundreds of residents remain in evacuation centres with 52 rescues made overnight, State Emergency Services commissioner Mike Wassing said.

The death toll from flooding rose to five after a man in his 80s was found at a flooded property about 50km (32 miles) from Taree, one of the worst-hit towns, police said.

It’s “awful to hear the news of more loss of life”, Albanese said after being forced to cancel his trip to Taree on Friday due to floodwaters.

At their worst, the flooding isolated about 50,000 people and submerged roads in the country’s most populous state.

Coastal areas were left littered with debris and dead animals after a powerful storm system dumped months’ worth of rain in three days.

Train services, including airport services, were affected by flooded tracks. Sydney airport shut two of its three runways for an hour on Friday morning, delaying flights.

Australia has suffered a series of extreme weather events in recent years, which experts have attributed to climate change.

Frequent flooding has caused widespread devastation in the country since early 2021, following droughts and bushfires at the end of the last decade.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/24/australia-begins-clean-up-after-floods-kill-5-strand-thousands,World
Xi extends condolences over death of former Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong,"BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday extended condolences to General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee To Lam and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong over the death of former Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong.

In his message, Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, expressed profound condolences and extended sincere sympathies to Tran Duc Luong's family on behalf of the CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

Xi hailed Comrade Tran Duc Luong as an outstanding party and state leader of Vietnam who made important contributions to the country's development and its cause of Doi Moi (reform).

As an old friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Tran Duc Luong made unremitting efforts to promote the development of relations between the two parties and the two countries, Xi said.

Xi expressed his belief that under the strong leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Comrade To Lam, the party, government and people of Vietnam will surely turn their grief into strength and continue to achieve new accomplishments in the cause of socialist construction. ■",https://english.news.cn/20250524/ec98870720a4418eb7bfe321bd7a2be3/c.html,World
Labour figures urge recognition of Palestinian state at UN conference,"Ministers are under pressure from inside and outside Labour to recognise Palestinian statehood at a UN conference next month, with party grandees arguing it would bolster prospects for peace and demonstrate moral leadership amid escalating tensions.



Alf Dubs, the veteran Labour peer and Holocaust survivor, said the symbolic recognition of a Palestinian state would offer Palestinians “the self-respect they’d have if they had a proper state,” and provide them a stronger footing in any future peace negotiations.

“Even if it doesn’t lead to anything immediately, it would still give Palestinians a better standing,” Lord Dubs said. “Symbols matter.”



The former cabinet minister Peter Hain echoed the call, warning that “delaying recognition until negotiations are concluded simply allows Israel’s illegal occupation to become permanent”. Lord Hain argued that formal recognition should be “a catalyst, not a consequence” of peace talks.

At the first preparatory meeting in New York before a UN conference on a two state solution due to be held between 17 and 20 June, Saudi Arabia urged countries to recognise Palestine as a state, saying that “recognition should be seen as a precondition for peace, and not its product”.

The conference is seen as a potential moment when states such as France and the UK that have yet to recognise Palestine take what would be a momentous diplomatic step.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, indicated last month that Paris may recognise Palestine, joining 147 other countries, but said he wanted to do so at a UN conference in New York in June as part of a wider process.

The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, has confirmed to parliament he has been in discussions with the French about recognition, but also said he would not simply support a gesture with no practical impact.

The Guardian reported last week that the British view is that France was very likely to decide the time was not right to make the announcement. The UK’s official position is that it will recognise a Palestinian state, but only at the point of maximum impact.

The pressure has been building within Labour’s parliamentary ranks as 69 MPs and six peers earlier this month signed a joint letter urging the prime minister to seize what they described as a “unique window of opportunity” to recognise Palestinian statehood.

The Guardian understands that the letter – which was coordinated by the chairs of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East, Sarah Owen and Andrew Pakes – was also signed by several serving ministers.

In a concept note for June’s UN conference, France and Saudi Arabia, the two co-chairs of the conference say the ambitious aim of the international conference in June “would not be to ‘revive’ or to ‘relaunch’ another endless process, but to implement, once and for all, the two-state solution”.

The call to implement the two-state solution has become even more urgent in the context of illegal settlements and other illegal unilateral measures, violence, hate speech and the ongoing plans and actions undertaken for the forcible displacement and dispossession of Palestinians.

With eight working parties covering all the issues surrounding a two-state solution, each nation has been asked “to highlight the actions they are willing to undertake, individually or collectively, in fulfilment of their obligations and in support of the international consensus on the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the two-state solution”.

Alex Ballinger, a Labour backbencher and member of the foreign affairs select committee, said it was time for the UK to “show principled leadership,” adding: “We can no longer speak in platitudes about two states while blocking the very steps that could help make one of them real.”



Afzal Khan, a former shadow minister and longtime campaigner on Palestinian rights, said Labour must act on its internationalist values. “Recognition would now be a positive first step towards securing a peaceful two-state solution, end unlawful settlement expansions and blockades, and unlock the diplomatic and humanitarian pathways to lasting justice,” he said, warning that the UK risks “dragging its feet” while 147 other countries have already recognised a Palestinian state.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/24/labour-figures-urge-recognition-of-palestinian-state-at-un-conference,World
US and Iran try to bridge chasm on nuclear enrichment,"DUBAI: Iranian and US negotiators resumed talks on Friday in Rome to resolve a decades-long dispute over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, Iranian media reported, despite Tehran warning that a new deal might not be possible amid mutually exclusive demands.

The stakes are high for both sides. President Don­ald Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a reg­i­onal nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel.

The Islamic Republic, for its part, wants to be rid of devastating sanctions on its oil-based economy. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff were expected to lead a fifth round of talks, through Omani mediators.

“This round of talks is especially sensitive ... we need to see what issues will be raised by the other party ... and based on that, we will proceed with our positions,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei told state TV in Rome.

Both Washington and Tehran have taken a tough stance in public over Iran’s intensifying uranium enrichment programme, which could potentially give it scope to build a nuclear warhead, even though Tehran says it has no such ambitions and the purposes are purely civilian.

Iran insists the talks are indirect, but US officials have said the discussions — including the latest round on May 11 in Oman — have been both “direct and indirect”.

Ahead of the talks, Araqchi wrote on X: “...Zero nuclear weapons = we Do have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal. Time to decide.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that Trump believes negotiations with Iran are “moving in the right direction”.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on matters of state, rejected demands to stop refining uranium as “excessive and outrageous”, warning that such talks were unlikely to yield results. .

"UN says Gaza in 'cruellest phase' of war as 9,000 trucks' worth of aid ready at border","UN warns over risk of famine while aid trickles into Gaza

Palestinians are living through ""the cruellest phase"" of the war between Israel and Hamas, the UN secretary-general has warned today.

An Israeli-enforced aid blockade on Gaza has partially eased, with about 130 aid lorries crossing into the territory in recent days. But one Gazan told the BBC earlier that the help they are seeing is just a ""drop in the ocean"" of what's needed.

The UN estimates that at least 600 aid trucks are needed every day to start addressing Gaza's humanitarian crisis.

An arm of the Israeli government, Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat), earlier said ""there is no food shortage in Gaza at this time"".

Meanwhile, Israel's military operation continues. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, 60 people were killed and 185 wounded in Gaza in the 24 hours to midday today.

The ministry adds that 53,822 people have now been killed since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

This morning, the Israeli military reported having hit ""over 75 targets"" in the past day, insisting the war will continue to ""defend its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction"".

DAMASCUS, Syria -- Syria welcomed Saturday the move by the Trump administration to ease sanctions imposed on the war-torn country, calling it a “positive step” to ease humanitarian and economic suffering.

A statement by the foreign ministry said Syria “extends its hand” to anyone that wants to cooperate with Damascus, on the condition that there is no intervention in the country’s internal affairs.

Saturday’s statement came a day after the Trump administration granted Syria sweeping exemptions from sanctions in a major first step toward fulfilling the president’s pledge to lift a half-century of penalties on a country shattered by 14 years of civil war.

A measure by the State Department waived for six months a tough set of sanctions imposed by Congress in 2019. A Treasury Department action suspended enforcement of sanctions against anyone doing business with a range of Syrian individuals and entities, including Syria’s central bank.

The congressional sanctions, known as the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, had aimed to isolate Syria’s previous rulers by effectively expelling those doing business with them from the global financial system. They specifically block postwar reconstruction, so while they can be waived for 180 days by executive order, investors are likely to be wary of reconstruction projects when sanctions could be reinstated after six months.

The Trump administration said Friday’s actions were “just one part of a broader U.S. government effort to remove the full architecture of sanctions.” Those penalties had been imposed on the Assad family for their support of Iranian-backed militias, their chemical weapons program and abuses of civilians.

Trump said during a visit to the region earlier this month that the U.S. would roll back the heavy financial penalties in a bid to give the interim government a better chance of survival.

Damascus resident Nael Kaddah said now that the sanctions are being eased, the country will flourish again. He said Syrians will be able to transfer money freely, unlike in the past when there were several companies that monopolized the business and took large commissions on transfers.

“Now any citizen can receive a transfer from anywhere in the world,” he said.

Syria’s foreign ministry said dialogue and diplomacy are the best way to build “balanced relations that achieve the interest of the people and strengthen security and stability in the region.”

It added that the coming period in Syria will be reconstruction and restoring “Syria’s natural status” in the region and around the world.",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/syria-welcomes-us-move-ease-sanctions-imposed-122153020,World
UN chief slams ‘cruelest phase’ of Gaza conflict,"UNITED NATIONS: Uni­t­ed Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Friday said “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring what may be the cruelest phase of this cruel conflict” as Israel ramps up its military offensive.

“For nearly 80 days, Israel blocked the entry of life-saving international aid,” he said in a statement. “The entire population of Gaza is facing the risk of famine.

“The Israeli military offensive is intensifying with atrocious levels of death and destruction.

“Today, 80 per cent of Gaza has been either designated an Israeli-militarised zone or an area where people have been ordered to leave.”

More than 50 Palestinians dead or missing in Israeli strike on Jabalia

Aid also began trickling into the Gaza Strip on Monday for the first time in more than two months, amid condemnation of the Israeli blockade that sparked severe shortages of food and medicine.

“Israel has clear obligations under international humanitarian law,” Guterres said. “As the occupying power, it must agree to allow and facilitate the aid that is needed,” he said.

More than 50 Palestinians were killed or went missing after an Israeli air strike on a residential building in the Jabalia al-Balad area of northern Gaza, Palestinian Civil Defence sources say.

Israeli drones targeted more than five locations near the entrance to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza on Friday morning, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.

When people rushed to help the victims, Israeli forces attacked them again, injuring several more Palestinians.

Separately, three people, including a young girl, lost their lives in an Israeli airstrike on an apartment near Abdel Aal junction on al-Jalaa Street in Gaza City.

Two siblings were killed, and their father suffered critical injuries when an Israeli strike hit a home in the western camp area of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.

In eastern Khan Yunis, several casualties are reported after Israeli forces struck a home in the town of Abasan al-Kabira.

Israeli air strikes also killed at least six Palestinians guarding aid trucks against looters, Hamas officials said, underlining the problems hindering supplies from reaching hungry people in Gaza following Israel’s 11-week-long blockade.

The Israeli military claimed 107 trucks carrying flour and other foodstuffs as well as medical supplies, entered the Gaza Strip from the Kerem Shalom crossing point on Thursday. But getting the supplies to people sheltering in tents and other makeshift accommodations has been fitful.

So far, an umbrella network of Palestinian aid groups said, 119 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Israel eased its blockade on Monday in the face of an international outcry.

But distribution has been hampered by looting by groups of men, some of them armed, near the city of Khan Yunis, the network said.

A Hamas official said six members of a security team tasked with guarding the shipments were killed. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

The aid groups network also said the amount of aid coming into Gaza was still inadequate and only included a narrow range of supplies. It said Israel’s agreement to allow trucks to enter the war-shattered enclave was a “deceptive manoeuvre” to avoid international pressure calling for the lifting of the blockade.

An Israeli air strike on Gaza hit the home of a doctor and killed nine of her 10 children, the hospital where she works in the city of Khan Younis says. Nasser hospital said one of Dr Alaa al-Najjar's children and her husband were injured, but survived. Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital, said he had operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy. A video shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry and verified by the BBC showed small burned bodies lifted from the rubble of a strike in Khan Younis. Israel's military said its aircraft had struck ""a number of suspects"" in Khan Younis on Friday, and ""the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review"".

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its ""aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis"". ""The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety,"" the Israeli military said. In a general statement on Saturday, the IDF said it had struck more than 100 targets across Gaza over the past day. The health ministry said at least 74 people had been killed by the Israeli military over the 24 hour-period leading up to about midday on Saturday. Dr Muneer Alboursh, director of the health ministry, said on X that the al-Najjars' family house was hit minutes after Dr al-Najjar's husband Hamdi had returned home after driving his wife to work. Dr Alboursh said the eldest of Dr al-Najjar's children was aged 12. Mr Groom said that the children's father was ""very badly injured"", in a video posted on the Instagram account of another British surgeon working at Nasser hospital, Victoria Rose. He said he had asked about the father, also a doctor at the hospital, and had been told he had ""no political and no military connections and doesn't seem to be prominent on social media"". He described it as an ""unimaginable"" situation for Dr Alaa al-Najjar.

Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, said on Telegram on Friday afternoon that his teams had recovered eight bodies and several injured from the al-Najjar house near a petrol station in Khan Younis. The hospital initially posted on Facebook that eight children had been killed, then two hours later updated that number to nine. Another doctor, Youssef Abu al-Rish, said in a statement posted by the health ministry that he had arrived to the operating room to find Dr al-Najjar waiting for information about her surviving son and tried to console her. In an interview recorded by AFP news agency, relative Youssef al-Najjar said: ""Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us. ""We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!""

On Friday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that people in Gaza were enduring what may be ""the cruellest phase"" of the war, and denounced Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid imposed in March. Israel partially lifted the blockade earlier this week. Israeli military body Cogat said 83 more trucks carrying flour, food, medical equipment pharmaceutical drugs entered Gaza on Friday. The UN has repeatedly said the amount of aid entering is nowhere near enough for the territory's 2.1 million people - saying between 500 to 600 trucks a day are needed - and has called for Israel to allow in much more. The limited amount of food that trickled into Gaza this week sparked chaotic scenes, with armed looters attacking an aid convoy and Palestinians crowding outside bakeries in a desperate attempt to obtain bread.

Words are not enough – action is needed now to stop Israel’s siege of Gaza

Israel’s allies are finally speaking up against the intolerable suffering Israel is inflicting on the people of Gaza. But strong statements are not enough. It is beyond time for states to end military and security cooperation with Israel and take concrete measures to inhibit Israel’s capacity to commit crimes against the populations of Gaza and the West Bank.

On 19 May, the UK, France and Canada issued a joint statement which demands that Israel cease the renewed military offensive and immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. At the same time, 27 donor countries and the EU called for a full resumption of aid into Gaza which respects humanitarian principles. While these statements are welcome, it is already too late for many civilians in Gaza, which underlines the urgent need for immediate action.

Starvation in Gaza is not only the consequence of the last 11 weeks, in which no humanitarian aid has been allowed to enter Gaza, but also of the near-total destruction of the Gaza Strip wrought by the Israeli Defence Forces since October 2023. 80% of Gazans were already dependent on humanitarian aid before the war due to Israel’s long-running blockade on the territory.

UN special rapporteurs and human rights organisations have described Israel’s conduct as constituting a genocide, a crime against humanity. In early May Benyamin Netanyahu’s government declared the aims of its renewed offensive include Israel’s intention to retain a permanent presence in Gaza and population transfer, which would amount to ethnic cleansing.

The gravity of Israel’s ongoing crimes in Gaza – together with the illegal occupation of the West Bank – make it clear that sustained delivery of adequate levels of humanitarian aid without impediment is a necessary, but not sufficient, step. Too often Israel’s allies have chosen to point towards delivery of some humanitarian aid as the test of Israel’s appropriate conduct: calls for the free flow of aid must go hand in hand with clear messages on the need to end the military operations and occupation which have created the need for this aid. Humanitarian aid must not be a figleaf for the continuation of the war.

Israel’s allies and other states have waited too long to apply measures that could materially impact Israel, contributing to a lack of accountability which has enabled its conduct. States that have continued to export arms to Israel have been complicit in its commission of crimes, which have included mass killing of civilians through explosive weapons, deliberate starvation, the systematic destruction of hospitals and use of sexual and gender-based violence.

At a minimum, all states and multilateral organisations, such as the EU must:

Apply a full suspension of any military/security cooperation with Israel, including a two-way arms embargo and a cessation of any training and intelligence support. Those states that are part of the F-35 global programme must stop providing any components either directly or indirectly to Israel.

Pro-actively support efforts towards accountability, including the International Criminal Court’s efforts to prosecute all those responsible for war crimes on 7 October 2023 and after, and the opinions and proceedings of the International Court of Justice.

The EU must immediately suspend its Association Agreement with Israel.

Such actions need to remain in place until there is a negotiated end to the current system of apartheid and illegal military occupation. A partial lifting of the blockade, or a reduction in the Israeli presence in Gaza, or a halt to the expansion of current settlements in the West Bank, are not sufficient to permit a return to business as usual.

The first step towards a more peaceful future for Palestinians and Israelis rests on a return to meaningful negotiations, which requires Israel to end its current assault on Gaza and recognise the humanity of Palestinians. The deep-rooted injustices at the heart of this conflict can no longer be swept under the carpet.

German woman arrested after mass stabbing at Hamburg train station,"Police say four victims face life-threatening injuries, suggest suspect may have have suffered a ‘psychological emergency’.

Authorities in Germany have arrested a woman charged with stabbing at least 18 people at the main train station in the northern city of Hamburg.

The 39-year-old German woman appeared before a judge on Saturday, as police continued to investigate the knife attack during Friday evening’s rush hour, which left at least four of the victims with life-threatening injuries.

“We have no evidence so far that the woman may have had a political motive,” police spokesman Florian Abbenseth told journalists on Friday.

“Rather, we have information, based on which we now want to investigate, whether she may have been experiencing a psychological emergency.”

The suspect was thought to have “acted alone”, Hamburg police said in a post on X.

Images of the scene showed access to the platforms at one end of the station blocked off by police and people being loaded into waiting ambulances.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed his shock in a call with the mayor of Hamburg following the attack.

Germany has been rocked in recent months by a series of violent attacks that have put security at the top of the agenda.

The most recent, on May 18, saw four people injured in a stabbing at a bar in the city of Bielefeld. The investigation into that attack had been handed over to federal prosecutors following the arrest of the suspect, who is from Syria.

"‘A silent crisis’: Obstetric fistula affects 500,000 women, yet it’s fully treatable","16 years – that is how long Dah had to live with the agonising condition, undergoing eight different surgical procedures before finally getting the fistula repaired.

In recognition of the over 500,000 women like Dah who are forced to endure what is a highly treatable condition, the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula is being marked on Friday.

Obstetric fistula is a medical condition which refers to the development of a small hole between the birth canal and the bladder or rectum, leading to leaking urine or faeces.

This year’s theme, “Her Health, Her Right: Shaping a Future without Fistula” will seek to make progress towards the goal of eliminating fistula by 2030.

Women’s bodies become battlegrounds — not only through sexual violence but through deliberate denial of reproductive rights and health

– Sima Bahous, Executive Director of UN Women

“Women’s bodies become battlegrounds — not only through sexual violence but through the deliberate denial of reproductive rights and health services” said Sima Bahous, Executive Director of UN Women.

‘A silent crisis’

It is often brought on by prolonged or difficult childbirth. Most of the half million women suffering the condition live in the Global South.

Many women who have a fistula experience social isolation and exclusion brought on by leaking urine or faeces. This, in turn, can lead to depression and exacerbated poverty.

Kambiré, a small business owner who lives in Bouna, lived with obstetric fistula for 23 years. She even had another child before getting medical assistance.

“I preferred to isolate myself because of the fistula,” she said. “I couldn't sit for long for fear of getting wet.”

She only learned that it was treatable when listening to a radio show, inspiring her to go to a UN sexual and reproductive health agency (UNFPA)-supported hospital for treatment. Now, she owns a small pot-making business.

© UNFPA/Ollivier Girard Kambiré had obstetric fistula for 23 years and now owns her own pot-making business.

Entirely preventable and treatable

UNFPA set the goal of elimination by 2030 - which seems doable given that, as a medical condition, it is both completely preventable and fully treatable.

Between 2003 and 2024, UNFPA supported nearly 150,000 surgical fistula repairs, 4,400 of which alone happened in Côte d’Ivoire for women like Dah and Kambiré.

Catherine, a mother of two in Bouna, also received medical assistance from a UNFPA-supported hospital.

“Now that I’m healthy, I’m happy. I can run my business and spend time with my friends,” she said.

Nevertheless, obstetric fistula has remained stubbornly persistent throughout the world due to disparities in global health systems.

UNFPA says that midwives are key to preventing fistula, and other childbirth injuries. However, there is a global shortage of over 900,000 midwives, 500,000 of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Reproductive health education and empowerment are similarly essential to addressing and preventing obstetric fistula.

“The most effective shield we can offer women and girls is their own power, voice and leadership,” Ms. Bahous said.

Networks of solidarity

After Dah received successful treatment for her obstetric fistula, she, like Kambiré, began a seasonal food business through which she prepares and sells produce.

She has also banded together with other fistula survivors from Bouna to enhance community awareness and reduce stigma.

“When women lead, they protect not only themselves but their families and communities … The impact is transformative,” Ms. Bahous said.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1163621,World
Israeli settlers force about 150 Palestinians to leave their West Bank village,"Violent Israeli settlers including two under UK sanctions have forced about 150 Palestinians to leave their village in the occupied West Bank, through a five-day intimidation campaign carried out under the watch of the Israeli police and army.

On Sunday morning, settlers established an illegal outpost, consisting of a basic shelter and a sheep pen, 100 metres from a Palestinian home in Mughayyir al-Deir, east of Ramallah. By Friday, dozens of villagers had already moved their flocks away, packed up their belongings and were dismantling the wooden and metal frames of their houses.

Settlers stalked between Palestinian men who worked fast and largely in silence, grappling with the grim reality of leaving the place where most were born and grew up. A child cried as he was driven away on a truck loaded with the family’s red sofas.

“We are all leaving,” said one villager, who asked not to be named. Settlers threw stones at some trucks as they left, and celebrated on social media.

Elisha Yered, an unofficial spokesperson for the extremist group Hilltop Youth, wrote: “This is what redemption looks like! This is a relatively large outpost that contained about 150 people from the enemy population, but it was broken.”

Yered is subject to sanctions from the UK and the EU, which said he was “part of a group of armed settlers” involved in an attack in 2023 that led to the death of a 19-year-old Palestinian, Qusai Jammal Mi’tan.

Two other settlers under UK sanctions, Neria Ben Pazi and Zohar Sabah, spent time at the illegal outpost this week, and Ben Pazi also worked on building a fence around Palestinian land.

Other Bedouin came to help villagers pack up and leave, including some who understood their fear and pain intimately because violent Israeli settlers had also driven them off the land.

The tactics used by the settlers this week were not new. The nearby hills are dotted with the ruins of abandoned villages, at least one, Wadi as-Seeq, also targeted by the UK-sanctioned Ben Pazi.

Settlers had never before built an outpost so close to Palestinian homes and the speed and intensity of the campaign in Mughayyir al-Deir was a sign of their growing confidence, activists said.

Police patrolled through the village on Friday and Israeli soldiers stood nearby. None intervened, although a “stop work” order had been issued for the illegal outpost after it was thrown up, and several settlers who spent time at it were also known to Israeli authorities for extreme violence.

A previous Israeli commander for the central region, Maj Gen Yehuda Fuchs, tried in 2023 to bar Ben Pazi from the West Bank over violent attacks on Palestinians.

The only other official Israeli visitor during the week was a far-right member of the Knesset, Zvi Sukkot, who came to back the settlers. Last week, Sukkot said in a TV debate that Israel “can kill 100 Gazans in one night during a war and nobody in the world cares”.

One Palestinian family filed a petition with Israel’s supreme court on Thursday demanding an injunction and urgent hearing into why the military, police and local authorities did not act to prevent the forced evictions and protect Palestinians.

A spokesperson for the Israeli military said troops operated “to ensure the security of the state of Israel and Judea and Samaria [Israel’s name for the occupied West Bank]”, and the government directs how the military should enforce orders about illegal construction.

The military would respond to the legal petition in court, the spokesperson said. A hearing is scheduled for next week, although by the time judges hear it the village will be empty.

For many of the families forced out, their move on Friday was a second displacement at the hands of Israelis, as their parents and grandparents had been forced from land near the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva when the state was formed in 1948.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/23/israeli-settlers-force-palestinians-leave-west-bank-village,World

Summary Taliban in talks with Russia, China on banking transactions

Currently trades around $300 million annually with Russia

Aid cuts, sanctions mean less USD entering Afghanistan

KABUL, May 23 (Reuters) - The Taliban administration is in advanced talks with Russia for banks from both sanctions-hit economies to settle trade transactions worth hundreds of millions of dollars in their local currencies, Afghanistan's acting commerce minister said.

The Afghan government has made similar proposals to China, the minister, Haji Nooruddin Azizi, told Reuters on Thursday. Some discussions have been held with the Chinese embassy in Kabul, he said.

Sign up here.

The proposal with Russia, Azizi said, was being worked on by technical teams from the two countries. The move comes as Moscow focuses on using national currencies to shift reliance away from the dollar and as Afghanistan faces a stark drop in the U.S. currency entering the country due to aid cuts.

""We are currently engaged in specialised discussions on this matter, considering the regional and global economic perspectives, sanctions, and the challenges Afghanistan is currently facing, as well as those Russia is dealing with. Technical discussions are underway,"" Azizi said in an interview at his office in Kabul.

The Chinese foreign ministry and the Russian central bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Azizi added that annual bilateral trade between Russia and Afghanistan was currently around $300 million and that was likely to grow substantially as the two sides boost investment. His administration expected Afghanistan to buy more petroleum products and plastics from Russia, he said.

""I am confident that this is a very good option...we can use this option for benefit and interests of our people and our country,' Azizi said.

""We want to take steps in this area with China as well,"" he said, adding Afghanistan had around $1 billion in trade with China each year. ""A working team composed of members from the (Afghan) Ministry of Commerce and the Chinese embassy which is an authorized body representing China in economic programmes has been formed, and talks are ongoing.""

Afghanistan's financial sector has been largely cut off from the global banking system due to sanctions placed on some leaders of the ruling Taliban, which took over the country in 2021 as foreign forces withdrew.

Rivalry with China and fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine have put the dollar's status as the world's dominant currency under fresh scrutiny in recent years.

In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin questioned the need to hold state reserves in foreign currencies since they could easily be confiscated for political reasons, saying that domestic investment of such reserves was more attractive.

The dollar has had a lock on commodity trading, allowing Washington to hinder market access for producer nations from Russia to Venezuela and Iran.

Afghanistan since 2022 has imported gas, oil and wheat from Russia, the first major economic deal after the Taliban returned to power facing international isolation following 20 years of war against U.S.-led forces.

Billions of dollars in cuts to aid to Afghanistan, accelerated this year by the United States, have meant far fewer dollars, which are flown in cash for humanitarian operations, are entering the country.

Development agencies and economists say the Afghani currency has so far remained relatively stable but may face challenges in future.

Azizi said that the stability of the currency and his administration's efforts to boost international investment including with the Afghan diaspora, would prevent a shortage of U.S. dollars in the country.

Trump Seeks Extensive Student Data in Pressure Campaign to Control Harvard,"The latest confrontation between Harvard University and the Trump administration began last month with a far-reaching demand for data on international students.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, sent a letter to Harvard requesting, among other things, coursework for every international student and information on any student visa holder involved in misconduct or illegal activity.

Harvard rebuffed parts of the request, and the Trump administration retaliated on Thursday. In one of its most aggressive moves so far against the university, the government said Harvard could no longer enroll any international students, who account for about one-fourth of enrollment.

Ms. Noem also expanded her request for records to include any videos of international students, on campus or off, involved in protests or illegal or dangerous activity.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/trump-harvard-international-student-records.html,World
Russian Su-57 “Fizzles Out” In Malaysia; State Media Claims 5th-Gen Felons Have Got Its 1st Customer,"Russia is aggressively promoting the Su-57E, the export variant of the fifth-generation Su-57 stealth aircraft. However, the alleged lack of interest in this aircraft, even by operators of other Russian fighters like Malaysia and India, paints a grim picture.

Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport announced on May 19 that it will demonstrate the Su-57E fifth-generation fighter jet (the export variant of the Su-57) at the LIMA 2025 international maritime and aerospace exhibition in Malaysia. However, a new report suggests that the aircraft never made it to the exhibition.

Social media images of Russian equipment at LIMA 2025 feature only the scaled model of the aircraft at the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) stand. The Su-57E, which was slated to debut in Malaysia after China and India, was nowhere to be seen.

Russia’s state arms exporter Rosoboronexport announced on May 19 that it will demonstrate the Su-57E fifth-generation fighter jet at the LIMA 2025 international maritime and aerospace exhibition in Malaysia.

Meanwhile, Russian state media TASS, citing the press office of Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, reported that the first foreign buyer of the Russian-made Su-57E fifth-generation fighter jet’s export modification will start its operation in 2025.

“The first foreign customer of the Su-57E will start operating the aircraft in 2025,” the defense agency said. It did not name any country, but could be hinting towards Algeria.

Earlier, Algerian state media suggested that Algeria had become the aircraft’s first export customer. However, neither Russia nor the Algerian government acknowledged any such deal.

MRCA Contract

In recent times, the Su-57E has been linked to the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) program, which remains in limbo years after it was initiated. Despite operating a highly tailored variant of the Russian Su-30, this country seems uninterested in acquiring the Russian Su-57E.

And no, we are not talking about India.

Malaysia launched the MRCA (Multi-Role Combat Aircraft) program to acquire advanced fighter jets that could replace its aging fleet and help enhance Malaysia’s air power with a modern, multi-role fighter jet.

While Moscow has not expressly stated if it plans to officially pitch the Su-57E to Kuala Lumpur, the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) had earlier examined the Russian stealth fighter up close at the Chinese and Indian Air Shows. Moreover, previous reports in the local Malaysian media indicated that the RMAF was exploring the possibility of acquiring the Su-57 as part of the MRCA program.

It is pertinent to note that Malaysia wasn’t always interested in the Su-57, perhaps due to its problematic track record and the many delays associated with its development, testing, and production.

The MRCA program began around 2009 to replace the RMAF’s MiG-29s, which were nearing the end of their service life due to high maintenance costs and limited operational hours. Initial contenders included the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab Gripen, and Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

However, last year, the program evolved to focus on fifth-generation or near-fifth-generation aircraft. Two new aircraft—the Russian Su-57 and the South Korean KF-21 were added to the list of aircraft in the reckoning. In March this year, some unverified reports suggested Malaysia was inching closer to purchasing 18 fifth-generation combat jets.

However, the MRCA program continues to be in abeyance as Malaysia’s defense strategy emphasizes balancing cost, capability, and geopolitical alignment—something it has been unable to achieve.

Su-57’s planned appearance was widely interpreted as a bold signal–perhaps even a soft launch–that a deal was imminent. But with the Felons failing to turn up, that narrative has started to unravel.

The alleged absence of Su-57 from LIMA could be a bummer for both sides. The RMAF needs to urgently replace the F/A-18 Hornets that are fast approaching the end of their service life. While there was earlier some buzz about purchasing second-hand Kuwaiti Hornets, it now appears to be stalled. In addition to the Hornets, the Su-30MKM and Hawks are also ageing rapidly, necessitating an upgrade.

As far as Russia is concerned, the Su-57’s export potential has significantly diminished in the last three years owing to factors such as delivery delays and limited production capacity, making it difficult to inspire confidence among prospective customers.

Russia Pitches Su-57 To India

Russia has been pitching the Su-57 to India, even though New Delhi walked out of the Indo-Russian Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) program in 2018 due to the costs and performance of the jointly developed aircraft.

It renewed its pitch for the sale of its fifth-generation Su-57E stealth aircraft to India in February 2025, ahead of the Aero India 2025 exhibition. The aircraft also debuted at the air show and piqued visitors’ interest with its stunning aerobatic display.

Russia’s state arms exporter, Rosoboronexport, offered a “golden deal” to the Indian Air Force (IAF). Alexander Mikheev, Director General of Rosoboronexport, proposed “the all-round development of cooperation on the Su-57E project. Among our proposals is the supply of ready-made aircraft, the organization of their joint production in India, as well as assistance in the development of an Indian fifth-generation fighter.”

Later, in March, Rosoboronexport said that if India finalizes the deal, the Indian companies that manufacture Russian Su-30MKI fighter jets can soon begin producing the fifth-generation Su-57E fighter.

“In case of a positive decision by the Indian side, the production of the Russian fifth-generation Su-57E fighter jet can be started at the factories currently producing the Su-30MKI fighter within a short time.”

Russia is offering India three things: local production of Su-57E, modernization of Su-30MKI, and assistance with India’s own fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program.

Recently, the Russian media have taken a more insidious route to promote the Su-57 as a suitable aircraft for India.

After India launched air strikes deep inside Pakistan as part of Operation Sindoor earlier this month, Pakistan claimed its Chinese-origin J-10CE fighter armed with a long-range PL-15E missile shot down three Indian Rafale fighters, besides two other IAF jets.

Interestingly, the pro-Russian media started amplifying these reports even though they remain unsubstantiated nearly two weeks after a ceasefire came into effect.

Russian military experts and media have positioned the Su-57E as a superior aircraft to the Indian Rafale, in a bid to push its export.

Sputnik News, for instance, cited Military analyst Igor Korotchenko as saying: “India’s NEXT MOVE: MADE IN INDIA SU-57? Urgency: Pakistan’s Chinese J-10Cs forced India’s hand. Russia’s offer: Two-seat Su-57MKI with R-37M missiles (400km range—longest in the world). ‘Make in India’ production at HAL factories. Game-changer: Would dominate PLAAF & PAF for decades.

Some Russian social media bloggers have even suggested that India would be better off purchasing Russian Su-57 fighters as the IAF Rafales are no match for the Chinese J-10C. You can read a detailed report by the EurAsian Times on this here.

Nevertheless, it is safe to say that these narratives have had no impact on India, and the Russian Su-57 has a long road ahead.",https://www.eurasiantimes.com/russian-su-57-fizzles-out-in-malaysia/,World

"One Special Forces officer blocked 1,585 Afghans from settling in UK","Special Forces officer blocked 1,585 Afghans from UK

Ben Taggart Afghan special forces were in danger of reprisal after the Taliban seized back the country

A UK Special Forces officer personally rejected 1,585 resettlement applications from Afghans with credible links to special forces, newly released documents say. The files, disclosed by the Ministry of Defence in court on Thursday, show the unnamed UKSF officer rejected every application referred to him in the summer of 2023, in what was described as a ""sprint"". The MoD told the court that the officer may have been connected to matters under examination by the ongoing inquiry into alleged war crimes committed by the SAS. The admission comes after the BBC revealed last week that the UKSF officer – who previously served in Afghanistan - rejected applications from Afghans who may have witnessed the alleged crimes.

Afghan commandos, known as the Triples, supported the SAS and SBS for years in Afghanistan and were in danger of reprisal after the Taliban seized back the country in 2021. But thousands of UK resettlement applications containing credible evidence of service in the Triples were rejected. The rejections came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK had begun investigating allegations that British special forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present. If the Afghan commandos were in the UK, they could be called as witnesses - but the inquiry has no power to compel testimony from foreign nationals who are overseas. MoD officials raised concerns as early as October 2022 about the role of UKSF in rejecting applications with links to the Triples units, the new documents show. In a witness statement submitted to court, Natalie Moore, the head of the UK's Afghan resettlement team, wrote that she became concerned UKSF was applying a practice of ""automatic rejections"" with regard to Triples, giving rise to the ""appearance of an unpublished mass rejection policy"". BBC Panorama first revealed the existence of UKSF's veto power over applications in February 2024. Despite the BBC's reporting and concerns first being raised internally in October 2022 - and again between October 2023 and January 2024 - in March 2024 the MoD denied to Parliament that UKSF had had a veto over the former commandos' applications. In January 2024, then-Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer had warned senior cabinet ministers in writing of a ""significant conflict of interest that should be obvious to all"". The veto gave UKSF ""decision-making power over... potential witnesses to the inquiry"", Mercer said, calling the arrangement ""deeply inappropriate"". In the same letter, Mercer said that he had seen evidence that five former Triples had been killed by the Taliban after their resettlement applications were rejected. And in a meeting with Ms Moore, he highlighted a case in which an applicant was rejected having ""previously confronted UKSF leadership about EJKs [extrajudicial killings] in Afghanistan"".

Mercer told the BBC on Friday he was ""shocked and appalled"" at the revelations from the court case. ""When I raised what was happening with the most senior officers and civil servants in the UK Government, one in particular from UKSF claimed he was offended, and it was offensive to UKSF, that I had raised it. ""He was either lying to my face as a Cabinet Minister, which is serious enough, or is so deeply incompetent that he didn't know."" The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UKSF. When Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK. But more than 2,000 applications judged by resettlement caseworkers to have credible evidence were subsequently rejected by UKSF. The MoD later announced a review of more than 2,000 rejected applications after finding that the decisions were ""not robust"". Earlier this week, Armed Forces Minster Luke Pollard announced a new phase of the review to take into account up to 2,500 further cases which may have been improperly rejected. Some of the former Triples who were denied visas have since been tortured and killed by the Taliban, according to testimony from former colleagues, family members and lawyers. The documents disclosed in court on Thursday, as part of a judicial review case brought by a former member of the Triples, reveal that the government launched two investigations that examined the actions of UKSF and the allegations of a conflict of interest at the heart of the Triples rejections. A summary of one of those investigations, known as Operation X, said it ""did not obtain any evidence of hidden motives on the part of the UKSF liaison officer"" and found ""no evidence of automatic/instant/mass rejections"" of the Triples by UKSF - but provided no evidence to back up those conclusions. It instead concluded that the more than 2,000 rejections of Triples were down to ""slack and unprofessional verification processes"" by the UKSF liaison officer and ""lax procedures followed by the officer in not following up on all lines of enquiry before issuing rejections"". More than 600 of those rejections have since been overturned. BBC Panorama reported recently that the rejection of the Triples applications had been overseen by Gen Jenkins, who was head of UKSF at the time and was promoted last week to be the head of the Royal Navy. In the court documents, the MoD said that Gen Jenkins had no involvement with the applications and that he had not appointed the UKSF officer who rejected them. Tom de la Mare KC, representing the former Triple who brought the case, accused the MoD of breaching its duty of candour in the case by failing to disclose evidence of a blanket practice of rejection of the Triples applications. He further accused the MoD of providing misleading responses to requests for information. Cathryn McGahey KC, representing the MoD, told the court she did ""not seek to excuse or underplay in any way the provision of inaccurate answers"", and she apologised for the fact that the MoD had previously told the court that no veto existed. The case is examining whether the review of the rejected Triples applications was conducted in a lawful manner. Ms McGahey told the court that ""there might have been a better way of doing it, but that doesn't make it unlawful"". Daniel Carey, partner at DPG, the law firm acting on behalf of the former Triples, said: ""My client spent years asking the MoD to rectify the blanket refusals of Triples personnel and has seen many killed and harmed by the Taliban in that time. ""He is pleased that the MoD have agreed to inform everyone of the decisions in their cases and to tell the persons affected whether their cases are under review or not, but it should not have required litigation to achieve basic fairness.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev40r9yve4o,World
South Africa town leader 'sad' about Trump's misuse of white crosses video,"Summary Town representative complains the video 'is being used politically'

Crosses were tribute to murdered couple, not evidence of mass killings, she says

Police minister denies genocide claims, cites low farm murder rates

JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Reuters) - A local representative of an area shown in a video played at the White House said she was ""sad"" that U.S. President Donald Trump used the footage of hundreds of white crosses as false evidence of mass killings of white South African farmers.

Trump showed an aerial shot of a procession of cars moving along a road lined with white crosses during his meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday, as he doubled down on false claims of a white genocide in South Africa. He said the crosses were ""burial sites"" for over 1,000 white farmers.

Sign up here.

The shot, whose location and date were verified by Reuters, showed crosses that were actually placed along the road between the town of Newcastle and the rural community of Normandien in 2020 as a tribute to a farming couple who had been murdered, said Bebsie Cronje, a ward councillor for Newcastle, in KwaZulu-Natal province.

The crosses, installed to accompany a memorial service for the couple, have since been removed.

""The crosses was not a display of how many farm murders (took place) or whatever. It was just a total tribute to the Raffertys,"" she told Reuters by telephone.

""I feel it's very sad that something like this is being used politically.""

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

South Africa's police minister Senzo Mchunu also said in a press briefing on Friday that the crosses were linked to the murder of the Rafferty couple. Three suspects were arrested and sentenced for their killing and are in jail, he said.

""They were sadly murdered by criminals in their home. The incident sparked a very strong protest by the farming community. The crosses symbolised killings on farms over years, they are not graves,"" he said.

He added that claims of a ""white genocide"" in South Africa were ""unfounded and unsubstantiated"", saying the country only recorded six farm murders in the first three months of 2025, which included one white person. A total of 5,727 murders took place over that period, down from 6,536 in the same period last year, figures from the police ministry showed.

""The history of farm murders in the country has always been distorted and reported in an unbalanced way. The truth is that farm murders have always included African people in more numbers.""

Cronje said the placing of the crosses was not politically motivated.

""There was a group that was very close to the Raffertys. And they organised the gathering and the travelling of everybody there,"" said Cronje, referring to the long line of vehicles in the video.

She said that since then, another white farmer from Newcastle was murdered. But she did not feel that the crimes were linked to race.

""I can't say that it's just white people. If a black farmer is killed, it doesn't come to the news,"" said Cronje, who is from the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's second-biggest political party and a coalition partner of the African National Congress.

Can Trump's pricey 'Golden Dome' missile defence system be done?,"Can Donald Trump build the 'Golden Dome' over the US?

17 hours ago Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, White House Share Save

Getty Images Trump said the Golden Dome will be completed by the end of his term.

Warheads raining down from beyond the Earth's atmosphere. Faster-than-sound cruise missiles striking US infrastructure. Sky-high nuclear blasts. These are just some of the nightmarish scenarios that experts warn could come true if the US's dated and limited defence systems were overwhelmed in a future high-tech attack. Even a single, relatively small nuclear detonation hundreds of miles above the heads of Americans would create an electromagnetic pulse - or EMP - that would have apocalyptic results. Planes would fall out of the sky across the country. Everything from handheld electronics and medical devices to water systems would be rendered completely useless. ""We wouldn't be going back 100 years,"" said William Fortschen, an author and weapons researcher at Montreat College in North Carolina. ""We'd lose it all, and we don't know how to rebuild it. It would be the equivalent of us going back 1,000 years and having to start from scratch."" In response to these hypothetical - but experts say quite possible - threats, US President Donald Trump has set his eyes on a ""next generation"" missile shield: the Golden Dome. But while many experts agree that building such a system is necessary, its high cost and logistical complexity will make Trump's mission to bolster America's missile defences extremely challenging.

An executive order calling for the creation of what was initially termed the ""Iron Dome for America"" noted that the threat of next-generation weapons has ""become more intense and complex"" over time, a potentially ""catastrophic"" scenario for the US. Patrycja Bazylczyk, a missile defence expert at the Washington DC-headquartered Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the BBC that existing systems are geared towards intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, such as those used by North Korea. But powerful nations like Russia and China are also investing in newer technologies that could strike not just neighbours, but adversaries an ocean away. Among the threats publicly identified by US defence officials are hypersonic weapons able to move faster than the speed of sound and fractional orbital bombardment systems - also called Fobs - that could deliver warheads from space. Each - even in limited numbers - are deadly. ""The Golden Dome sort of re-orients our missile defence policy towards our great power competitors,"" Ms Bazylczyk said. ""Our adversaries are investing in long-range strike capabilities, including things that aren't your typical missiles that we've been dealing with for years.""

What will the 'Golden Dome' look like?

The White House and defence officials have so far provided few concrete details about what the Golden Dome - which is still in its conceptual stages - would actually look like. Speaking alongside Trump in the Oval Office on 20 May, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said only that the system will have multiple layers ""across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors"". Trump added that the system will be capable of intercepting missiles ""even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched in space"", with various aspects of the programme based as far afield as Florida, Indiana and Alaska. In previous testimony in Congress, the newly named overseer of the programme, Space Force General Michael Guetlein, said that the Golden Dome will build on existing systems that are largely aimed at traditional ICBMs. A new system would - add multiple layers that could also detect and defend against cruise missiles and other threats, including by intercepting them before they launch or at the various stages of their flight. Currently, the US Missile Defence Agency largely relies on 44 ground-based interceptors based in Alaska and California, designed to combat a limited missile attack. Experts have warned that the existing system is woefully inadequate if the US homeland were to be attacked by Russia and China, each of which has an expanded arsenal of hundreds of ICBMs and thousands of cruise missiles. ""[Current systems] were created for North Korea,"" said Dr Stacie Pettyjohn, a defence expert at the Center for a New American Security. ""It could never intercept a big arsenal like Russia's, or even a much smaller one like China's."" The Congressional Research Office, or CBO, has said that ""hundreds or thousands"" of space-based platforms would be necessary to ""provide even a minimal defence"" against incoming missiles - a potentially enormously expensive proposition.

Israel's Iron Dome: an example?

Trump first revealed his concept for the Golden Dome during a joint address to Congress in March, when he said that ""Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too"". The president was referring to Israel's ""Iron Dome"" system, which the country has used to intercept rockets and missiles since 2011. Israel's Iron Dome, however, is designed to intercept shorter-range threats, while two other systems - known as David's Sling and the Arrow - combat larger ballistic missiles such as those that have been fired by Iran and the Houthis in Yemen. Ms Bazylczyk described the Iron Dome as geared towards ""lower tier"" threats, such as rockets fired from Gaza or southern Lebanon. The Golden Dome would go beyond that, to detect longer range missiles as well, she said. To accomplish that, she said it will need to combine different capabilities. ""And I'll be looking out for the command and control system that can weave all of this together,"" she said, noting that such a thing does not currently exist.
