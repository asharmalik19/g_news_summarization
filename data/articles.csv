Top 10 Android phones released in 2025,"Android phones in 2025 are faster, last longer on a single charge, and come packed with smarter AI features. But beyond all the fancy features, what makes a phone great is how well it fits into your daily life.

That’s what this guide is here for: to help you pick a phone that does what you need. No tech fluff. No confusing language. Just honest, straightforward advice based on what works for everyday use.

If you’re wondering, “Which Android phones should I buy this year?” or “What features do I really need?,” you’re in the right place.

What you should look out for when choosing an Android phone

With so many Android phones out there, it’s easy to get distracted by popular names and shiny features. But what indeed makes a phone suitable? What should you be paying attention to before spending your money?

1. Display: How good does the screen look, and hold up?

The screen is the first thing you notice on a phone; you use it for everything, from texting and scrolling to watching videos and playing games. So, it needs to look sharp, respond fast, and stay clear even when you’re outside under the sun.

Here’s what you should check:

Refresh rate (Hz): This affects how smooth your screen feels when you scroll or switch apps. Most top Android phones in 2025 now come with 120Hz screens. Some even go up to 144Hz, which gamers will love for the extra quick response.

Some even go up to 144Hz, which gamers will love for the extra quick response. Brightness: Ever struggled to see your screen outside? Brightness matters. Phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and Vivo X200 Ultra hit crazy-high brightness levels, over 2,600 nits, so that you won’t squint in sunlight.

AMOLED screens: This is now common in higher-end phones. It gives you rich colours, deep blacks, and better viewing angles, perfect for watching Netflix or editing photos.

This is now common in higher-end phones. It gives you rich colours, deep blacks, and better viewing angles, perfect for watching Netflix or editing photos. Adaptive refresh rate (LTPO): This tech helps save battery. Your screen knows when to slow down (like when reading) and when to speed up (like while gaming). Less power wasted, same great visuals.

2. Camera: Are the pictures and videos worth it?

Forget the megapixel hype, excellent camera quality is about more than just numbers. What matters is how well the phone captures your moments, day or night.

Look for:

Multiple lenses: A good Android phone will have broad, ultra-wide, and zoom (telephoto) lenses. This gives you flexibility in how you take photos.

AI helps improve photos automatically. It fixes lighting, sharpens faces, improves video clarity, and even helps edit pictures in real time.

So if you post on social media, shoot videos for fun, or just want sharp memories of your life, the correct camera setup can make a big difference.

3. Battery & charging: Will the phone keep up with your day?

Nobody wants to carry a charger everywhere or panic at 10%. A phone’s battery needs to last and charge fast.

Here’s what to focus on:

Battery size: Look for 5,000mAh or more. That’s the sweet spot for all-day use.

Handy if you hate cables. Just drop your phone on the pad, and it will power up. Silicon-carbon batteries: Some 2025 android phones now use this newer tech to pack more power into slimmer bodies. More battery, less bulk, nice win.

Think about this: Do you often go hours without access to a charger? Then battery life should be high on your list.

4. Performance: Will it run smoothly, no matter what you do?

You want a phone that won’t lag, freeze, or force-close your apps, whether you’re switching between emails, editing videos, or playing games.

Focus on:

The processor (CPU): The “brain” of the phone. Android phones in 2025 now run on powerful chips like the Snapdragon 8 Elite, MediaTek Dimensity 9400, or Google Tensor G5.

AI processing (NPU): This is the part of the chip that handles innovative tasks, like voice commands, real-time translations, and faster photo editing, directly on your phone, not in the cloud. It makes everything feel quicker and more personal.

This section greatly matters if you hate slow phones or want one that keeps up with your busy life.

Go for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra or the OnePlus 13.

FTC drops case against Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard purchase,"Davide Xu is a freelance writer for ESI. With a background in finance and a deep passion for competitive gaming, he loves breaking down anything about the industry, from the latest investments to the teams' competitive performances, especially when it comes to League of Legends.

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially dropped the case that sought to block the acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard by tech giant Microsoft.

Following the lost appeal by the FTC to reverse a judge’s decision to block the deal on May 7th, 2025, the case was officially dismissed on May 22nd, 2025, as confirmed by Microsoft’s Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith.

The FTC Commission stated that the case, which saw Activision Blizzard being bought for $68.7bn (~£50.5bn), was no longer in the public interest. Therefore, it has dropped the case after more than a year.

The acquisition, first proposed at the start of 2022, drew antitrust concerns worldwide, as regulators feared Microsoft would suppress its competitors, such as Sony’s PlayStation, by gaining exclusive control over Activision’s popular game titles. This includes Call of Duty, Diablo, and World of Warcraft.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) initially also blocked the deal in April 2023 but allowed Microsoft to submit a restructured deal that was approved in September 2023, completing the merger on October 13th. The FTC attempted to block the deal in 2023 but lost the preliminary injunction. Despite appealing the decision, the court upheld the previous ruling.

Microsoft’s acquisition came at a difficult time for Activision since it struggled with esports franchises, the Overwatch League and Call of Duty League. This saw several owners start collective bargaining against the company due to high costs and missed promises on revenue. In July 2023, franchise owners voted on the future of the now-defunct Overwatch League.",https://esportsinsider.com/2025/05/ftc-drops-case-against-microsofts-activision-blizzard-purchase,Technology

This New Charger is Making Waves; TwelveSouth's PowerCord,"No more power bricks, just plug the cable in and charge your devices. This new USB-C power cable is so simple, and it’s crazy how no one ever thought about it earlier.







A new USB-C power cable concept from Twelve South, called the PowerCord, is gaining attention for its simple yet effective design. This innovative cable integrates the power adapter directly into the wall plug, effectively eliminating the need for a separate, bulky power brick.

Typically, charging devices like phones, tablets, or even laptops require both a wall plug and a separate USB-C cable. The PowerCord streamlines this process by combining them into a single unit. With a standard wall plug on one end and a USB-C connector on the other, users can simply plug it directly into an outlet and then into their device.

The PowerCord offers a 30-watt power supply, suitable for charging a wide range of small to medium-sized devices, including iPhones, Pixel phones, iPads, Galaxy Tabs, Nintendo Switches, and even MacBook Airs.







Available in 4-foot and 10-foot lengths, the cable features a durable braided design and comes in slate black or dune white. Currently, the PowerCord is available with a Type-A wall plug, making it ideal for North America (specifically the US and Canada). Twelve South has announced plans to release EU and UK versions in mid to late June. The 4-foot model is priced at $39.99, while the 10-foot version costs $49.99.",https://www.techjuice.pk/this-simple-new-charger-is-making-waves/,Technology
Use Sora AI For Free With Microsoft’s Bing Video Creator,"Microsoft is stepping into the AI video generation space by offering access to OpenAI’s powerful Sora AI model through its upcoming Bing Video Creator for free.







Bing Image Creator is already one of the user’s favorite tools for image generation. Microsoft is taking things to the next step with its Bing Video Creator, allowing users to create AI videos with Sora AI support.

Unlike OpenAI’s direct Sora access, which is typically part of paid ChatGPT plans, Microsoft’s Bing Video Creator will allow users to generate AI videos using text prompts without a subscription cost. It is currently in Beta and is being teased for desktop and through the Bing mobile app on Android and iOS.

This free access comes with some limitations, too. OpenAI’s full Sora model allows more advanced functionalities like uploading images or combining video clips. Bing Video Creator will primarily focus on generating videos from text prompts. This means users will describe their desired video scene in words, and the AI will bring it to life.







Users with Microsoft Reward points will have the option to use them for faster video generation speeds, offering a way to enhance the free experience.

By integrating Sora into Bing, Microsoft is positioning itself as a key player in the generative AI landscape. But it’s worth noting that the AI video generation market is rapidly evolving. Google’s Veo and other tools like Kling AI are also making significant advancements in this area. So, we will have to wait and see how well Microsoft’s Video Creator will perform.",https://www.techjuice.pk/use-sora-ai-for-free-with-microsofts-bing-video-creator/,Technology

Poco F7 might show up on the global stage with a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chip, 12GB or 16GB RAM, and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. The display is also set to impress, as it claims to have an HDR brightness of 3200 nits. This will be an AMOLED 6.83” screen with 1.5k resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.





The camera here is not as over-the-top as the Poco F7 Pro or Ultra, but it is serviceable, giving you a 50 MP sensor for the primary lens and an 8 MP ultrawide shooter. The selfie camera will probably be a 20 MP sensor hidden inside a punch-hole cutout.

"9 Best Fitness Trackers for Men 2025, Selected By Fitness Experts","The best fitness trackers no longer just monitor your workouts. They’re comprehensive health and fitness tools that help you tune into your body, train smarter and stay motivated. Even the cheaper fitness trackers now pack enough features to transform your training.

If you want to optimise your workouts, reduce stress, recover faster, sleep better, and avoid burnout, a fitness tracker can be a useful weapon. Armed with these little wearable labs, everyone now has access to elite level insights at the raise of a wrist or the swipe of an app. We’ve never had more information to help us fine-tune our fitness and stay on top form.



Evidence also shows the best fitness trackers can do wonders for your motivation levels and daily activity. Plus, they’ll also help you handle the daily grind, tracking stress levels and helping you spot when it’s time to get stuck in or take a step back. Heck, the smarter fitness watches like the Apple Watch even offer tools to help boost your productivity.

Given the impressive capabilities of these new-gen models from the likes of Garmin, Apple, Fitbit, Polar, Coros and more, it's no surprise the global smartwatch market is projected to hit a mega $58.1 billion by 2028.

However, choosing a tracker is now a trickier task. So to help you pick the best wearable for your training needs, our team of health and fitness experts strapped on the best fitness trackers and watches you can buy right now and put them through rigorous testing, from roads and trails to the gym floor.

More fitness tech reviews: The Best Garmin Watches | The Best Apple Watches | The Best Garmin Alternatives | Whoop 4.0 Review: Is it Worth the Cost? | Oura Ring: Our Honest Verdict

How to Choose a Fitness Tracker

With all the choice on the fitness wearables shelves, finding the tracker that suits you best can be overwhelming. It pays to be really clear about your priorities and how you plan to train. If you’re hitting the gym three times a week for HIIT classes or strength sessions, you’ll want a very different wearable to someone who’s planning big off-grid adventures.

The big brands to consider range from Garmin, Polar, COROS and Sunnto, who all tend to make devices primarily built for sport tracking first but with some smartwatch tools. Fitbit, Huawei and Amazift tend to offer more day-to-day fitness trackers while the very best smartwatches with fitness capabilities come from Apple, Samsung and Google. For continuous, detailed health tracking without a screen, look towards Whoop or Oura.

In terms of budget, you can expect to spend anything from £99 right up to £1,000+ for the most capable multisport trackers and smartwatches. But there’s a whole host of devices from £200-£500 that cover the fitness tracking needs of most.

What to Consider

Fitness trackers now serve up a vast array of fitness, health and wellbeing features. Here are some of the key tricks and tools to look out for.

AMOLED Screen

When it comes to bright, crisps, responsive touchscreens, smartwatches like the Apple Watch set the pace but fitness trackers are increasingly following. The kicker here is that you tend to trade battery life for sparkly screens but the best devices are pushing those limits too. But if you want the sharpest display, AMOLED is the way.

Dual-Frequency GPS

Dual frequency GPS lets devices receive satellite signals from multiple frequencies – in theory helping to plug gaps and weed out inaccurate reads in more challenging environments like built up urban areas. Just because a watch offers dual frequency doesn’t guarantee better accuracy but it’s a good sign you’ll log better training traces.

Heart rate (HR)

Keeping tabs on your BPM during a workout is one of the most effective ways to make sure you're getting the most from your training. The majority of fitness trackers will monitor heart rate and offer heart rate zone training, but the rate at which it's recorded (outside of workout tracking) can vary from device to device.

It's not all about your fitness or calorie burn, though. Many fitness trackers now continuously measure your resting heart rate (RHR) — the number of beats every 60 seconds at rest – as a reliable way of checking your heart health. They also used it to feed stress readouts. If heart health is a focus, it’s also worth looking for devices that offer ECG readings and irregular heart rate alerts.

Readiness, sleep, recovery and HRV insights

The rise of readiness redouts has been pretty swift. These attempt to crunch things like your sleep quantity and quality, skin temperature and your heart rate variability into one estimate that helps you understand how hard you should push that day. But be warned: once you start combining estimated metrics into singles scores, it increases the room for error. Taking a simple, same time, same protocol heart rate variability reading daily is a far more reliable way to get a window into how your body is handling the stresses of training and life.

Other smarts

When it comes to the tools for handling daily life, music, contactless payments, weather and chat/messaging, bona-fide smartwatches like the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra win this battle hands down. But we’re seeing brands like Garmin playing some catch up offering offline music, contactless payments, camera controls and even chat.

How We Test Fitness Trackers

Our team has put more than 50 fitness trackers and smartwatches to the test to find the best. We lived for weeks at a time with each watch, ran, swam, hiked, biked and worked out, testing each feature of these powerful training partners, before rating the results.

For each model, we looked at the design, comfort and durability, conducted detailed side-by-side tests of the GPS accuracy, battery life and optical heart rate performance up against a chest strap. We sized up the in- and post-workout insights and recovery recommendations, including all the features that help you make progress.",https://www.menshealth.com/uk/gym-wear/g64765826/best-fitness-trackers/,Technology

Google Unveiled New AI Content Detector Device,"Google unveiled a new tool at Google I/O, the SynthID Detector, designed to determine if content has been created with the assistance of Google’s AI tools. This includes content produced by Google’s models like Gemini, Imagen, Lyria, and Veo.







The primary goal of SynthID Detector is to provide a verification portal for quickly and efficiently identifying content that has been created using Google’s AI tools. It aims to offer essential transparency in generative media by embedding digital watermarks directly into AI-generated content. These watermarks are invisible to human perception but are detectable by SynthID’s technology.



Initially focused on AI-generated imagery, SynthID has expanded to cover various modalities, including AI-generated text, audio, and even video.

When a user uploads an image, audio track, video, or text to the SynthID Detector portal, the tool scans the media for a SynthID watermark. If a watermark is detected, the portal highlights specific portions of the content that are most likely to contain the watermark.







Google is currently rolling out the SynthID Detector to early testers and has plans for wider availability. Journalists, media professionals, and researchers can join a waitlist for access to the tool.

Additionally, Google is collaborating with industry partners to expand the use of SynthID technology. For example, they have partnered with NVIDIA to watermark videos generated by NVIDIA’s Cosmos preview. This means that SynthID watermarks can appear on content created not only by Google but also by other sources.",https://www.techjuice.pk/google-unveiled-new-ai-content-detector-device/,Technology

The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.



PROMPT:



Please write a metafictional literary short story… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

ChatGPT can directly edit your code

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.

February 2025

OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.

ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

January 2025

OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.

OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.

OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan

Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.

OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks

ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.

FAQs:

What is ChatGPT? How does it work?

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

When did ChatGPT get released?

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

What is the latest version of ChatGPT?

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

Can I use ChatGPT for free?

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Who uses ChatGPT?

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

What companies use ChatGPT?

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Can ChatGPT write essays?

Yes.

Can ChatGPT commit libel?

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Does ChatGPT have an app?

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

What is the ChatGPT character limit?

It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Does ChatGPT have an API?

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

How good is ChatGPT at writing code?

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.

Can you save a ChatGPT chat?

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Can ChatGPT be detected?

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.

Are ChatGPT chats public?

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.

What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/,Technology

Apple is working on smart glasses that could be ready within the year, according to a new report.

The glasses would feature an array of sensors that allow them to be aware of the world around them, according to Bloomberg.

The company is planning to launch the glasses in 2026, the report claims.

That would put them in direct competition with Meta’s popular glasses, developed in collaboration with Ray-Ban. Those include a camera, microphone, speakers that project into the ear and a connection that allow them to speak to Meta’s AI assistant.

The Apple glasses would presumably function similarly to Apple’s existing AirPods. They include a microphone and a camera that can be used to talk to the Siri virtual assistant.

But the glasses would include at least one camera that would allow it to see the world and presumably incorporate that context into answers.

Some rumours have suggested that Apple is also working on possible AirPods that would include a camera themselves – though it remains unclear whether those will launch, and what the camera could be used for.

Apple has already released its Vision Pro, an augmented reality headset that the owner wears like goggles. But that is heavy and uses cameras to project the outside world onto a screen on the outside.

Meta has its own such headset, as well as its glasses, and has explicitly said that it is looking to integrate the two into a lightweight headset that would show the real world but also offer the ability to overlay virtual information and objects onto it.

Apple has long said that its primary interest is in augmented rather than virtual reality, and that the aim of the Vision Pro headset is to connect users with the outside world.",https://www.the-independent.com/tech/apple-new-product-glasses-iphone-ai-meta-b2756781.html,Technology
The WIRED Travel Tech Guide to Family Vacation Harmony,"Ah, the joys of a vacation. A little time to unwind and put your feet up. Or if you have kids, a chance to get moaned at in a new time zone. The nagging kicked off before my family left the airport on our last holiday and didn’t let up.

“Dad, my internet isn’t working.” “Dad, where can I charge this?” “Dad, what’s the Wi-Fi password?” “Dad, are we there yet?”

Luckily, this year I planned ahead, and you can too with our best travel tech guide to a harmonious family vacation. Disclaimer: I'll show you how to keep everyone online and fully charged, but I can't accept responsibility for non-tech-related family arguments.

The Internet

In theory, it would be great to leave your phones and tablets behind and immerse yourself in the vacation experience to “live, laugh, love” your way around the world. In reality, travel has dull moments and downtime, and teenagers cannot be separated from the internet for long. You can save yourself a lot of trouble by ensuring that everyone can get online.

A Travel Router

My top tip is to set up a travel router before you go. Plug it into your existing router and then connect all the devices you are taking on vacation, but most importantly, you, your partner, and your kids’ phones. Now, when you arrive at your apartment or hotel, you can plug in, connect the travel router to public Wi-Fi, or even connect your phone to the router and use it as a hot spot, so everyone is securely connected without needing any login details. Here’s the one I recommend in our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide.

Connecting Smartphones

You should check your roaming options based on where you are going, but it’s a safe bet that roaming charges will be a hefty unwelcome extra expense when you get home, especially if you allow your kids to connect to foreign networks. You have a few options to avoid this issue.

Use your phone as a hot spot : I have certain roaming travel allowances on my phone contract that my wife and kids don't have, so it made sense to use my phone as a hot spot for them to connect to when we were out and about. Check your contract before you do this, but even if you don’t have specific benefits, you’ll find it cheaper to get data for one device than more. Here’s how to use your phone as a hot spot. It will drain your battery faster, but I have a tip for that below in the charging section. Remember to turn off cell service or mobile data on the rest of your family’s phones.

Buy a Travel SIM or eSIM : You can snag international SIM cards to switch into your phone when you land abroad. This can be a cost-effective way to make sure you have plenty of data and can connect to foreign networks, although it does mean using a different number for the duration of your stay. We have a guide on how to use an eSIM for international travel.

We have a guide on how to use an eSIM for international travel. Buy a hot spot: Instead of using your phone as a hot spot, you could always snag a purpose-built one for everyone to connect to. These portable devices need a SIM or eSIM and enable you to connect multiple gadgets via Wi-Fi. Some portable hot spots even come with service included. I recently tested the excellent but pricey Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro ($800) and the cheaper but inferior Acer Connect Enduro M3 5G ($356).

Download Ahead of Time

To prepare for the journey, you should download maps in advance and plot your routes. If you use Google Maps, you can tap your profile icon at the top right (bottom right if you use Apple Maps) and choose Offline maps to get started. Downloading a map of the area you are visiting is a good way to save data and serves as a backup in case there are connection issues when you arrive.

Courtesy of Simon Hill Courtesy of Simon Hill

If you’re looking for directions in Google Maps, say for public transport from the airport to the hotel, remember you can tap the Leave drop-down box (Now in Apple Maps) and select a day and time to get the correct directions for your arrival.

It’s also a great idea to ensure you and your kids have some entertainment on your phones before you go. Pick a few movies or episodes of a favorite show and download them the night before. Here’s how to download videos to watch offline. Some of the best mobile games can also be played offline (I recommend Mini Metro).

Entertainment

Speaking of entertainment, you should take some with you. At the end of a busy day sightseeing or roller coaster riding, you might want to unwind with an hour of TV, and the novelty of Spanish soap operas or French debate shows will wear off quickly if you don't speak the language. I always pack our Chromecast, but any of the picks in our Best Streaming Devices guide will do. This Roku stick is our favorite and plugs easily into any available HDMI port.

Just make sure that you are logged into all your streaming services and that you connect them to your travel router before you go. That way, you have all your favorite shows and the correct next episode lined up. If you get blocked by those annoying login screens for hotel Wi-Fi, you can always connect to Wi-Fi on your phone and log in, then use it as a hot spot for your streaming stick to connect to.

Travel Charging

It's crucial to pack charging gear when you travel. You’ll want travel adapters, charging cables, and power banks. Make sure you have the right adapters for the country you are visiting, make sure you have a charging cable for every device you are taking, and test them all out before you leave home. Don’t forget about your smartwatch, fitness tracker, or smart ring. I also recommend taking at least one spare travel charger just in case. I run through various options in my Best Travel Adapters guide, but the top pick is ideal for family trips.

The top pick in our Best USB-C Cables guide will charge any device with a USB-C port, but this Nomad cable is a handy option for folks with an Apple Watch.

Photograph: Simon Hill Nomad Universal Cable for Apple Watch $99 Nomad

You can also find several options for different devices in our Best Portable Chargers guide, but this is the one I recommend for travel.

Security

One of our favorite password managers, 1Password, features Travel Mode, enabling you to delete any sensitive data from devices before you travel and restore it with a click after you’ve crossed a border. This prevents anyone, including law enforcement at international borders, from accessing your complete password vault. You may also be interested in how to protect yourself from phone searches at the US border.

If you are staying at campsites or rented accommodations and have concerns about anyone rummaging through your stuff, or you feel there’s a risk of theft, it might be worth packing a portable security camera. For Airbnbs and places with Wi-Fi, try a camera from our Best Indoor Security Cameras guide. Our top pick is compact and affordable.

If you need something that can go outdoors or connect to a mobile network because there’s no Wi-Fi, I recommend this Arlo camera in my Best Outdoor Security Cameras guide. But it is expensive and requires a cell service plan when Wi-Fi isn’t available.

Bonus Travel Tips

Here are a few bonus tips that might help your family trip go a little more smoothly. Bon voyage!

While it’s always a good idea to carry a little cash just in case you run into a store or service that doesn’t accept cards, you can also get plastic that’s widely accepted and enables you to change money with a couple of taps. I love the Wise card and use it on all my trips because it offers instant electronic currency exchange in the app with decent rates for many major currencies. You also get a contactless Visa debit card you can use on your travels. Remember, it’s usually best (cheaper) to pay in the local currency whenever you get a choice.

Photos and videos can help you preserve the highlights of your vacation to bore your extended family and friends with, but they’re also nice to have and look back on in future years. The best camera is the one you have with you, so probably your phone, but if you want to up your game, consider our Best Compact Cameras, Best 360 Cameras, and Best Action Cameras guides.

We always travel light because it means no waiting for bags at the airport and makes it much easier to hop on and off buses and trains. Check out our Best Carry-On Luggage guide for recommendations, but always check the airline's rules for bag size before you go. On our last trip, I used the Ekster TravelPack Vacuum Kit ($129) to compress my clothes and squeeze more in. If you’re staying at an Airbnb or rented apartment, you can always wash clothes, so you don’t need to pack as much.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-travel-tech-for-families/,Technology
Samsung Galaxy A25 and Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) get One UI 7 update with Android 15,"It took Samsung a very long time to finally start rolling out One UI 7 based on Android 15 to its devices, but now that it's finally got going, there's seemingly no stopping it. Today two new devices have started to receive the update - the Galaxy A25 and the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024).

For the A25, it's a 3.5GB download and once you install it you'll be on software version A256NKSU5CYE2. But, we have to mention - this is currently only rolling out in Korea. Based on what's happened for other devices, it will take Samsung around a week or two to make this a truly global rollout for this device. The update includes the May 1, 2025 security patch level, which is the current one and newer than what we've seen for other handsets, so that's a good sign.

Turning our attention now towards the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024), it's a similar story - the One UI 7 update is currently only available in Korea, with the P620XXU5BYE5 firmware version, that brings with it the May 1, 2025 security patch level. In this case, you're looking at a 3GB download, so, like with the A25, it's best to grab it on a good enough network.

If you're impatient and own one of these devices and want to manually check for the update, you can always do so by going to Settings > Software update > Download and install.

Nvidia taps Intel's Xeon 6 CPUs for DGX B300 boxes,"Computex When Nvidia first teased its Arm-based Grace CPU back in 2021, many saw it as a threat to Intel and AMD. Four years later, the Arm-based silicon is at the heart of the GPU giant's most powerful AI systems, but it has not yet replaced x86 entirely.

At Computex on Thursday, Intel revealed three new Xeon 6 processors, including one that will serve as the host CPU in Nvidia's DGX B300 platform announced at GTC back in March.

According to Intel, each B300 system will feature a pair of its 64-core Xeon 6776P processors, which will be responsible for feeding the platform's 16 Blackwell Ultra GPUs with numbers to crunch. (In case you missed it, Nvidia is counting GPU dies as individual accelerators now.)

However, the chips announced Thursday aren't your typical Xeons. Unlike the rest of the Xeon 6 lineup, these ones were optimized specifically to babysit GPUs.

While most people largely associate generative AI with power-hungry graphics cards, there is still plenty of work for the CPU to do. Things like key-value caches — the model's short term memory — often need to be shuttled from system memory to HBM as AI sessions are fired up and time out, while workloads, such as vector databases used in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, are commonly run on CPU cores.

The Xeon 6776P is one of three CPUs equipped with Intel's priority core turbo (PCT) and speed select technology turbo frequency (SST-TF) tech.

The idea behind these technologies is that by limiting most of the cores to their base frequencies, the remaining cores can boost higher more consistently even when the chip is fully loaded up.

Milan Mehta, a senior product planner for Intel's Xeon division, told El Reg that the tech will enable up to eight cores per socket to run at 4.6GHz — 700MHz beyond the chip's max rated turbo — while the remaining 48 cores are pinned at their base frequency of 2.3GHz.

If this sounds familiar, Intel has employed a similar strategy on its desktop chips going back to Alder Lake, which offloaded background tasks to the chips' dedicated efficiency cores, freeing up its performance cores for higher priority workloads.

But because Intel's 6700P-series chips don't have e-cores, the functionality has to be achieved through clock pinning.

""We found that having this mix of some cores high, some cores low, helps with driving data to the GPUs,"" Mehta said. ""It's not going to make a 3x difference, but it's going to improve overall GPU utilization and overall AI inference and training performance.""

While the CPUs have been optimized for AI host duty this generation, the B300 itself follows a fairly standard DGX config. Each CPU is connected to four dual-GPU Blackwell Ultra SXM modules via an equal number ConnectX-8 NICs in a sort of daisy chain arrangement.

If you're curious, here's a full rundown of the new Xeons announced this week:

SKU Sockets Cores TDP Base Clock All Core Turbo Max Turbo PCT - 8C Turbo Cache Mem Channels Memory PCIe Lanes 6962P 2S 72 500W 2.7 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.4 GHz 432MB 12 DDR5-6400 / MCRDIMM 8800 96 6776P 2S 64 350W 2.3 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.6 GHz 336MB 8 DDR5-6400 / MCRDIMM 8000 88 6774P 1S 64 350W 2.5 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.6 GHz 336MB 8 DDR5-6400 / MCRDIMM 8000 136

Nvidia's decision to tap Intel for its next-gen DGX boxen isn't all that surprising. Chipzilla's fourth and fifth-gen Xeons were used in Nvidia's DGX H100, H200, and B200 platforms. The last time Nvidia tapped AMD for its DGX systems was in 2020, when the A100 made its debut.

Nvdia isn't the only one with an affinity for Intel's CPUs, at least when it comes to AI. When AMD debuted its competitor to the H100 in late 2023, the House of Zen wasn't above strapping the chips to an Intel part if it meant beating Nvidia.

Nvidia is also sticking with x86 for its newly launched RTX Pro Servers, but since this is more of a reference design than a first party DGX offering, it'll be up to Lenovo, HPE, Dell, and others to decide whose CPUs they'd like to pair with the system's eight RTX Pro 6000 Server GPUs.

Meanwhile, back in Arm-land

With the introduction of NVLink Fusion this week, Nvidia will soon extend support to even more CPU platforms, including upcoming Arm-based server chips from Qualcomm and Fujitsu.

As we discussed last week, the tech will enable third-party CPU vendors to use the GPU giant's speedy 1.8 TBps NVLink interconnect fabric to communicate with Nvidia graphics directly. In a more surprising move, Nvidia will also support tying third-party AI accelerators to its own Grace CPUs.

Even as Nvidia opens the door to new CPU platforms, the chip biz continues to invest in its own, homegrown Arm-based silicon.

At GTC in March, Nvidia offered the best look yet at its upcoming Vera CPU platform. Named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, the CPU is set to replace Grace next year.

The chip will feature 88 ""custom Arm cores"" with simultaneous multithreading pushing thread count to 176 per socket along with Nvidia's latest 1.8 TBps NVLink-C2C interconnect.

Despite the chip's higher core count, its 50W TDP suggests those cores may be stripped down to the bare minimum necessary to keep the GPUs humming along. While that might sound like a strange idea, many of these AI systems may as well be appliances that you interact with via an API.

Vera is set to debut alongside Nvidia's 288 GB Rubin GPUs next year. ®",https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/23/nvidia_intel_dgx/,Technology
Totvs’ second attempt to buy Linx could shake up Brazil’s IT sector – podcast,"While sentiment among Brazilian dealmakers has generally reflected the cautious mood globally, one large information technology (IT) deal could drive more M&A activity in the country.

Totvs, one of Brazil’s biggest IT companies, is making a second attempt to purchase Linx, a retail management software provider, after the vendor, Stone, reportedly dropped its asking price.

Should the deal go through, it would create a business that could face some regulatory action from the Brazilian authorities.

Additionally, due to the size of the deal, other players in Brazil’s management software and financial payments sectors may start prepping their own deals to keep up with a larger competitor.

Thiago Barrozo, Mergermarket’s Latin America editor, joins Dealcast host Julie-Anna Needham to discuss the outlook for Brazilian deals hinging off Totvs/Linx including:

Which other companies made bids for Linx?

Why did Stone cut its price expectations?

What happened the first time Totvs tried to buy the target in 2020?

All this and more in this week’s Dealcast.

Harvard Engineers Develop Super-Resistant Natural Rubber for Enhanced Durability,"Materials scientists at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a method for creating natural rubber that significantly increases its resistance to cracking even after numerous cycles of use while maintaining its essential qualities of stretchiness and durability, according to a study published in Nature Sustainability.

In the new rubber tanglemer, a long polymer strand at a crack tip de-concentrates stress over a long distance, making the material more resistant to crack growth than regular natural rubber. Image Credit: Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences

Humans have been using natural rubber, one of the most widely produced biomaterials worldwide, for thousands of years. However, until now, its resistance to crack formation has not improved much in decades.

The study was led by Zhigang Suo, Allen E. and Marilyn M. Puckett Professor of Mechanics and Materials at SEAS.

Improving crack resistance will extend the material’s service lifetime and therefore improve its sustainability. Guodong Nian, Study First Author and Postdoctoral Researcher, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences

Natural rubber is a long-lasting polymer found in many products, including gloves, tires, shoes, medical devices, and conveyor belts.

Rubber is extracted from natural rubber latex, a milk-like fluid found in the Hevea tree. It is then coagulated, dried, blended with additives, shaped, and heated to initiate vulcanization. This method results in short polymer chains within the material that are highly crosslinked, or chemically bonded.

The researchers adjusted this long-standing, high-intensity technique to produce a gentler transformation that keeps long polymer chains in their natural condition rather than chopping them into shorter ones. Their so-called rubber “tanglemer,” which resembles tangled spaghetti, increases the new product's durability by replacing crosslinks with entanglements.

Nian added, “We used a low-intensity processing method, based on latex processing methods, that preserved the long polymer chains.”

When a crack emerges in the new material, the long spaghetti strands distribute the stress by sliding past each other. This allows more rubber to crystallize as it stretches and makes the material stronger and more resistant to breaking.

Zheqi Chen, a former SEAS postdoctoral researcher and study co-first author, stated that their findings exceeded their expectations. During repeated stretching, the rubber improved its ability to resist gradual crack formation by fourfold and became ten times harder overall.

We imagined that the properties would be enhanced maybe twice or three times, but actually they were enhanced by one order of magnitude. Zheqi Chen, Former Postdoctoral Researcher, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences

The study emphasizes the importance of keeping the natural condition of long polymer chains. However, difficulties remain: the new material processing requires substantial water evaporation, resulting in a lower volume of material than would be acceptable for items such as tires.

It is best suited for thin rubber products such as gloves or condoms. Other possibilities opened up by the new method include flexible electronics and soft robotics parts.

Xianyang Bao (first author), Matthew Wei Ming Tan, and Yakov Kutsovsky co-authored the study. The National Science Foundation's Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (DMR-2011754) and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research’s award No. GA9550-20-1-0397 provided financial support for the study.

On day two of I/O, Google made a range of announcements that use Gemini AI to bring much-needed improvements to its smart home platform.

The updates aren’t just about jazzing up Google Home’s own features, this is about opening up new possibilities for any third-party apps that tap into the Google Home ecosystem. It’s a clear signal of where they’re heading.

“We’re moving beyond simple device control to create effortless smart homes that truly understand, adapt, and respond to your users’ needs,” proclaims Google.

So, where will we see this in action first? Smart security and cameras are getting a big boost. Google is essentially opening up “all the Nest camera experiences” to the Home APIs. This means developers can build in all the standard stuff we expect including having a natter via two-way talk, peeking at livestreams, and fiddling with camera settings. This even includes all those clever Gemini-powered Nest camera features.

What does that mean for you? A much smarter, more intuitive way to keep an eye on things. Rather than endlessly scrolling through footage, you could simply ask your Google Home, “Hey Google, show me when the cat knocked that vase off the shelf yesterday.”

Or imagine that you’re out of the house and you get a ping. Instead of just a “motion detected,” message, Gemini might tell you “Looks like the postie is at the door with a parcel.”

Gemini will also be cooking up AI descriptions in Google Home of what your camera sees. Your camera feed might not just show a clip, but Gemini could summarise it as “Small dog chased a squirrel across the lawn at 2:15 pm” and then use this to send out more intelligent alerts. Your camera might soon be smart enough to tell the difference between the Amazon delivery driver and your mate or neighbour popping round.

It’s not just cameras, though. Gemini’s smarts are also coming to sort out our home automations. Google’s clearly heard our collective groans about setting up complex routines, because they’re aiming to make it much easier with a few new tricks for the Automations API.

There’s ‘Suggested Automations,’ where Gemini will chip in with ideas based on how you use your kit. It’s a bit like Google Home is quietly observing and then helpfully suggests, “I’ve noticed you always turn down the thermostat and switch off the living room lights around 11 pm. Fancy making that an automatic ‘Bedtime’ routine?”.

Then there’s ‘Help me create,’ a sort of AI-powered assistant to walk you through building routines. Think of it like having a friendly tech expert on hand. You might say, “Right Google, I want something to happen when I get home from work.” Gemini could then pipe up with, “Okay, Ryan! When you get home, shall we turn on the hall lights, pop the kettle on, and maybe put on some smooth jazz?”

Google says it’s launching an early access programme for developers to get started with these Gemini-powered Home APIs later in the year.

And if that wasn’t enough, there’s also a brand-new Google Home widget on the way powered by Gemini AI. It’s called the ‘Home Summary Widget,’ and the idea is to give you a good snapshot of what’s happening at home without you having to dive into the Google Home app every time.

The clever bit is that it’ll be dynamic, changing what it shows you based on what’s relevant, probably pegged to the time of day. So, you glance at your phone mid-morning. The widget might show whether you remembered to lock the front door without opening a thing. Come evening, as you’re winding down, a quick peek at the widget could show your bedroom temperature.

Google Home is finally getting serious about being truly smart, and not just a collection of connected gadgets. The aim seems to be less “programming your house” and more “having a chat with your house” about what you want it to do.

"To avoid thermal runaway, some battery cells are now being submerged in fluid","Two battery manufacturers spoke with Tech Brew about the technology and how it expands battery use cases.

Batteries are the clean tech of all trades: They can help the electrical grid function, provide emergency power, and store renewable energy. But they have a flammability problem—and, depending on the scale, battery fires can be fatal.

Now, some manufacturers are creating batteries that can’t catch on fire because they’re surrounded by fluid.

One such battery comes from EticaAG, which manufactures lithium iron phosphate and nickel manganese cobalt batteries submerged in dielectric fluid, an electric-resistant liquid. The fluid prevents cells from catching on fire, so the “thermal spike” in the battery is contained, EticaAG President Matthew Ward told Tech Brew.

“If a cell has a thermal event, [it] doesn’t go to flame, and that thermal spike is just kept right there at the cell,” Ward said. “That one cell now has gone bad. But instead of cascading and the heat causing another cell to go off—and another and another—that doesn’t happen.”

EticaAG’s proprietary “special mix” of dielectric fluid is the result of “years and years of research,” Ward said. According to the company, it’s non-conductive, non-toxic, non-corrosive, and non-volatile.

XL Batteries also manufactures batteries that contain fluid, specifically pH neutral salt water. The company produces flow batteries, a type of rechargeable battery in which the molecules that store energy are dissolved in vanadium. XL Batteries replaces the vanadium and sulfuric acid in traditional flow batteries with pH neutral salt water, which prevents battery cells from igniting.

“It’s a literal water-based electrical solution,” XL Batteries CEO and co-founder Tom Sisto told Tech Brew. “[The batteries] could not catch on fire even if you tried.”

Sisto said non-flammability has become a “key differentiator” in batteries, especially in cases where AI chips are involved, like data centers.

“People just can’t tolerate the risk,” Sisto said. “These are $10 billion buildings full of irreplaceable Nvidia chips. Even if insurance wrote you a $10 billion check to replace the building if it caught on fire and burned down, you couldn’t get the chips even if you wanted to.”

And Prometheus Hyperscale, a data center developer, seems to agree: It just signed a multi-year agreement with XL Batteries to deploy the pH neutral salt water flow batteries at its data centers.

“We need batteries that offer performance at or above lithium,” Prometheus Hyperscale CEO Trenton Thornock said in a statement, “without the risk of overheating to deploy at our data halls.”",https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/05/23/battery-cells-submerged-in-fluid,Technology
Smartphone Monitoring Cuts BP Post-ED Discharge,"TOPLINE:

In a study, patients who received a team-based intervention involving education and mobile health support in the emergency department (ED) had greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 6 months than those who received standard discharge care.

METHODOLOGY:

A randomized clinical trial enrolled 574 adult patients (mean age, 51.1 years) with elevated BP (between 140/90 mm Hg and 180/110 mm Hg) who visited an urban academic ED between February 2019 and March 2023.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either standard discharge instructions and a primary care referral (n = 285) or a multicomponent education and empowerment intervention (E2; n = 289), which included a brief consultation with a clinical pharmacist and a smartphone-connected BP monitor with behavior change text reminders.

The primary outcome was a mean change in SBP at 6 months.

Secondary outcomes included changes in SBP at 3 months and changes in diastolic BP (DBP) at both 3 and 6 months.

TAKEAWAY:

At 6 months, patients who received the E2 intervention had a greater reduction in SBP than those who received usual care (mean difference, 4.9 mm Hg; P = .02).

The between-group differences in SBP at 3 months (4.2 mm Hg) and DBP at 6 months (2.3 mm Hg) were not statistically significant.

At 6 months, 42.9% of participants in the E2 group and 36.9% in the usual care group achieved BP levels ≤ 140/90 mm Hg, but this difference was not significant (P = .22).

IN PRACTICE:

""Results of the TOUCHED randomized clinical trial suggest that a multicomponent Education and Empowerment (E2) intervention initiated in the ED may present a viable and effective strategy for reducing SBP in patients with elevated BP who are discharged from the ED,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

The study was led by Heather Prendergast, MD, MPH, MS, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Illinois Chicago. It was published online on April 23, 2025, in JAMA Cardiology.

LIMITATIONS:

Recruitment and follow-up occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have reduced participation and introduced selection bias. The single-center design limited generalizability. Long-term cardiovascular outcomes were not assessed.

SteamOS 3.7 brings Valve’s gaming OS to other handhelds and generic AMD PCs,"Valve is releasing version 3.7 of SteamOS to the general public, and among the routine updates and changes is a big one: This is the SteamOS release that finally adds official support for some kinds of PC hardware other than Valve's own Steam Deck.

Valve mentions certain specific handhelds as having either ""official"" or ""improved support,"" including the Asus ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, and the Lenovo Legion Go S. It also includes directions for configuring the original Legion Go and ROG Ally for SteamOS installation. But Valve says that only the Steam Deck and Legion Go S have fully baked SteamOS support.

The release claims to run on ""other AMD powered handhelds"" more broadly, implying that most third-party handheld PCs with Ryzen Z1 or Z2-series processors ought to support at least some basic functionality. Other all-AMD desktops and laptops have a decent shot at being supported, too.

It was previously possible to get a SteamOS-like experience on third-party hardware using a community-maintained distribution like Bazzite, but at least some hardware will now be able to get SteamOS right from the source. This update comes just a couple of weeks after Valve announced a new ""SteamOS Compatible"" label for games that would be displayed separately from Steam Deck compatibility information.

AMD-only, for now

If you want there to be a chance that your desktop or laptop will work with SteamOS, it will have to be all-AMD on the inside. Credit: Andrew Cunningham

To try SteamOS on your hardware, Valve's two hard-and-fast requirements are ""AMD hardware"" and an NVMe SSD. The hardware requirement likely refers to, collectively, the CPU, GPU, and chipset, and possibly also the RZ-series Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules that are often paired with AMD systems. You'll also need to disable Secure Boot on your PC. This is normally enabled by default since it's an installation requirement for Windows 11, so you'll want to refer to your manufacturer's documentation to figure out how to turn it off.",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/,Technology
Case study: using technology to eliminate spreadsheets and improve risk processes,"Engineering firm Aveng Group was struggling with its enterprise risk and opportunity management, as Excel spreadsheets were leading to inefficiencies, errors and poor data visibility. Jack McCardel explains how they used Power Platform to make the process more streamlined and insightful.

Our traditional method of managing enterprise risks through Excel was cumbersome and prone to errors. It required extensive manual data entry, which o en resulted in inconsistencies and delays.

The lack of integration with other systems also meant that our risk data was siloed, making it difficult to get a comprehensive view of group risks. This fragmented approach hindered our ability to respond swiftly to emerging risks.

THE DESIGN PROCESS

In order to remedy this situation, weekly workshops were run by the Power Platform and IT project management teams with key stakeholders from across the business, gathering insights and feedback that would inform the solution design.

This collaborative approach not only enhanced their technical skills but also fostered a sense of ownership among stakeholders, who became active participants in the development process.

By leveraging Power Platform, we created an integrated enterprise risk and opportunity management app that streamlined our processes. This app automated data entry, provided real-time updates and o ered a centralised platform for risk-related information.

The intuitive interface made it easy for our team to adopt and use the app effectively. Power BI reports were developed, enabling us to gain deeper insights into our risk landscape.

THE IMPACT

The implementation of the Power Platform solution brought immediate benefits. The real-time data visibility allowed us to make informed decisions quickly, improving our overall risk and opportunity management strategy.

The centralised platform provides greater transparency for senior management, ensuring that everyone has access to the latest risk information. Additionally, the ability to generate automated notifications helped treatment owners to stay proactive in managing their risk actions.

The transition from Excel to Power Platform has been a major improvement for Aveng Group. It has not only enhanced our risk and opportunity management processes but also demonstrated the power of digital transformation in driving e iciency and accuracy.

This case study with Aveng Group highlights the importance of adopting innovative solutions to overcome traditional challenges and achieve operational excellence. By embracing Microso Power Platform, we have positioned ourselves to better manage risks and opportunities.

Liverpool fan's tickets cancelled over accusation of touting,"Liverpool fan's tickets cancelled over accusation of touting

3 hours ago Share Save Stephen Nolan and Ross Carson BBC News NI Share Save

PA Media Liverpool will lift the premiership trophy this weekend

A lifelong Liverpool fan accused of facilitating ticket touting has blasted the football club for cancelling his tickets and saying it would not refund him £1,500. Declan, from Northern Ireland, had bought three tickets for himself and his daughters, for Sunday's end of season game when Liverpool will lift the Premier League trophy. He later received an email stating: ""Your tickets have been cancelled due to suspicious activity and you will not be provided with a refund."" LFC said it takes a ""zero tolerance approach to all forms of ticket touting"" and ""anyone who facilitated ticket touting"" or ""breached the club's terms and conditions"" would be sanctioned.

A BBC Nolan Show investigation found that cancellation emails, like the one sent to Declan, are routinely sent out before fans who are under suspicion have an opportunity to defend themselves. After receiving the correspondence Declan contacted the club. ""I automatically panicked, thinking what's going on? ""Have I been hacked?"" He was told the club had discovered that in 2024 he had sold a ticket which ended up in the hands of a ticket tout. Declan had advertised a ticket on X and this was a breach of the official LFC terms and conditions. He then transferred the ticket via Liverpool's official website to a registered member. It later emerged that the account was linked to a ticket tout which neither Liverpool or Declan were aware of at the time.

""I passed on the ticket to an official member. What has happened subsequently to that I have no idea. ""But again, I can't be held accountable, surely, for something that happened 15 months ago? ""I have been to games since."" Declan has acknowledged that advertising on social media is a breach of LFC terms and conditions. But, at the time, he said he thought he was selling a ticket to a genuine fan and said he did so at less than face value. ""The ticket cost me £32, I sent it to an official member for £30. If I am a ticket tout I am the worst ticket tout in history,"" he added.

Microsoft CPO says she 'fundamentally' disagrees with the idea that people shouldn't study computer science,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Microsoft's CPO Aparna Chennapragada doesn't buy the idea that coding is on its way out.

""A lot of folks think about, 'Oh, don't bother studying computer science or the coding is dead,' and I just fundamentally disagree,"" Chennapragada, the tech giant's chief product officer of experiences and devices, said on ""Lenny's Podcast.""

""If anything, I think we've always had higher and higher layers of abstraction in programming,"" she added.

Despite fears that AI could ultimately render software engineers irrelevant — or at least materially cut down on job openings in the field — Chennapragada believes that AI only adds a further layer of abstraction in the existing process of programming.

""We don't program in assembly anymore,"" she said. ""Most of us don't even program in C, and then you're kind of higher and higher layers of abstraction. So to me, they will be ways that you will tell the computer what to do, right? It'll just be at a much higher level of abstraction, which is great. It democratizes.""

Chennapragada said it was possible that, in the future, we'd think of software engineers more as software operators, but the role itself was unlikely to disappear.

""There'll be an order of magnitude more software operators,"" she said. ""Instead of 'SWEs,' maybe we'll have 'SOs,' but that doesn't mean you don't understand computer science, and it's a way of thinking, and it's a mental model. So I strongly disagree with the whole, 'Coding is dead.'""

As for the fate of project managers, who are subject, like many other middle managers, to Big Tech's ""great flattening,"" Chennapragada expects them to endure, albeit with modified responsibilities. Taste, she said, will be more important than ever.

""In some sense, if you look at it, there's going to be a supply of ideas, a massive increase in supply of ideas in prototypes, which is great,"" Chennapragada said. ""It raises the floor, but it raises the ceiling as well. In some sense, how do you break out in these times that you have to make sure that this is something that rises above the noise?""

Chennapragada didn't respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.

AI makes it easier than ever to actualize an idea, she said, which means that sifting through the glut of ideas will be especially important — so project managers will need to further develop what Chennapragada calls ""the taste-making and the editing"" instincts.

""In a world where the supply of ideas, supply of prototypes becomes even more like an order of magnitude higher, you'd have to think about, 'What is the editing function here?'"" she said.

Because it's so much easier to just get started, Chennapragada says she's observed less of an instinct to automatically turn to a project manager for approval. Though final approval will become more important than ever, she believes PMs have to earn the right to judge.

""There's an interesting side effect I am observing in startups that I'm advising, companies, and even within the companies, that there used to be more gatekeeping, I would say, in terms of like, 'Oh, we should ask the product leader what they think,'"" Chennapragada said. ""And again, there is a role for that editing function, but you have to earn it now.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-cpo-computer-science-degree-coding-important-skills-project-managers-2025-5,Technology
Galaxy Buds Core get listed on a bunch of Samsung support sites,"Samsung is working on the Galaxy Buds Core, according to recent rumors. These are intended to replace the Galaxy Buds FE as the cheapest TWS earbuds in the company's portfolio. They are definitely launching very soon, as Samsung support sites in a bunch of countries, including India, the UAE, Russia, and Türkiye, have now listed these buds under their SM-R410 model number.

The Galaxy Buds Core have already been certified for sale in India by BIS. Interestingly, the first Samsung launch event where these could be presented is in early July, when the company is expected to unveil the Galaxy Z Flip7 and Fold7, so perhaps the Buds Core will be announced on that occasion, when the Galaxy Watch8 and Watch8 Classic should also debut.

Nothing about the Galaxy Buds Core's specs is known at this point, but if the Buds FE are any indication, expect these to cater to the entry-level market for TWS earbuds. They may or may not adopt the new stem design that debuted with the Buds3 and Buds3 Pro last year, that remains to be seen.

"GLP-1s Lower Pancreatitis Complications, Mortality in T2D","TOPLINE:

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who received glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists had a significantly lower risk of developing local or systemic complications — even if they developed acute pancreatitis — and showed more than a 50% reduction in risk for all-cause mortality than those who did not receive these medications.

METHODOLOGY:

Patients with T2D may experience heightened local and systemic complications from acute pancreatitis, often requiring prolonged and intensive care; however, data on outcomes among those treated with GLP-1s remain limited, highlighting a significant knowledge gap.

Researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study using population-based data to evaluate the influence of GLP-1s on acute pancreatitis risk and associated outcomes in patients with T2D identified between January 2015 and October 2023.

The analysis included 20,459 patients with T2D who received GLP-1s including semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, or tirzepatide (mean age, 58.1 years; 49.85% women); the patients were propensity score–matched with those not receiving these medications.

The primary outcome was the development of acute pancreatitis and the subsequent clinical trajectory of affected patients, including the need for parenteral nutrition, the occurrence of systemic complications, and the incidence of local pancreatic complications. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality.

TAKEAWAY:

Patients who received GLP-1s tended to have a lower risk for acute pancreatitis than those who did not, although this finding was not statistically significant.

However, among patients with acute pancreatitis, those who received GLP-1s had a significantly lower risk of developing complicated pancreatitis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; P = .05) and a reduced need for parenteral nutrition (HR, 0.28; P = .01) than those who did not receive these GLP-1s.

The risks for systemic complications, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, shock, and the need for mechanical ventilation, were significantly lower in patients who received GLP-1s than those who did not (P < .001 for all).

The risk for all-cause mortality was 55% lower in those who received GLP-1s than in those who did not (HR, 0.45; P < .001).

IN PRACTICE:

“[The study] results provide a compelling rationale for reconsidering GLP-1s as not only antidiabetic agents but also as key components in the management of diabetes-related complications, including AP [acute pancreatitis],” the study authors wrote.

Ultrasound Achieves 95% Accuracy for Testicular Torsion,"TOPLINE:

A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ultrasound had a high diagnostic accuracy for testicular torsion, with colour Doppler sonography achieved a sensitivity of 95.3% and a specificity of 98.3% in its detection.

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 63 studies that included men presenting to secondary or tertiary care with suspected testicular torsion and who subsequently underwent diagnostic assessment with ultrasound.

The analysis included colour Doppler sonography as the primary index test, with surgical scrotal exploration or clinical follow-up as reference standards.

Of the studies included, 54 (85.7%) assessed colour Doppler sonography, and the others examined spectral Doppler sonography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, or alternative ultrasound technologies.

TAKEAWAY:

Across 42 studies involving 4422 participants, colour Doppler sonography demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with a sensitivity of 95.3% (95% CI, 91.4-97.5) and a specificity of 98.3% (95% CI, 96.2-99.3) in detecting testicular torsion.

The positive predictive value was 96.1% (95% CI, 91.4-98.4) and the negative predictive value was 97.9% (95% CI, 96.2-98.9), based on 1358 cases of testicular torsion.

The analysis revealed that younger patient age, non-radiologist user status, and the implementation of point-of-care ultrasound did not have a significant effect on diagnostic accuracy.

IN PRACTICE:

""There is evidence to suggest that ultrasound is highly sensitive and specific for TT [testicular torsion] detection. The ideal patient pathway for suspected TT should integrate timely access to ultrasound alongside clinical assessment, with careful patient counselling,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Cameron E. Alexander, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Luton, England. It was published online on May 13, 2025, in European Urology Focus.

LIMITATIONS:

Insufficient data reporting prevented the assessment of the effect of several predefined factors on diagnostic accuracy. Although the accuracy has improved over time with modern technology, previous studies demonstrated that junior radiologists were more likely to yield false negative results in a multicentre European study.

DISCLOSURES:

This study did not receive any specific funding.

Quantum eyes on energy loss: Diamond quantum imaging can enable next-gen power electronics,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

These methods for analyzing soft magnets will help improve the performance of power electronics. Credit: Science Tokyo

Improving energy conversion efficiency in power electronics is vital for a sustainable society, with wide-bandgap semiconductors like GaN and SiC power devices offering advantages due to their high-frequency capabilities. However, energy losses in passive components at high frequencies hinder efficiency and miniaturization. This underscores the need for advanced soft magnetic materials with lower energy losses.

In a study published in Communications Materials, a research team led by Professor Mutsuko Hatano from the School of Engineering, Institute of Science, Tokyo, Japan, has developed a novel method for analyzing such losses by simultaneously imaging the amplitude and phase of alternating current (AC) stray fields, which are key to understanding hysteresis losses.

Using a diamond quantum sensor with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and developing two protocols—qubit frequency tracking (Qurack) for kHz and quantum heterodyne (Qdyne) imaging for MHz frequencies—they realized wide-range AC magnetic field imaging. This study was carried out in collaboration with Harvard University and Hitachi, Ltd.

The researchers conducted a proof-of-principle wide-frequency-range magnetic field imaging experiment by applying an AC current to a 50-turn coil and sweeping the frequency from 100 Hz to 200 kHz for Qurack and 237 kHz to 2.34 MHz for Qdyne. As expected, the uniform AC Ampere magnetic field's amplitude and phase were imaged using NV centers with high spatial resolution (2–5 µm), validating both measurement protocols.

Using this innovative imaging system, the team could simultaneously map the amplitude and phase of stray magnetic fields from the CoFeB–SiO 2 thin films, which have been developed for high-frequency inductors. Their findings revealed that these films exhibit near-zero phase delay of up to 2.3 MHz, indicating negligible energy losses along the hard axis. Moreover, they observed that energy loss depends on the material's magnetic anisotropy—when magnetization is driven along the easy axis, phase delay increases with frequency, signifying higher energy dissipation.

Overall, the results showcase how quantum sensing can be used to analyze soft magnetic materials operating at higher frequencies, which is considered to be a major challenge in developing highly efficient electronic systems. Notably, the capacity to resolve domain wall motion, one of the magnetization mechanisms strongly related to energy losses, is a pivotal step, leading to important practical advances and optimizations in electronics.

Looking forward, the researchers hope to further improve the proposed techniques in various ways. ""The Qurack and Qdyne techniques used in this study can be enhanced by engineering improvements,"" says Hatano. ""Qurack's performance can be enhanced by adopting high-performance signal generators to extend its amplitude range, whereas optimizing spin coherence time and microwave control speed would broaden Qdyne's frequency detection range.""

""Simultaneous imaging of the amplitude and phase of AC magnetic fields across a broad frequency range offers numerous potential applications in power electronics, electromagnets, non-volatile memory, and spintronics technologies,"" remarks Hatano. ""This success contributes to the acceleration of quantum technologies, particularly in sectors related to sustainable development goals and well-being.""

"Novel Drug Safe, Effective for Acute Schizophrenia","LOS ANGELES — The novel phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor known as CPL'36 (Celon Pharma) is effective and generally safe in acute exacerbations of schizophrenia, new research suggested.

In a phase 2 trial of 189 patients with acute schizophrenia, compared with the placebo group, the groups receiving CPL'36 20 or 40 mg once daily both met the primary endpoint of a significant improvement from baseline to day 28 in scores on the positive subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

Both active treatment groups also showed a significant improvement in total scores on the PANSS, and the 40-mg group showed a significant improvement in scores on the negative subscale of the PANSS.

The most commonly reported adverse events for all groups included anxiety, insomnia, and somnolence. In the active treatment groups, no significant increases were observed in the levels of glucose and total cholesterol or in hepatic parameters.

“The drug is effective, and it has a very mild safety profile, with no metabolic side effects and limited extrapyramidal effects,” study co-investigator Maciej Wieczorek, MD, CEO of Celon Pharma, Łomianki, Poland, told Medscape Medical News.

Asked to comment, John Torous, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Boston, told Medscape Medical News that this study “felt more substantial and more convincing” than other phase 2 trials he typically sees.

“I think these were very impressive results. We’re always looking for things with new mechanisms of action in schizophrenia, and it had a favorable safety profile. So it was impressive they brought all that evidence to bear at once,” said Torous, who was not involved with the research.

The findings were presented on May 18, 2025, at American Psychiatric Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Dopamine Modulator?

PDE10A hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate “and is highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs),” the investigators wrote. Its inhibition can lead to a modulation of MSN activity, upping the drug’s potential as a treatment for psychosis, they added.

“It’s completely different from other drugs. We don’t block dopamine receptors; rather, we modulate the release of dopamine. And from the molecular point of view, it’s very selective,” Wieczorek said.

After CPL'36 showed good safety and tolerability in a phase 1 clinical trial they conducted, the investigators sought to assess its safety and efficacy in a phase 2 study. Although top-line results were released by the drug development company last year, more detailed findings were presented at this year’s APA meeting.

Interesting, the drug is also being developed for levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease.

In the current double-blind, dose-ranging, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 189 adult patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either a 20-mg (n = 58; mean age, 41.3 years; 55% men) or a 40-mg (n = 66; mean age, 42.1 years; 62.1% men) dose of CPL'36 once daily as powder in a hard gelatin capsule or matching placebo (n = 65; mean age, 41.5 years; 70.8% men). All treatments were taken over 28 consecutive days.

For inclusion in the study, all participants had to have experienced exacerbation of psychotic symptoms within the previous 2-month period and have a total score of ≥ 80 on the PANSS. At baseline, the mean total score on the PANSS for all participants was 105.

Safety measures included ECG; the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale; and various physical, neurologic, and dermatologic exams.

‘First In The World’

Results showed a significantly greater improvement from baseline to day 28 in scores on the positive subscale of the PANSS for CPL'36 20 mg/d (reduction, 3.7 units; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.73) and 40 mg/d (reduction, 6.3 units; P < .001; Cohen d, 1.38) vs placebo.

In addition, significant improvements in scores on this subscale were seen for both doses as early as week 1 and continued through weeks 2, 3, and 4.

Compared with the placebo group, both active treatment groups also had a greater improvement in total scores on the PANSS at all timepoints (day 28 reductions, 9.7 and 16.4 units, respectively; P < .001 for both).

There was a 2.6 unit reduction in scores on the negative subscale of the PANSS for the 40-mg/d group vs the placebo group (P < .001) at day 28, with a significant improvement starting at week 2 and continuing through weeks 3 and 4.

Plasma testing showed that levels of glucose and total cholesterol remained constant throughout the study.

Somnolence was the most common adverse event, reported by 15.8% of the 20-mg group, 12.3% of the 40-mg group, and none of the placebo group.

In addition, anxiety was reported by 10.5%, 13.8%, and 9.2% of the groups; insomnia by 7.0%, 7.7%, and 7.7% of the groups; and worsening of schizophrenia symptoms by 7.0%, 10.8%, and 3.1% of the groups, respectively.

Additionally, five members in the 20-mg group, eight in the 40-mg group, and none in the placebo group reported extrapyramidal symptoms, which could include akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, dystonia, or tremor and were considered by the researchers to be mild to moderate. They added that extrapyramidal symptoms are “typical side effects for already marketed antipsychotics.”

Treatment-emergent adverse events of any type were reported by 51% of the 20-mg group, 57% of the 40-mg group, and 34% of the placebo group. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported by one member in each of the 20-mg and placebo groups and by two members in the 40-mg group.

There was also one episode of status epilepticus in the 40-mg group, but the investigators were unsure if it was treatment-related.

“This is the first study in the world demonstrating robust efficacy of PDE10A inhibition in the treatment of schizophrenia with positive primary and secondary endpoint readouts,” the company noted in their statement last year.

Wieczorek said they are now preparing for a meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year about creating a phase 3 trial. The current plan is to include both the 20-mg and 40-mg doses, but flexible dosing may be included in other future studies.

Desperate for New Options?

Torous noted that the field went years without a new schizophrenia medication before the FDA’s approval of xanomeline/trospium chloride (Cobenfy, Bristol Myers Squibb) last year.

However, as reported at the time by Medscape Medical News, its company announced in an April statement that the drug fell short as an add-on therapy in the phase 3 ARISE trial.

Torous said that, overall, there is still a real need for more options when it comes to treating patients with schizophrenia.

“It makes me think that for patients who haven’t responded to classical treatments, [CPL'36] is something that is different and has a different mechanism. That certainly could provide a lot of hope,” he said.

Asked whether he’d consider adding this drug to his medical toolbox if further research is as impressive and if it gets approved, Torous answered “definitely.”

“The field is hungry, if not desperate, for new treatments that have favorable side effect profiles and that would work for people who are in a more agitated state. So this could have real importance if it bears out,” he concluded.

The study was funded by the drug’s developer Celon Pharma, and Wieczorek is the CEO of the company. Torous reported having no relevant financial relationships.",https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/novel-pde10a-inhibitor-acute-schizophrenia-safe-effective-2025a1000d1g,Technology
3AM Ransomware Attackers Pose as IT Support to Compromise Networks,"Cybercriminals are getting smarter. Not by developing new types of malware or exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, but by simply pretending to be helpful IT support desk workers.

Attackers affiliated with the 3AM ransomware group have combined a variety of different techniques to trick targeted employees into helping them break into networks.

It works like this.

First, a company employee finds their inbox bombarded with unsolicited emails within a short period of time, making it practically impossible to work effectively.

At the same time, the attackers call the employee pretending to come from the organisation's legitimate IT support department. Spoofed phone numbers help lend credibility to the call.

Then, the employee answers the call. They find themselves speaking to somebody who sounds professional, offering to help fix their email issue.

The spoof IT support desk worker, in reality a malicious hacker, tricks their intended victim into running Microsoft Quick Assist - a tool pre-installed on Windows systems - and granting remote access so the problem can be ""fixed.""

Once connected, the attackers are free to deploy their malicious payload on the employee's PC.

As security firm Sophos explains, a virtual machine is deployed on the compromised computer, in an attempt to evade detection from security software, and the attackers roll out a series of commands to create new user accounts and gain admin privileges.

Sophos says it has seen cybercriminals attempt to exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of data in the attacks.

The only reason attacks like these work is because workers are being duped by criminals, who are masters of social engineering, into obeying their commands (in this case, allowing the attacker to connect remotely via Microsoft Quick Assist)

All organisations must make efforts to train staff to better defend against the wide variety of attacks that can be made against them, including social engineering tricks. Many employees may be under the misapprehension that hackers only operate via the internet and that a real-life phone call can be trusted.

The unfortunate truth is that a phone call cannot automatically be trusted.

In addition, IT teams would be wise to look out for unusual activity across their network (such as the exfiltration of large amounts of data), and consider disabling tools like Microsoft Quick Assist unless they are genuinely required.

As social engineering attacks grow more sophisticated, companies must prepare for the fact that the next major breach might not start with a virus or a phishing email, but with a very convincing phone call.

MAnaging Small airway disease in COPD patients in real life under fixe,"Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogenous progressive disease which affects the airways and/or the lung parenchyma, leading to impaired lung function and chronic respiratory symptoms.1 COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting more than 300 million people globally, being the third cause of death in 2019.2 Increasing disease awareness and ongoing research aims to improve prevention and develop evidence-based treatment strategies.3,4 Dual bronchodilation with a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) plus a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) is considered the basis of pharmacological management of COPD and comprises the preferred initial approach by GOLD recommendations.3 LABA/LAMA combinations increase lung function, reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and lower future exacerbation risk.5 Nevertheless, a significant proportion of COPD patients will benefit additionally from triple therapy that includes inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).6 Fixed triple combinations (LABA/LAMA/ICS) in a single device have been shown to reduce exacerbations and COPD related hospitalizations, improve lung function and quality of life compared to dual bronchodilation (LABA/LAMA).7–9

Small airways dysfunction (SAD) represents a fundamental pathophysiologic element of COPD.10–12 Evidence of SAD has been shown in all COPD stages, especially in more advanced disease, while SAD presence has been related to symptom severity,13 and increased risk of frequent exacerbations.14 SAD may be difficult to assess and many methods have been developed, with different availability, complexity and reproducibility.15 FOT is a novel, easy technique evaluating proximal and distal airway function without performing a forced expiratory maneuver. This has a particular utility in children, the elderly, and in patients with severe respiratory disease or specific contraindications.16 Extrafine inhaled formulations have shown significant benefits on lung function measurements and increased lung deposition in peripheral airways in model studies in silico.17 The TRILOGY,8 TRINITY,18 and TRIBUTE19 studies have provided evidence of superiority of extrafine triple therapy via pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) versus LABA/ICS and LABA/LAMA in the reduction of exacerbations and improvement in lung function in patients with COPD; however, these studies did not focus on the efficacy of triple therapy on small airways dysfunction. Small clinical studies in COPD patients and smoking asthmatics have shown that ICS/LABA extra-fine formulations can improve small airway dysfunction, assessed by oscillometry and lung function parameters.20,21 A number of real world evidence studies have been conducted with the extrafine combination of BDP/FF/G;22–26 however, there is no data available on the early effectiveness of an extrafine fixed triple therapy on parameters evaluating small airways dysfunction in COPD patients in a real-life setting.

The MASCOT observational study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of the extrafine fixed triple combination of beclomethasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium on parameters evaluating small airways dysfunction parameters in COPD patients, after a switch to this treatment from dual therapy with LABA/LAMA.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Setting

The MAnaging Small airway dysfunction in COPD patients in real life under fixed Triple combination of BDP/FF/G 87μg/5μg/9μg, Trimbow pMDI treatment) MASCOT study was a multicenter, non-interventional, prospective 4-week study of 2 visits in patients with COPD, that aimed to evaluate the early effectiveness of the extrafine fixed triple BDP/FF/G on small airways dysfunction, after a direct switch to this treatment from dual therapy with LABA/LAMA. The study was performed at 4 tertiary referral centers for COPD in Greece between May 2022 and July 2023. The study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference of Harmonisation - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Guidelines, the EU-Directive 2001/20 and all national requirements, and was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University Hospital of Ioannina. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to inclusion in the study.

The decision for administration of fixed dose triple therapy was based on the treating physicians’ medical judgment, before any choice to include the patients to the study. The medication was delivered with or without spacer, again based on the treating physicians’ judgment, 2 puffs b.i.d. Use of short-acting β-agonists (SABA) as reliever medication was allowed, except in the morning of the visits; no other COPD medication was allowed throughout the study.

The study consisted of 2 visits: Visit V1 (baseline, Day 0) where informed consent was obtained, and recording of patients’ characteristics and evaluation of eligibility was performed. Subsequently, pulmonary function testing including evaluation of small airways dysfunction was performed and health status was assessed. Training on the appropriate use of the pMDI (with or without spacer) was performed. Visit V2 (Follow-up, Day 28 ± 3): Follow-up after, treatment change, small airways dysfunction and health status assessment were performed.

Study Population

Eligible patients were outpatients ≥40 years-old with a diagnosis of COPD by a chest physician, with a ratio of post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 0.70, a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 <80% pred and Forced Expiratory Flow at 25–75% of FVC (FEF25-75%) <60%. Patients should have a history of at least 1 exacerbation in the previous year on LABA/LAMA via dry powder inhaler (DPI). All patients were symptomatic, as defined by a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score ≥10, had blood eosinophil count ≥100 cells/μL and were able to be trained to use properly a pMDI inhaler (with or without spacer as per physician’s judgment). The decision for the initiation of treatment with single inhaler triple therapy with BDP/FF/G was made by the treating physician prior to the inclusion of patients in the study.

Key exclusion criteria were: (1) a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (ie receiving systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or need for hospitalization) in the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit; (2) asthma or other respiratory disease (eg, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease or any other clinically or functionally significant lung disorder); (3) long-term oxygen therapy at home; (4) pregnancy/lactation or planned pregnancy; (5) history of hypersensitivity or contraindications to any of the components of the study drug; (6) participation in interventional study within 4 weeks prior to enrolment; or (7) refusal or inability to provide informed consent.

Assessments

The evaluation of lung function and small airways dysfunction was performed in the baseline and the follow-up visit, in the morning, with the following methods:

Forced Oscillometry Technique (FOT, Resmon PRO Full V3), measuring peripheral resistance (difference between resistance at 5Hz and 19Hz, R5-19), frequency resonance (Fres), area of reactance (AX), and reactance (X5). Simple spirometry, including mid-expiratory flows at 75%, 50% and 25% of FVC (MEF75%, MEF50% and MEF25%, respectively) and FEF25-75%. Static lung volumes by body plethysmography, including total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and functional residual capacity (FRC). Ventilation heterogeneity via single breath and multiple breath nitrogen washout (in a subgroup of patients, n = 22), including N2 Delta and lung clearance index (LCI).

The symptoms and health status of patients was evaluated with validated questionnaires: COPD assessment test (CAT)27 and Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)28,29 at each visit.

Endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study was improvement in small airways function at 4 weeks after treatment change, assessed by R5-19. Secondary endpoints included changes in other small airways dysfunction parameters, including impulse oscillometry parameters (Frs, AX and X5), spirometry parameters (FEF25-75%, FEV 1 , FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, MEF75%/50%/25%), improvement in static lung volumes (RV/TLC, RV, FRC), and improvement in ventilation heterogeneity (N2 Delta and LCI) at 4 weeks. Finally, we evaluated the change in symptoms and health status as a change in CAT (minimal clinically important difference, MCID 2 points)30 and SGRQ (MCID 4 points).29

Statistical Analysis

Categorical data are presented as n, %; numerical data are presented as mean ± SD or medial (interquartile range) if normally or non-normally distributed, respectively. The calculation of the sample size was based on the primary parameter of the study R5-19 and more specifically on the change in R5-19 between baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. Based on previous reports,21 the sample size was estimated at 90 for a 0.07 change in R5-19, with SD 0.12, using a 95% confidence interval (C.I.) and a precision of 0.025 (approximately the 1/3 of the change of R5-19=0.07/3). The change of R5-19 (the primary endpoint) and secondary endpoints at 4 weeks was calculated as the mean with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Comparisons between baseline Visit and Visit 2 were assessed by Mann–Whitney U-tests and correlations were evaluated with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism version 10.0.0 for Mac, GraphPad Software, Boston, Massachusetts USA, www.graphpad.com ). A p value of ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

We recruited 93 patients with COPD. The demographic and spirometric characteristics at enrollment are presented in Table 1. Most of them were men, with a mean age 68.5 years, and 77% were current smokers. Patients had a mean FEV 1 of 1.53 L (53% predicted) and a history of 1.52 moderate and 0.41 severe exacerbations in the previous year; 75 patients (80.1%) of patients presented at least 1 moderate exacerbation and 38 patients (40.1%) presented at least 1 severe exacerbation.

Table 1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics of Study Participants (n = 93)

Changes in R5-19 at 4 weeks (Primary Endpoint)

The primary endpoint was met as the R5-19 oscillometry parameter was significantly improved between the baseline (V1) and the follow-up (V2), with a mean change (95% CI) −0.49 (−0.66 to −0.33) cmH 2 O / L/s (p < 0.0001) (Table 2 and Figure 1A).

Changes in Other Oscillometry and Pulmonary Function Parameters at 4 weeks

Changes in other oscillometry and pulmonary function parameters are shown in Table 2. Specifically, we observed significant improvements (mean changes) in AX −7.58 cmH 2 O/L (p < 0.0001, Figure 1B) and X5 −0.99 cmH 2 O/L/s (p < 0.0001, Figure 1C). Moreover, there were statistically significant changes in spirometry at 4 weeks compared to baseline, including a mean improvement in FEF25-75% of 3.43% predicted (p = 0.0005, Figure 2A), a mean improvement in FEV 1 of 0.14 L (p < 0.0001, Figure 2B), and a mean improvement in FVC of 0.19 L (p < 0.0001, Figure 2C). We also observed improvements in static lung volumes, including a mean improvement in RV/TLC% of −6.1% (p < 0.0001, Figure 2D). Ventilation heterogeneity evaluated via multiple breath nitrogen washout (N2 Delta and LCI) did not exhibit significant change between visits in a small subgroup of patients (n = 22).

Both CAT and SGRQ scores significantly improved after treatment with BDP/FF/GB by −4.09 (−5.09 to −3.08) points (p < 0.0001) and −8.75 (−11.58 to −5.93) points (p < 0.0001), respectively (Table 2, Figure 3A and B). At visit 2, 73 patients (78%) reached the MCID of 2 points for CAT, while 39 patients (42%) reached the MCID of 4 points for SGRQ.

Correlations of Improvements in R5-19 and Health Status with Functional Parameters

Correlations between changes in R5-19 (ΔR5-19) and changes in functional parameters are presented in Table 3. The improvement in R5-19 exhibited a strong correlation with the improvement in AX (r = 0.85), and modest correlations with the improvement in FEF25-75% predicted (r=−0.45) and FEV1 (r=−0.41). It also presented correlations with changes in RV/TLC, FEV 1 /FVC and other oscillometry parameters.

Table 3 Correlations Between Changes in R5-19 (ΔR5-19) and Changes (Δ) in Functional Parameters

Correlations between CAT and SGRQ changes and functional parameters are presented in Table 4. The change in CAT score correlated with improvement in R5-19 (r = 0.40), and in other oscillometry parameters, except X5, as well as with change in FEV 1 (r = −0.39), and in FEF25-75%. Improvement in SGRQ presented only a weak correlation with the change in R5-19 (r = 0.21), while there were no correlations with other SAD parameters.

Discussion

In the MASCOT study we observed significant improvements in small airways function and health status at 4 weeks after the direct switch to the extrafine fixed triple combination of BDP/FF/GB in patients symptomatic and/or exacerbating on a LABA/LAMA DPI. The study met its primary endpoint showing an improvement in the R5-19 oscillometry parameter, as well as in other indices of SAD, including FEF25-75% and RV/TLC, and additional oscillometry parameters. These improvements were accompanied by clinically relevant improvements in FEV 1 and patients’ symptoms and quality of life.

To our knowledge, MASCOT is the first real-life study using multiple modalities to evaluate the effectiveness of extrafine fixed triple therapy on small airways dysfunction. Small airways are highly affected in COPD, showing epithelial and subepithelial tissue thickening, reduced collagen density, mucus plugging and loss of alveolar attachments.31 Being highly prevalent in more than three quarters of COPD patients, SAD occurrence increases with disease severity,13 is associated with FEV 1 decline,32 increased hyperinflation and worse health status.13,33 Thus, prompt SAD detection and management may have preventative implications as well. Extrafine formulations have shown satisfactory access to small airways, compared to DPI formulations. Peripheral lung deposition of extrafine formulation of BDP/FF/GB in an in-silico study using functional respiratory imaging showed superiority compared with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol/umeclidinium in patients with moderate to very severe COPD, with ICS peripheral deposition being approximately three-fold greater than non extrafine particle.34 In this study we showed that spirometry and plethysmography parameters were markedly improved within 4 weeks, while FOT was evaluated as the principal modality to assess SAD in COPD patients. No changes in ventilation heterogeneity were observed, but this may have been due to the small number of participants that these tests were performed (n = 22), as these were available in only one of the study centers. It has been recently proposed that it is important to distinguish between small airways disease and dysfunction, with the latter referring to a single functional property of a parameter, while small airways disease indicates that conditionally several functional components of airway destruction prove a specific pathophysiological phenotype of a clinically distinct disease, while small airways disease involves several functional components of airway destruction prove a specific pathophysiological phenotype of a clinically distinct disease.35 For clarity, in the MASCOT study the term SAD represents small airways dysfunction, as we are evaluating multiple parameters that may be overlapping but are not necessarily present in all patients.

As a marker of small airways resistance, R5-19 exhibited great sensitivity in assessing the effect of extrafine triple therapy in SAD, and ΔR5-19 was associated with ΔFEF25-75% as the “gold standard” of SAD evaluation with spirometry, as well with AX, another measure of SAD. ΔR5-19 was also associated with symptomatic improvement of COPD patients, as assessed by the CAT and SGRQ scores. Limited previous reports have demonstrated that oscillometry has a role in COPD addressing functional evaluations and assessing possible treatment effects. In a cross-sectional analysis of the ECLIPSE study in COPD, impulse oscillometry was reproducible and indicative of disease severity by Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Diseases (GOLD) stages.36 A retrospective study, including geriatric (≥65 years) and advanced elderly (≥80 years) patients with COPD and healthy volunteers, showed a good performance for FOT compared to spirometry, with significant increases in resonant frequency (Fres), respiratory resistance (R5-20), and reactance (X5) seen in both groups with COPD.37 Impulse oscillometry may be of value in detecting COPD pathological alterations early as it was able to capture symptomatic individuals with preserved spirometry.38 Exploring relationships between peripheral airway function by impulse oscillometry, CT and spirometry in COPD patients in a cross-sectional study, R5-20 and X5 were correlated with the SGRQ and the MRC scores and these relationships were significantly stronger than FEV 1 and CT findings.33 Also, in subjects with chronic respiratory symptoms and preserved pulmonary function, oscillometry correlated better with CAT and mMRC scores,39 and was more sensitive to diagnose SAD than FEF 25–75%.40

In the MASCOT study we have shown that extrafine triple therapy remarkably improved R5-19 in a single month, while R5-19 exhibited a good correlation with symptomatic improvement assessed by CAT, compatible with FEV 1 and better than FEF25-75% and RV/TLC% indices. Moreover, R5-19 was the only SAD parameter correlated with SGRQ. A limited number of previous studies have demonstrated a role for oscillometry in evaluating treatment effects in COPD patients. In a study exploring the efficacy of the combination of indacaterol/glycopyrronium versus tiotropium in moderate to severe COPD, Molino et al found that oscillometry was more sensitive than spirometry for monitoring outcome measures of airway obstruction.41 In a small proof of concept study adding tiotropium or aclidinium on top of ICS/LABA, peripheral airway resistance (R5–R20) significantly improved with aclidinium, while both treatments led to significant improvement in Fres but not in R5.42 Extrafine formulation of beclomethasone/formoterol, in a small 3-month study by Pisi et al, was found to improve SAD assessed by R5-20 and RV/TLC in patients with severe COPD and the improvement correlated with CAT.21 The association of improvement in SAD and overall in lung function parameters with patients’ health status that is shown after 4 weeks of treatment in the MASCOT study further supports the role of small airways on patients’ quality of life,12 and builds on the body of evidence that improvement in patients’ lung function including SAD as early as 4 weeks may have significant measurable impact on their lives.43 As SAD may contribute to air-trapping (also evaluated by RV/TLC in our study) and pulmonary hyperinflation, the early improvement of SAD at 4 weeks may represent a plausible explanation for the improvement in health status of our patients.

The MASCOT study confirmed in a real world setting the results of the TRIBUTE randomized trial of extrafine triple therapy that showed larger improvement in FEV 1 from baseline with BDP/FF/G than with indacaterol/glycopyrronium at weeks 12 and 40, with improvements in the SGRQ total score, in exacerbating COPD patients.19 Although an open-label switch study from LABA/LAMA, MASCOT showed an improvement of 140 mL in FEV 1 , with mean improvements in the CAT and SGRQ scores of −4.08 and −8.75 points at 4 weeks, that are more pronounced than those observed in randomized trials.

Our results are in line with recently published real world data for extrafine triple therapy. The TRITRIAL study showed significantly reduced CAT total score, and improved quality of life, sleep quality and adherence to treatment, at six and twelve months in patients receiving BDP/FF/G.22 Similar observational studies were conducted in German (The TriOptimize study)23 and Austrian patients (TRICOP).24 In the TRIWIN25 and the TRIBUNE26 real-life studies in Greek real-world settings, extrafine triple therapy achieved improved outcomes on health status, lung function and rescue medication after 24 weeks. At 6 months 79.8% of patients in TRIWIN and 85.9% in TRIBUNE reached the MCID of 2 points in CAT, whereas in our study we showed that 78% of patients reached the CAT MCID in as early as 4 weeks.

A major strength of our study is that it covers the majority of physiologic evaluations of small airways dysfunction. SAD can be evaluated also with imaging techniques (eg chest HRCT), however these are not widely used in routine clinical practice and carry certain risks for the patients. The direct switch from LABA/LAMA to extrafine triple therapy is an additional strength of MASCOT, as it evaluates patients in a real clinical setting, with minimal exclusion criteria. The 4-week duration of the study could be considered as a limitation, however our aim was to explore the prompt effect of triple therapy in functional and health status outcomes using a rigorous evaluation of SAD. A potential limitation is that the effectiveness of the extrafine triple pMDI on SAD may be blurred from the effectiveness of triple vs LABA+LAMA combinations; however, in this study we have followed standard clinical practice, as at the time of the study design and protocol development the combination of BDP/FF/G was the only formulation indicated for COPD in Greece. Another limitation is the use of the fixed FEV 1 /FVC ratio of <0.70 for the diagnosis of COPD, and this may lead to potential underdiagnosis in younger and overdiagnosis in older individuals;44 however, our study was designed to follow standard clinical practice and recent recommendations.3,4,45 Our study compared the effects of treatment change and reported functional and clinical changes from baseline, so it did not have a placebo arm; however, the mainstay of the study remain the objective pulmonary function and oscillometry measurements. Moreover, this is in line with ethics and good clinical practice as MASCOT included symptomatic COPD patients with a history of exacerbations. Given the small study duration and the absence of a control arm, we acknowledge that MASCOT is a hypothesis generating study that needs to be confirmed in longer controlled trials of extrafine triple versus dual or non-extrafine triple therapies, that may evaluate the association of SAD improvement with exacerbation prevention and long-lasting improvement in health status.

In conclusion, in MASCOT we showed that initiation of extrafine triple therapy after direct switch from LABA/LAMA in symptomatic or exacerbating COPD patients led to significant improvements of SAD assessed by multiple modalities, including oscillometry. This early improvement at 4 weeks in a real-life setting was also reflected in clinically important improvement in health status and quality of life of COPD patients. Our study further highlights the clinical importance of diagnosing and targeting SAD in COPD and the early effectiveness of extrafine triple therapy in this “silent” part of the airways. Our results need to be confirmed in longer studies that will evaluate the potential association of physiological improvement with exacerbation prevention and quality of life.",https://www.dovepress.com/managing-small-airways-dysfunction-in-copd-patients-in-real-life-under-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-COPD,Technology

"The Best of Computex 2025: AI Dominates, But PC Hardware Still Shines","TAIPEI—Spending a week in Taiwan running up and down the halls of the gigantic Computex trade show, our editors are seeing a significant transformation in progress. To an extent, Computex is turning into an AI show, in the same way so many other tech companies and venues are pivoting to AI. And the show is more vibrant and successful than ever, expanding into more halls and covering more floor space than in previous years. Plus, there’s a promise of even further growth next year.

The PC industry, though, is the traditional focus of Computex, and it isn’t letting up. The industry’s beating heart lies so clearly here in Taiwan, and the PC crowd is showing its creativity, adaptability, and vibrancy as strong as ever. That much is clear in our picks for the 15 best products on the show floors and in the suites of Computex. Let’s check them out.

Best Consumer Laptop

Acer Swift Edge 14 AI

(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)

One of the best ways to stand out in the laptop world? Go light, and go glare-free. The Acer Swift Edge 14 AI manages that with a featherweight design weighing just 2.18 pounds. This 14-inch laptop doesn’t scrimp on the features or performance, either. Acer outfitted it with a 14-inch 3K OLED touch screen, up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 CPU, a Wi-Fi 7 radio, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and AI chops that would still be impressive on a chunkier machine. That’s topped off with up to 32GB of memory (the laptop’s base model starts at 16GB) and a 1TB SSD.

Built with magnesium alloy and certified to MIL-STD 810H, the Swift Edge 14 AI is tough enough to carry and use all over, but it’s light enough to slip into a bag for a commute that feels unburdened. The biggest appeal to it, though, to our eyes? The OLED touch screen is enhanced with an exceptional Gorilla Matte Pro finish that cuts down on reflections by as much as 95%. It does that without losing the OLED screen’s vivid color and crisp clarity. Acer says the battery should last up to 21 hours, too. All that adds up to the best general-use laptop we've seen at Computex. —Brian Westover, Lead Analyst

Best Business or Content Creator Laptop

Asus ProArt 16 (2025)

(Credit: Matthew Buzzi)

We reviewed the original ProArt 16 late last year, and it wowed us, earning a 4.5-star score. Asus brought an updated version to Computex, and it looks like another winner. This is a content-creation powerhouse, combining top-tier AI capabilities with impressive professional chops, now updated to Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 50 series. The new ProArt uses an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU that can deliver 50 TOPS of AI power from its integrated neural coprocessor, and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 for 3D modeling, video editing, and graphic design. The RTX GPU will run on optimized Nvidia Studio drivers. And as for the NPU, that local AI support will drive enhanced workflows in tools like Adobe Creative Suite. Also, it powers AI features in CapCut and Asus' own Muse Tree image-generation and style-extraction tool.

The screen is also great: a 16-inch 3.8K OLED touch panel complete with Pantone-validated color and rated for 500 nits of brightness. It gives you all the color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast a professional creator needs for art, photos, and videos. The laptop’s port selection is top-notch, with USB4, USB 3.2, HDMI, an SD card slot, and Wi-Fi 7 for various connectivity options.

All those features push the already great Asus ProArt 16 to the top of the stack, and added touches, like the Asus DialPad control on the touch pad, put this professional creator laptop over the top. —BW

Best Gaming Laptop

Acer Predator Triton 14 AI

(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)

What we appreciate most about Acer’s new 14-inch gaming notebook is that it’s just as prepared to crunch PC-game frames, with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics, as it is to crush personal-use local AI work with its Intel “Lunar Lake” Core Ultra 200V processor. For content-creation pros, Acer outfitted the Triton 14 AI with a gorgeous, 1800p OLED screen with Calman color verification and a slick-looking, professional build. The system is also quite portable for what it contains, measuring just 0.68 inch thick and weighing only 3.5 pounds. Those are dimensions that rival the 14-inch MacBook Pro—and that Mac is nowhere near the gamer that this machine should be.

Worth noting: This gaming laptop is one of the first to use Intel’s AI-first Core Ultra 200V mobile processors. These are traditionally for lightweight, power-efficient systems and therefore lower in power draw (and, likely, raw performance) than the Core Ultra H-series chips that usually accompany laptop GPUs to avoid bottlenecking. We’re excited to see how Acer’s improved thermal solutions can help optimize gaming and AI performance. For creating a laptop that should be strong for both serious work and serious play, the Triton 14 AI earns its spot on our list. Indeed, it could have won for the category above this one, too. —Joe Osborne, Deputy Managing Editor

Best Gaming Desktop

Asus TUF Gaming T500

(Credit: John Burek)

When looking for a good-value gaming rig, it’s tough to find compact systems with potent graphics for less than about $1,500. To address this, Asus has taken a unique approach with the TUF Gaming T500 desktop: Try a mobile CPU instead of a full-fat desktop one. That’s right, this gaming rig uses processors designed for laptops, up to an Intel Core i7-13620H. You get to pair it with a full-size graphics card.

Using a laptop processor lowers costs in several ways. First, a laptop CPU can enable a lower cost of entry. Also, the smaller chip enables space savings, requiring less cooling hardware than traditional desktops do. Asus says it is exploring even more affordable options than its $1,299 RTX 5060 Ti model we’ve seen at the show (say, with RTX 30- and RTX 40-series Nvidia graphics), but this current-gen model is the most exciting. The Asus TUF Gaming T500 earns its spot for its clever effort to get midrange performance into the hands of budget-strapped gaming-PC buyers. —JO

Best Mini Desktop

MSI Cubi NUC AI+ 2M

(Credit: John Burek)

MSI built this compact PC with ease of use and AI features in mind. The system uses Intel’s Lunar Lake processors with built-in neural processing units to drive AI performance using Microsoft’s Copilot+ software and other applications. The system also has built-in microphones for detecting voice commands, and its nifty power button doubles as a fingerprint reader to increase system security.

This system is one of the first mini PCs we’ve seen adopt Intel’s Lunar Lake mobile chips to bring the Copilot+ AI suite to desktops. Because AMD's and Intel’s desktop-grade processors aren’t yet capable of this level of AI processing, this puts mini PCs in the pole position for AI desktop PCs. As one of the first x86-based Copilot+ desktop PCs, the Cubi NUC AI+ 2M is our mini-PC pick. —Michael Justin Allen Sexton, Senior Analyst

Best Display

Acer PD243Y E

(Credit: John Burek)

The Acer PD243Y E had us and other Computex attendees seeing double—literally. Acer bills this twin-screen display as a portable monitor, and it’s a behemoth. It stacks two 23.5-inch 1080p panels, one atop the other, with the upper panel held in position by four hinges and the whole works propped up with a sturdy foldout stand. This arrangement seemed surprisingly stable in our brief interaction with it, with no trace of wobble.

The PD243Y E’s 1080p resolution is modest by today’s standards, but on 23.5-inch screens, it’s more than adequate for business and light entertainment use, even basic photo editing. For connectivity, it offers both USB-C and HDMI inputs. The PD243Y E may lack the easy portability of sub-16-inch panels, but the kickstand can double as a handle, so you can lug it along on trips or move it around at home. These two extra screens are easy to set up and break down, and you can even VESA-mount the whole works. —Tony Hoffman, Senior Analyst

Best Input Device

Corsair Makr 75

The keyboard supports 8K polling rates for reduced lag, has an all-aluminum frame, and contains eight layers of sound dampening to reduce rattle and echo for a near-silent typing experience. It’ll cost a premium, with potential high-end builds approaching $400, but a barebones model will go for a little more than $200 and should be on the radar of anyone contemplating the keyboard hobby. —Francisco Lahoz, Junior Analyst

Best Storage Product

TeamGroup T-Create Expert P35S

(Credit: John Burek)

This portable SSD provides a novel twist on data security to earn its spot on our list: a self-destruct slider. The SSD is about the size of a car key fob and weighs only 1.5 ounces, so it's super portable. However, the SSD’s dedicated “kill switch” lets you wipe the drive's contents in a fast two-step process that minimizes the chances of accidental activation.

You need to swipe the slider on the surface of the SSD twice to destroy it. Doing this wrecks the NAND chips beyond repair or recovery. Say you’re an envoy transporting government-critical info, and a gunman demands the SSD that you’re carrying. With a couple of swipes of the slider, you can purge the drive of its secrets and hand it over with a smile. As a USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive with a Type-C port, the P35S can transfer data at up to 1,000MBps—typical for a modern external SSD—and it holds 2TB. —TH

Best Processor

AMD Ryzen Threadripper 9000

(Credit: Matthew Buzzi)

AMD’s consumer Ryzen Threadripper processors are robust workhorses that enable near-server-grade performance. The new Threadripper 9000 chips comprise AMD’s latest Zen 5 microarchitecture, which increases speed and efficiency over the preceding generation. These chips target home users who work on intense projects as hobbyists or independent entrepreneurs. For instance, content creators would find this amount of throughput dreamy.

AMD's new top model, the Ryzen Threadripper 9980X, has 64 CPU cores supporting up to 128 threads and can hit speeds of up to 5.4GHz. This level of performance provides an abundance of processing power for a single PC. These chips all run at 350 watts, so you’ll need a beefy power supply to keep them fed. For bringing Threadripper back into enthusiasts’ hands, AMD’s flagship high-end chips earn this year’s spot. —MJAS

Best Graphics Card

AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT

(Credit: Matthew Buzzi)

On paper, the Radeon RX 9060 XT is an enticing mainstream graphics card, priced at $299 for an 8GB model or $349 for a 16GB model. AMD’s 16GB card substantially undercuts Nvidia’s comparable GeForce RTX 5060 Ti by $80 in MSRP.

According to AMD, the Radeon RX 9060 XT should be a bit faster than the RTX 5060 Ti, making this value proposition even more compelling. When it launched the RX 9060 XT, AMD showed off upgrades to its FSR screen-optimization techniques that should bring it closer to parity with Nvidia’s DLSS suite, another feather in its cap. We can’t wait to test one of these to find out for sure, come June 5, but the RX 9060 XT earns its place on this list for heating up the competition in mainstream graphics cards. —MJAS

Best PC Case

InWin DLite

(Credit: John Burek)

We are huge fans of a PC case from case maker InWin called the Dubili, which is a pun on “do believe.” Well, we do believe that this is our favorite case from Computex 2025. And that is saying something, because it had a lot of competition. The Dubili Lite, or DLite, is a less expensive, boiled-down version of the Dubili that keeps a lot of the charm of the original case and puts its own spin on the design. This polished-aluminum and glass tower reminds us of a high-end speaker—complete with RGB fans peeking through the grille. Plus, with massive airflow potential, this case is built to house the best components. It’s elegant, practical, and clearly engineered by people who understand system builders—and have great design taste. —John Burek, Executive Editor and Lab Director

Best PC Power Product

Lian Li RS Series 1000W/1200W With USB Hub

(Credit: John Burek)

Power supplies don’t usually make headlines, but Lian Li’s RS Series pretty much blows up the PSU rulebook. This power supply is a total rebel—it does almost everything different. First, by relocating the modular connectors to the sides of the PSU, Lian Li has made cable management dramatically easier—especially in reverse-connector PC builds, or builds with the PSU rotated 90 degrees.

Plus, the RS has a rotatable power socket at the corner of the PSU, as well as an optional snap-on USB hub for extra USB header connections. Add that all up, and you’ve got a PSU that’s like no other. —JB

Best PC Cooling Product

Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB

(Credit: John Burek)

Over the last couple of years at Computex, makers of PC components have been fighting over who can make the craziest, most over-the-top desktop CPU cooler by adding LCD screens, lighting, and more. Well, Thermaltake just won this round with the Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB.

The Minecube isn’t just a 360mm all-in-one liquid cooler—it’s total display overkill. It has four LCDs that play custom animations, and using Thermaltake’s new software, you can even show videos that have elements running from one screen to the other. You can even pop off the cube and rotate it to whatever orientation works best in your PC. —JB

Best Motherboard

Gigabyte Z890 Aorus Tachyon Ice CAMM2

(Credit: John Burek)

When you are overclocking your PC memory, every little bit of physics counts. (It even comes down to the actual circuits running from your memory to the rest of your PC, and the length of their wires.) Gigabyte’s Z890 Aorus Tachyon Ice CAMM2 is a motherboard that caters to the very discriminating overclocking crowd. It spells out its marquee feature in the name: It uses a new, cutting-edge type of main system RAM, replacing the bulky vertical DIMM modules that everyone knows with a sleek CAMM2 module, which mounts parallel to the motherboard, like a CPU. This lowers physical obstructions, boosts stability, and even opens the door to higher memory capacities.

Companies like Kingston make CAMM. It’s a win both for extreme performance and for practicality. For one, CAMM2 modules can sit directly next to the CPU on the motherboard, and the shorter traces between the two can increase frequency and reduce latency. As CAMM2 adoption grows, this board may well be remembered as one of the pioneers. —JB

Best Prototype

MSI 'Panther Lake' Next-Gen Laptop Prototypes

(Credit: PCMag)

The biggest Intel news from the show was the big chip maker’s demonstration of working silicon for its next-generation processors, which are code-named “Panther Lake.” We saw two reference desktops and a more polished-looking mini PC running demos of several content creation programs and even some local AI processing. Panther Lake is still a bit far off; production of the chips is set to get into full swing later this year, and the first market-ready designs are expected to show up in early 2026.

Intel showed off a few potential Panther Lake laptop designs at Computex, but only MSI was bold enough to unveil off its work-in-progress models. The company doesn't have a name yet for these upcoming productivity and business laptops, but it showed off a bunch of prototypes, and they are a big departure from MSI machines of the past. The keyboards have been completely redesigned, and some of the models are the thinnest the company has ever produced. Also, a new MSI logo graces the lid, which has a slick design and flowing lines that match the rest of the machine. We're looking forward to seeing these next year. —JB",https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-best-of-computex-2025-ai-dominates-but-pc-hardware-still-shines,Technology
Saffron May Help SSRI-Related Sexual Dysfunction,"LOS ANGELES — Saffron may help treat sexual dysfunction related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), new research suggests.

Results of a preliminary new review found saffron, a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the “saffron crocus,” reduced erectile dysfunction in men and boosted arousal in women.

Jeremy Wolfe, MD

“Considering our limited toolbox for addressing sexual side effects in patients, it’s important to continue assessing and researching potential treatments,” study author Jeremy Wolfe, MD, third-year psychiatry resident, Chicago Medical School, Chicago, told Medscape Medical News.

“A large proportion of patients who experience these side effects will ultimately fail the few adjunctive treatments we have available, and saffron may be an alternative for these patients.”

The findings were presented on May 17 at the American Psychiatry Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting.

A Common Problem

Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of SSRIs, with some 14% of patients self-reporting the condition. However, Wolfe noted this “sensitive topic” is frequently underreported.

He noted that when patients are directly asked, the proportion of those who report experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction is closer to 58%.

He noted that sexual dysfunction is a significant concern not only with antidepressants but also with many other classes of medications. It is also a common symptom of certain mental health conditions, including depression.

Switching medications might help alleviate the issue, but therapists are often reluctant to make a change if the SSRI is effectively treating the depression, as “we may not find another one that works,” said Wolfe.

Currently, physicians may attempt to address the sexual dysfunction by lowering the SSRI dose or by prescribing medications such as bupropion, buspirone, or a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor like sildenafil (Viagra).

Ancient Treatment

Saffron has been used since ancient times to treat melancholy and insomnia, as well as to enhance sexual well-being. After hearing anecdotal reports that saffron might help with sexual dysfunction in patients with psychiatric disorders, Wolfe decided to explore the research to see what evidence he could find.

After conducting a literature search, Wolfe and his colleagues included five studies in their review, all conducted in Iran between 2009 and 2017. Wolfe noted that Iran is the world’s leading exporter of saffron, producing about 90% of the global supply. It has long been used there both in cuisine and for medicinal purposes, he added.

Four of the studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while the fifth was a single-group clinical trial.

The studies investigated saffron capsules, gels, or tablets compared with placebo. Wolfe noted capsules are “by far” the most common form of saffron, although it’s also available in teas, liquid extracts, and powders in addition to tablets and gels.

Three studies focused on men with erectile dysfunction; one enrolled women with sexual dysfunction, and another included both men and women with sexual desire disorder. Participants were matched for depression severity and any concurrent treatments for sexual dysfunction.

A 4-week, double-blind RCT included 30 men with a mean age of 32.5 years, whose depressive symptoms were stabilized on fluoxetine (an SSRI) but who reported sexual dysfunction.

The results showed significantly greater improvement in erectile function among participants taking 5 mg of saffron twice daily compared with those receiving a placebo (mean difference on the International Index of Erectile Function scale, 7.0; 95% CI, 4.2-9.7; P < .001). They also reported higher intercourse satisfaction (mean difference, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P = .001).

A randomized, double-blind trial involving 34 women stabilized on fluoxetine showed significant improvements by week 4 on the Female Sexual Function Index. Participants taking 30 mg of saffron daily showed greater improvements in arousal (mean difference vs placebo: −0.72; 95% CI, −1.36 to −0.08; P = .028) and lubrication (mean difference, −1.08; 95% CI, −2.02 to −0.08; P = .035) and experienced less pain during intercourse (mean difference, −1.34; 95% CI, −2.42 to −0.26; P = .016).

Since depressive symptoms did not differ significantly between groups, the improvement in sexual function was likely attributable to saffron rather than a reduction in depression, said Wolfe.

Potential Mechanisms

The exact mechanism by which saffron affects sexual dysfunction remains unclear, said Wolfe. It may influence multiple neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonin, and also appears to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis-regulating effects. Additionally, it may act on nitric oxide pathways to enhance blood flow.

The frequency of side effects did not differ significantly between the saffron and placebo groups in the studies. However, Wolfe noted that other reports have documented side effects that should be considered before recommending saffron to a patient.

These may include gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, changes in blood pressure, and anxiety. In rare cases, saffron may trigger manic episodes in susceptible individuals or cause allergic reactions. There is also some evidence that saffron may stimulate uterine contractions, posing a potential risk during pregnancy, he added.

“Many of these side effects make sense from the perspective of [saffron’s] serotonergic effects,” he said.

Wolfe also cautioned that it is possible to take too much saffron. “From what I’ve read, dosages above 5 g are considered unsafe,” he said.

Symptoms of overdose may include vomiting, severe dizziness, jaundice, and serotonin syndrome — a group of symptoms that can include hypertension, accelerated heart rate, and agitation.

“As with other antidepressant medications, use should be monitored, with annual labs at a bare minimum including blood count, electrolytes, liver function, renal function, and thyroid function,” Wolfe noted.

A Possible Solution to a Major Issue

Uma Naidoo, MD, an instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of Nutritional and Lifestyle Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, commented on the research for Medscape Medical News. She described the findings as both interesting and promising and said she was pleased to see the APA highlight this work — particularly given that this year’s meeting focused on lifestyle approaches to improving mental and physical health.

Research on the topic is needed as SSRI-related sexual dysfunction is “a massive issue,” said Naidoo. “The potential impact on libido is a reason many young people don’t want to start an SSRI,” she added.

However, Naidoo noted the studies were confined to Iran, and the sample sizes were small, so the generalizability of the results is limited.

She said she would like to see the researchers collaborate with other groups, including academic centers, to conduct larger studies in order to confirm the findings.

Longines Marks a Century of Dual Timekeeping with the Spirit Zulu Time 1925,"In a celebration that spans both time and tradition, Longines unveils the Spirit Zulu Time 1925, a commemorative timepiece marking the 100th anniversary of its first dual-time zone wristwatch. Rooted in a rich legacy of horological innovation, this special edition pays homage to the pioneering 1925 Zulu Time model, while embracing the refined precision and aesthetics of modern-day Swiss watchmaking.

Longines Zulu wristwatcht from 1925

Longines’ journey through time zone mastery began well before the Zulu Time wristwatch, with the brand’s “Turkish Watches”–dual-time pocket watches crafted for the Ottoman Empire in 1908. But it was in 1925 that the brand with the winged hour glass made history, introducing a wristwatch that could read two time zones at once. It featured a dial adorned with the “Zulu” maritime flag–a nod to UTC+0 time, long vital to pilots and navigators the world over.

In 2022, Longines reimagined this iconic timepiece with the debut of the Longines Spirit Zulu Time collection, showcasing precise GMT functionality with three time zones in a bold, refined aesthetic. Originally introduced in a 42mm stainless steel case, the line was later expanded to include a smaller 39mm version and a lightweight titanium iteration.

Two firsts for the Spirit Zulu Time

Fast forward to 2025: the Spirit Zulu Time 1925 debuts in a 39mm stainless steel timepiece but features a series of firsts for the collection, including a bidirectional rotating bezel with a brushed 18K rose-gold cap and engraved 24-hour. The rose gold not only adds a touch of elegance but subtly references the copper meridian strip at Greenwich–the birthplace of Zulu Time.

The matt black dial strikes a bold contrast against rose-gold-colored hands and hour markers, all treated with Superluminova for night-time legibility. Five polished stars at 6 o’clock–Longines’ mark of excellence and a signature of the Spirit line–sit above the date window and a tone-on-tone “1925–2025” engraving, anchoring the design in its centennial roots.

The case back, another first for the collection, is fitted with a sapphire crystal that reveals a rose-gold PVD rotor, engraved with a world map and the Prime Meridian. Beneath the surface, the watch is powered by the chronometer-certified Longines Caliber L844.4 which beats with 25,200 vibrations per hour. This self-winding movement boasts a silicon balance spring and enhanced anti-magnetic properties and offers a robust 72-hour power reserve. Like its predecessors, the L844.4 has earned a chronometer C.O.S.C. certificate.

The Spirit Zulu Time 1925 arrives with both a stainless steel bracelet and a black NATO strap, and is housed in a special-edition presentation box.

Samsung's Galaxy apps now work on non-Galaxy Windows computers,"Samsung's suite of apps, including the likes of Notes, Gallery, and Cloud are now available to non-Galaxy Windows machines. This wasn't the case until now - only Samsung's own laptops could use these proprietary apps.

But users are reporting that they are now able to download the apps to non-Samsung Windows devices. You can find Galaxy Notes on the Microsoft Store on your Windows device and download it, no Galaxy Book needed.

Some apps require you to sign in to your Samsung Account in order to work. Galaxy Notes gives a disclaimer upon launch that it has been optimized to run on Galaxy Books and that other machines could have some issues.

You'll find a surprising number of apps in the Microsoft Store when you go into Samsung's dev account - Notes, Cloud, Gallery, Screen Recorder, Galaxy Buds, Bixby, Samsung Studio, and Phone to name a few.

Fortnite’s ever-evolving universe has added a galactic twist with the arrival of four Mandalorian NPCs on the island. As part of the ongoing Star Wars crossover, players can now hire these Mandalorians to gain powerful allies during matches. But before they’ll join your side, a quick set of quests must be completed.Unlike regular NPCs, you can’t hire Mandalorians immediately. Players must first complete the Mandalorian Found Quests, which involve visiting Imperial Outposts scattered across the map. These outposts house terminals that provide the intel needed to unlock each Mandalorian’s services.Once you collect three pieces of intel and return to any Mandalorian, you’ll unlock the ability to recruit them in future matches - for 250 gold bars. But be warned: hiring one of these warriors will dismiss any other follower you may have.There are four types of Mandalorian followers, each with a different specialization. Their services and items offer tactical advantages depending on your playstyle.North of Shining SpanHeavy Specialist; sells Thermal Imploder (600 gold bars)A reliable offensive partner, this Mandalorian excels at explosive support.West of Outlaw OasisMedic Specialist; sells Shield Bubble Jr (120 gold bars)Ideal for defensive players, the Medic regularly uses Chug Splash to restore your health and shields mid-battle.Northeast of Canyon CrossingScout Specialist (limited services for now)Although their sniper rifle and storm circle reveal features are currently locked, Scouts can still mark enemies and chests.Near First Order Outpost, northeast of Magic MossesSupply Specialist (future access to Jetpacks and Blasters)These Mandalorians are designed for resource support, helping players gear up faster in early-game scenarios.With more players hiring followers, Mandalorian companions are changing the Fortnite meta. They provide a valuable edge in both solo and squad matches, especially when outnumbered. Make sure to buy their gear before hiring, once recruited - they stop selling items.To complete the Mandalorian experience, Epic Games will also release a customizable Mandalorian skin in the Item Shop on May 22, priced at 1,800 V-Bucks, with a bundle option available.Whether you’re looking to dominate the battlefield or complete your Star Wars collection, this Mandalorian update offers both strategy and style.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/fortnite/fortnite-update-how-to-hire-mandalorians-and-unlock-their-full-potential/articleshow/121365029.cms,Technology

Anthropic CEO claims AI models hallucinate less than humans,"Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei believes today’s AI models hallucinate, or make things up and present them as if they’re true, at a lower rate than humans do, he said during a press briefing at Anthropic’s first developer event, Code with Claude, in San Francisco on Thursday.

Amodei said all this in the midst of a larger point he was making: that AI hallucinations are not a limitation on Anthropic’s path to AGI — AI systems with human-level intelligence or better.

“It really depends how you measure it, but I suspect that AI models probably hallucinate less than humans, but they hallucinate in more surprising ways,” Amodei said, responding to TechCrunch’s question.

Anthropic’s CEO is one of the most bullish leaders in the industry on the prospect of AI models achieving AGI. In a widely circulated paper he wrote last year, Amodei said he believed AGI could arrive as soon as 2026. During Thursday’s press briefing, the Anthropic CEO said he was seeing steady progress to that end, noting that “the water is rising everywhere.”

“Everyone’s always looking for these hard blocks on what [AI] can do,” said Amodei. “They’re nowhere to be seen. There’s no such thing.”

Other AI leaders believe hallucination presents a large obstacle to achieving AGI. Earlier this week, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said today’s AI models have too many “holes,” and get too many obvious questions wrong. For example, earlier this month, a lawyer representing Anthropic was forced to apologize in court after they used Claude to create citations in a court filing, and the AI chatbot hallucinated and got names and titles wrong.

It’s difficult to verify Amodei’s claim, largely because most hallucination benchmarks pit AI models against each other; they don’t compare models to humans. Certain techniques seem to be helping lower hallucination rates, such as giving AI models access to web search. Separately, some AI models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5, have notably lower hallucination rates on benchmarks compared to early generations of systems.

However, there’s also evidence to suggest hallucinations are actually getting worse in advanced reasoning AI models. OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models have higher hallucination rates than OpenAI’s previous-gen reasoning models, and the company doesn’t really understand why.

Later in the press briefing, Amodei pointed out that TV broadcasters, politicians, and humans in all types of professions make mistakes all the time. The fact that AI makes mistakes too is not a knock on its intelligence, according to Amodei. However, Anthropic’s CEO acknowledged the confidence with which AI models present untrue things as facts might be a problem.

In fact, Anthropic has done a fair amount of research on the tendency for AI models to deceive humans, a problem that seemed especially prevalent in the company’s recently launched Claude Opus 4. Apollo Research, a safety institute given early access to test the AI model, found that an early version of Claude Opus 4 exhibited a high tendency to scheme against humans and deceive them. Apollo went as far as to suggest Anthropic shouldn’t have released that early model. Anthropic said it came up with some mitigations that appeared to address the issues Apollo raised.

Amodei’s comments suggest that Anthropic may consider an AI model to be AGI, or equal to human-level intelligence, even if it still hallucinates. An AI that hallucinates may fall short of AGI by many people’s definition, though.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropic-ceo-claims-ai-models-hallucinate-less-than-humans/,Technology

Bookmarks: Will AI traffic really strain mobile networks?,"Editor’s note: I’m in the habit of bookmarking on LinkedIn and X (and in actual books, magazines, movies, newspapers, and records) things I think are insightful and interesting. What I’m not in the habit of doing is ever revisiting those insightful, interesting bits of commentary and doing anything with them that would benefit anyone other than myself. This weekly column is an effort to correct that.

The headline of this particular column reminds me of something my very first editor at McClatchy Media Company, Larry Kahn, told me. He said, “If a headline asks a question, the answer is usually, ‘no.’”

Recently, my longtime friend Monica Paolini had me as a guest on her podcast Sparring Partners to discuss the impact AI and AI-related traffic will have on mobile networks. Despite the name of the show, this one wasn’t much of a fight. We both tend to think there’s no need to start the hand-wringing just yet. AI applications, as real people use them in the real world, won’t create a massive bottleneck in mobile capacity. Before defending that assertion, let’s take a look at the other side.

In a December blog post, Nokia’s Harri Holma sketched out projections for long-term increases in regular mobile traffic (talk, text, video, etc…) as well as direct and indirect AI traffic. Direct AI traffic is you interacting with an AI app like ChatGPT; indirect AI traffic is apps like Instagram or X increasingly embedding AI into the application to enhance personalization.

Looking ahead to 2033, Holma sees “a world where your smartphone isn’t just smart — it’s downright genius. A world where your device can edit photos with the skill of a professional artist, engage in witty banter that rivals the sharpest minds, and even predict your needs before you’re aware of them…[But] all this intelligence comes at a price. And that price is paid in data — lots of data, which needs a robust uplink connection.”

The point about long-term increases in uplink traffic demand is well made. People are generating more video content and sending it up to cloud-based applications across mobile networks. But they’re also uploading a lot of that video content over fixed and Wi-Fi networks. Considering AI usage today, the bulk is text-based queries, and most of those are (and I acknowledge this is reductive) replacements for traditional search queries. That to say, most of this traffic isn’t workload intensive or net-new.

It’s important to note that Holma isn’t alone out on a precipice. We’ve seen similar research and analysis from major vendors, established analyst houses, and credible independent thinkers.

The Wi-Fi reality check and the mobile plateau

Let’s zoom in on the Wi-Fi of it all. Looking at the US, Opensignal finds that Wi-Fi supports the bulk of smartphone data consumption even outside of the home. According to an October 2024 report, “users are seen spending 77-88% of their screen-on time connected to Wi-Fi.” And, “The majority of American’s smartphone usage occurs at home.” The key takeaway: “While modern 5G mobile networks can offer speeds similar to high-speed fixed broadband networks, Wi-Fi still makes up the majority of users’ data usage connections.”

Now zooming back out. In his book The End of Telecoms History, William Webb has a book, as described in a LinkedIn post, argues “that growth rates of mobile and fixed data usage have been declining for 10 years or more, and that if this decline continues usage levels will plateau by around 2027. Specifically, mobile data usage growth was around 20%/year in 2023 and is falling by around 5% a year…What I did not say was at what level this plateau would occur, other than to note that it would be at a global average of around 20 [GB/user/month].”

Webb continues: “In fact, the volume of usage is irrelevant to this thesis. It is the plateau that drives the implications — that no new investment in capacity is needed, so there is no need for new technology, more spectrum or for new network equipment.” That’s maybe a bit extreme, albeit grounded in data. But what does it mean for AI?

Anecdotally speaking, not much

Compared to an average user, I think I use a lot of AI, primarily ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Meta AI. My primary interface is my laptop, then my phone, then my Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Using a variety of bills and other dashboards, I can say conclusively that the rise in my personal usage of AI has not had a material impact on the total amount of data I consume on my home Wi-Fi network or on my mobile connection. Cox and Verizon have no reason to be concerned about me, and I’d hazard a guess they don’t need to worry about most AI power users either.

Why? Because most gen AI applications right now are lightweight. They’re text-based queries, summarization, maybe image generation. So the traffic isn’t as intense as the hype would suggest, and it’s not necessarily additive to existing patterns. Even the most intense AI workloads — things like ChatGPT’s Deep Research or creation of elaborate slide presentations — happen at your desk. No one is walking down the street conducting long-range quantitative analysis and generating pivot tables.

What about on-device AI?

The real story of consumer AI is around highly-efficient local processing of increasingly small, increasingly performant multimodal models. Advancements in NPUs embedded in cutting-edge SoCs are specifically designed to handle all manner of inference without roundtrips to the cloud. The whole idea here is to deliver new AI-enabled experiences without increasing network load. There are other drivers too around data privacy and security, battery life, and preserving end user experience in dynamic (read inconsistent) network environments. So, by design, AI traffic isn’t being sent to the network. It’s staying put.

Join me sometime in the future, maybe three to five years from now. You’ve got your PC, your phone, your earbuds, your smartwatch, and your smart glasses. These devices are all working together to create a sort of personal constellation of AI compute and interfaces. Because these devices are on your person, they’re an ideal source of the rich context AI needs to be useful. I’ve talked about this before and called it “the human edge;” I took it a step further to also include actual biological information like connected continuous glucose monitors.

This idea of a constant stream of multimodal perceptual data used to create personalized insights is incredibly compelling. I can’t wait for it to happen. But the reality is my beloved Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses need to be charged four or five times and that’s with little to no video upload. Meanwhile, my phone spends most of its time in my pocket or on a table. Which means the idea of some ambient flow of video from glasses or handsets is respectively not where it needs to be from a battery or thermal standpoint, and handset cameras can’t see through denim or wood. It’ll all come around, but it won’t come around on a timescale where mobile network operators need to rewrite their capital allocation strategies.

Once the tech is ready, will people be?

Even setting technical feasibility aside, we’re assuming a lot about user demand. Do people really want a constant flow of AI throughout their day? The consumer behavior to date doesn’t support that. People open ChatGPT or Gemini when they need help. I’d also encourage you to spend time around college-aged kids, which I do because my son’s school is on the University of Arkansas campus. They’re not wearing smart glasses, they’re constantly looking for Wi-Fi, and they have a very simplistic understanding of what AI can really do.

Bottomline, AI is many revolutions wrapped into one. But at its core, it’s a revolution in distributed computing across data centers, edge clouds, and devices. It’s not a revolution in connectivity just yet.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250523/devices/bookmarks-ai-mobile-networks,Technology
"Tariffs live updates: Trump threatens new tariffs on Apple, EU in latest escalation of trade war","President Trump on Friday took aim at another giant US corporation in his ongoing trade war, threatening Apple (AAPL) with increased duties if the company does not make iPhones in the US. He also attacked the European Union and said he was recommending a ""straight 50%"" tariff on EU-imported products beginning next weekend.

""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.""

Apple stock lost ground Friday in conjunction with a broader market decline.

It is unclear whether Trump can target individual companies with tariffs. But Trump in recent days has not been shy about verbally attacking US corporations that have been warning about the effects of his tariffs.

Last week, Walmart (WMT) previewed coming price hikes, sparking a rebuke from Trump, who told the company to ""eat the tariffs."" Last month, Trump had a brief back-and-forth with Amazon (AMZN) after a report said the company would display the added cost of the tariffs on products.

Meanwhile, negotiations with the EU have hit a snag, with the president charging the bloc has been ""very difficult to deal with.""

""Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025,"" he said.

The US has been pressuring the EU to cut tariffs on American goods, the Financial Times reported Friday. The EU presented a fresh trade proposal to the US on Thursday, which includes phased tariff cuts on non-sensitive goods, plus cooperation in energy, AI, and digital infrastructure. The EU is readying some $108B in retaliatory tariffs if talks fail.

Elsewhere, the US and China have signaled their commitment to continuing talks, with senior officials engaging in a call late on Thursday after the two sides stoked concerns by clashing over chips in recent days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that tariff rates will go back to ""reciprocal"" levels after the 90-day pause. He said Friday that the pause was based on ""good-faith"" talks, singling out the EU.

Here are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.

"PSX dips on oil price pressure, budget caution","KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange witnessed a volatile session on Thursday, as the benchmark KSE-100 Index lost 778 points, or 0.65 per cent, to close at 119,153.

The market remained in consolidation mode, with investors showing caution ahead of the upcoming federal budget.

The day began on a strong note, with the index climbing to an intraday high of 120,699 — up 768 points — fuelled by continued optimism and speculative buying in the early session.

However, the gains were short-lived as profit-taking set in during the second half, dragging the index to a low of 119,062 before settling near its session bottom.

The decline was primarily driven by falling global oil prices, which exerted downward pressure on oil-related stocks, according to Topline Research.

Key laggards included Engro Holdings Limited, Lucky Cement, Pakistan Petroleum Limited, Pakistan State Oil and Hub Power Company, which collectively shaved off 537 points from the index.

On the other hand, Systems Limited, TPL REIT Fund 1, Airlink Communication, Rafhan Maize Products, and Highnoon Laboratories were among the top positive contributors, adding a combined 258 points.

Trading activity remained robust, reflecting continued investor engagement. A total of 588.5 million shares changed hands, with a total traded value of Rs30.7 billion. K-Electric Limited once again led the volume chart, with 42.7m shares traded during the session.

“Looking ahead, the market is expected to stay range-bound as participants await clarity from the upcoming budget,” said Ali Najib, deputy head of trading at Arif Habib Ltd. “Key support lies at 115,000, with resistance around 121,000.”

Engro’s telecom tower deal with Jazz’s Deodar clears final hurdle,"Engro Holdings Limited has crossed the final milestone in its landmark tower-sharing amalgamation deal with Pakistan Mobile Communications Limited (PMCL), the operator of Jazz. With all corporate, regulatory, and judicial approvals secured — including clearance from the Competition Commission of Pakistan, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and most recently, the Islamabad High Court — the scheme of arrangement will come into effect on June 3, 2025.

The transaction will transfer PMCL’s entire shareholding in Deodar (Private) Limited, its tower infrastructure arm, to Engro Connect (Private) Limited (EConnect), a wholly owned subsidiary of Engro Corporation. Deodar, which owns and operates over 10,000 passive telecom towers across the country, will now become part of Engro’s growing infrastructure portfolio

This deal marks Engro’s most significant step yet into the telecom infrastructure space. The company — traditionally known for its diversified operations in energy, chemicals, agriculture, and food — has spent the past few years scouting opportunities in capital-intensive, cash-generating sectors. Telecom towers, with their long-term lease models and predictable cashflows, emerged as an attractive target.

Back in December 2024, Engro Corporation had first announced its plan to acquire Deodar via a court-sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement involving PMCL and EConnect. The structure was designed to streamline ownership under a specialised platform. Now, with the High Court’s final sanction, the deal will reach its legal conclusion next month.

Company officials say the new vertical complements Engro’s broader mission of investing in national-scale infrastructure projects that enable sustainable growth and digital inclusion. Passive tower infrastructure — which can be shared by multiple mobile network operators — reduces duplication of costs and enables faster, more efficient rollout of telecom services in underserved areas.

For Jazz, the divestment is part of a long-term shift toward an asset-light model. By transferring Deodar’s operations to Engro, Jazz will free up capital and management focus to invest in its core digital and telecom services. The move aligns with global trends, where telecom operators are increasingly offloading non-core infrastructure assets to independent tower companies.

Jazz will continue to lease towers from Deodar under long-term contracts, ensuring network continuity while avoiding the burden of managing physical assets. This approach allows for greater flexibility, improved capital efficiency, and the ability to better target investments in spectrum, data services, and customer experience.

With Deodar under its belt, Engro becomes the single largest owner of passive telecom infrastructure in Pakistan. This gives it a unique edge in an industry that is rapidly evolving due to rising mobile data usage, 4G penetration, and expected future rollout of 5G services.

Analysts view the deal as a win-win: Engro gains an income-generating asset class with relatively low operational risk, while Jazz exits a non-core segment and sharpens its strategic focus. For the industry as a whole, the consolidation opens the door for more efficient tower sharing, lower costs, and faster rural network expansion.

Engro has hinted that this may just be the beginning of its telecom infrastructure ambitions. The company is expected to explore partnerships and service offerings beyond tower ownership — such as energy-as-a-service for telecom sites, fiber backhaul integration, and even regional M&A opportunities.

As the June 3 effective date approaches, Pakistan’s telecom sector is bracing for a structural shift that could redefine how digital infrastructure is built, owned, and monetized. For Engro, it marks the birth of a new vertical; for Jazz, the start of a leaner, more focused operational model; and for the market — a signal that passive infrastructure is no longer just an operational necessity, but a standalone business in its own right.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/23/engros-telecom-tower-deal-with-jazzs-deodar-clears-final-hurdle/,Business
Update for those looking to Buy Kia Sportage L HEV in Pakistan; full details here,"KARACHI – A major update for those looking to get hands on 5th-generation KIA Sportage L, as bookings for 1.6 engine vehicle have been suspended by Lucky Motor Corporation.

In recent update, the car maker halted new bookings for SUV, citing global supply chain challenges. KIA announced that high international demand for the model has affected the availability of CKD (Completely Knocked Down) kits, which are essential for local assembly.

It said “Due to the overwhelming global demand for the Sportage L HEV, we are currently reassessing the shipment schedule of CKD kits. As a result, we have decided to temporarily suspend new bookings of the Sportage L HEV,” said the company. “However, all orders placed to date will be honored, with deliveries proceeding as scheduled according to the Provisional Booking Order (PBO).”

As booking halt may disappoint prospective buyers of the hybrid SUV, Kia reassured customers that this measure is temporary and bookings will resume once there’s better visibility on CKD kit arrivals.

The company also confirmed that bookings for the Sportage 2.0L Alpha and 2.0L FWD variants remain unaffected. These models are still available for order, with Kia maintaining its delivery commitments thanks to an uninterrupted supply chain for their components.

Sportage L HEV had gained traction in the local market for its fuel efficiency and eco-friendly performance, making this suspension a notable development in Pakistan’s growing interest in hybrid vehicles.

Customers are advised to stay tuned to official Kia Pakistan channels for updates on when bookings for the Sportage L HEV will resume.",https://pakobserver.net/update-for-those-looking-to-buy-kia-sportage-l-hev-in-pakistan-full-details-here/,Business

"Cybersecurity threats: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan least affected in region","ISLAMABAD – Turkiye and Kenya had the highest number of users affected by web incidents (online threats) in the region during the first quarter of 2025.

According to the Kaspersky Global Research and Analysis Team, these countries were followed by Qatar, Nigeria and South Africa.

Saudi Arabia had the lowest while Pakistan had the second lowest share of users attacked by web born threats in the META region during Q1 2025.

Kaspersky experts constantly track highly sophisticated attacks. Specifically, they are monitoring 25 APT groups currently active in the META region, including such well-known ones as SideWinder, Origami Elephant, MuddyWater. The rise of creative exploits for mobile and further development of techniques aimed at evading detection are among the trends Kaspersky is seeing in these targeted attacks.

Ramsomware remains one of the most destructive cyberthreats. According to Kaspersky data, the share of users affected by ransomware attacks increased by 0.02 p.p to 0.44% from 2023 to 2024 globally. In the Middle East the growth is 0.07 p.p. to 0.72%, in Africa: 0.01 p.p. growth to 0.41%, in Turkiye 0,06 p.p. growth to 0.46%. Attackers often don’t distribute this type of malware on a mass scale, but prioritize high-value targets.

In 2025, ransomware is expected to evolve by exploiting unconventional vulnerabilities. The proliferation of LLMs tailored for cybercrime will also further amplify ransomware’s reach and impact. LLMs marketed on the dark web lower the technical barrier to creating malicious code, phishing campaigns and social engineering attacks, allowing even less skilled actors to craft highly convincing lures or automate ransomware deployment.

“Ransomware is one of the most pressing cybersecurity threats facing organizations today, with attackers targeting businesses of all sizes and across every region, including META. Ransomware groups continue to evolve by adopting techniques, such as developing cross-platform ransomware, embedding self-propagation capabilities and even using zero-day vulnerabilities that were previously affordable only for APT actors,” said Sergey Lozhkin, Head of META and APAC regions in Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky. “To stay secure, organizations need a layered defense: up-to-date systems, network segmentation, real-time monitoring, robust backups, and continuous user education”.",https://pakobserver.net/cybersecurity-threats-saudi-arabia-pakistan-least-affected-in-region/,Business
Trump threatens tariffs on Apple iPhones and EU products,"Trump threatens 50% tariffs on EU and 25% on iPhones

44 minutes ago Share Save Michael Race & Natalie Sherman Business reporters, BBC News Share Save

US President Donald Trump has said he is recommending a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union being imported to the United States. ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere!"" he wrote in a post on social media on Friday. He said the new tariffs would kick in on 1 June. The announcement marks an escalation of Trump's trade war with the EU. He initially proposed a 20% tariff on most EU goods, but halved it to 10% until 8 July to allow time for talks. The president also threatened to impose a 25% import tax ""at least"" on iPhones not manufactured in America.

""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's [sic] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump said. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S."" Analysts said it remained to be seen whether the threats would turn into reality. Since re-entering the White House, Trump has imposed and threatened various tariffs on goods from countries around the world, which he sees as a way of boosting US manufacturing and protecting jobs from foreign competition. The prospect of higher tariffs being introduced on imports to the US has rattled many world leaders because it will make it more expensive and difficult for businesses to sell goods in the world's largest economy. But Trump has also backed down on some of his most aggressive proposals after financial market turmoil and business outcry in the US.

'Stay calm, carry on'

The EU has not commented on the latest threat, which came just ahead of trade talks scheduled between the two sides. Trade expert Aslak Berg from the Centre for European Reform said he thought Trump's post was intended to increase leverage ahead of those negotiations. ""We have to keep in mind that at this point, this is a threat. It's not an announcement. There is no executive order,"" he said. A tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter a country, proportional to the value of the import and it is paid by the business importing them. ""But the fact of the matter is the EU is not going to budge. They are going to stay calm, carry on and it will be a very difficult discussion this afternoon."" Shares in the US and EU fell on Friday after the threats, with the S&P 500 down about 1% and Germany's Dax falling more than 1.7%. Shares in Apple, which had won relief last month when Trump exempted key electronics including smartphones from his tariffs, opened more than 2% lower.

'Going nowhere'

The EU is one of the US's largest trading partners. But Trump's complaints about Europe have focused on the uneven trade relationship, as the EU sells more goods to the US than it buys from America. Trump blames this trade deficit on policies that he says are unfair to American companies. He targeted goods from the EU with a 20% tariff in his so-called Liberation Day announcement last month, which set off a flurry of negotiations between the US and countries around the world. While some countries, especially smaller ones, have taken a conciliatory approach, the EU, like China and Canada, has pushed back harder against the threats, saying it is prepared to retaliate by raising its own tariffs on US products. On Friday, Trump said the EU had been ""very difficult to deal with"", repeating his criticism that the bloc had been formed ""for the primary purpose of taking advantage"" of the United States on trade. ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025,"" he added.

'Light a fire'

Speaking to Fox News on Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US wanted to see more concessions from Europe. ""I believe the president believes that the EU proposals have not been of the same quality that we've seen from our other important trading partners,"" he said. ""I would hope this would light a fire under the EU,"" he added. Trump's complaints about the EU have focused on goods such as food and cars. The boss of carmaker Volvo said in response to Trump's threat that customers would have to pay a large part of the cost increases resulting from tariffs. Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters that a 50% tariff would limit the ability of the company to sell its Belgium-made EX30 electric vehicle across the Atlantic. But he said he believed there would be a deal soon. ""It could not be in the interest of Europe or the US to shut down trade between them,"" he said.

While some higher tariffs have been paused by Trump, he has kept in place many levies, including on items such as cars and steel, insisting they will help boost manufacturing in the US. He has long singled out Apple as a firm he hopes to see manufacture in the US, with limited effect. Trump met with chief executive Tim Cook earlier this week. The meeting came after the company said it was shifting production of most of its iPhones and other devices destined to be sold in the US away from China, but towards countries such as India and Vietnam, rather than the US.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5xrygzk5o,Business
Bolan Castings extends production halt till mid-June amid prolonged slump in tractor demand,"Bolan Castings Limited (BCL), a subsidiary of Millat Tractors Limited, has decided to extend its temporary production shutdown until June 13, 2025, as the tractor industry continues to face a severe downturn. The company cited a continued lack of customer orders as the primary reason for the prolonged suspension.

In a notice sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday, BCL said that “the conditions prompting the earlier suspension continue to prevail, given the lack of customer orders due to continued downturn in the tractor industry.” As a result, the company’s management has opted to keep the production lines idle for another three weeks.

This is the second extension to the production halt initially announced on April 26, when the company first decided to cease manufacturing activities from April 28 to May 9. That decision was extended on May 9 to cover the period up to May 23, and now once again till June 13, 2025.

Bolan Castings, incorporated in Pakistan in 1982, manufactures and sells castings for tractors and automotive components. It serves primarily as a supplier to the tractor industry, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in demand within the agricultural machinery sector.

The current operational pause comes amid a broader slowdown in the agriculture and allied machinery market, attributed to weak farm incomes, reduced credit availability, and broader macroeconomic pressures. The tractor industry in particular has struggled with rising costs and inconsistent subsidy policies at the provincial level, leading to subdued sales.

Financial results reflect this tough operating environment. In its third quarter ended March 31, 2025, BCL reported net sales of Rs622.19 million, significantly down from Rs953.70 million in the same quarter last year. Profit after tax also dropped to Rs15.31 million from Rs68.50 million a year earlier, reflecting both lower revenues and pressure on margins.

The management has said it is monitoring the market situation and will resume production once demand conditions improve.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/23/bolan-castings-extends-production-halt-till-mid-june-amid-prolonged-slump-in-tractor-demand/,Business
"UBL gets SBP nod for share split, doubling number of shares","United Bank Limited (UBL) has announced that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has granted its “No Objection” to the proposed subdivision of the bank’s existing share capital. This approval, received through a letter dated May 21, 2025, permits UBL to amend its Memorandum and Articles of Association in accordance with the shareholders’ resolution.

The subdivision involves splitting each existing ordinary share of face value PKR 10 into two ordinary shares of face value PKR 5 each. The bank clarified that this subdivision does not affect any rights, privileges, or entitlements attached to the shares.

UBL had previously informed the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on May 16, 2025, about the shareholders’ approval of this capital restructuring, which was contingent upon SBP’s approval. Following the receipt of the No Objection certificate from SBP, the bank has committed to keeping the Exchange informed of any further material developments regarding this matter.

This kind of subdivision primarily aims to enhance the liquidity and marketability of the bank’s shares. By doubling the number of shares outstanding and lowering the individual share price, the shares may become more affordable and attractive to a wider range of investors, potentially increasing trading volume on the stock exchange. This can improve the stock’s accessibility and appeal, helping to stimulate demand and possibly supporting a more active and vibrant market for UBL shares.

Function over flash: Specialized robots attract billions with efficient task handling,"By Akash Sriram

(Reuters) -These robots don't break into a jig or jump, but their ability to do single tasks cheaply and efficiently is attracting investor dollars as focus shifts to function from flash.

Far from the sleek humanoids of science fiction that are meant for complex and adaptive work, boxy and utilitarian robots - some the size of industrial tool chests - are built to handle tasks such as hauling parts, collecting trash or inspecting equipment.

Interest has been rising in such specialized robots as they offer a clear path to profitability, given the stress on automation across industries, including retail, defense and waste management, company executives, analysts and investors told Reuters.

In contrast, makers of general-purpose humanoids are still grappling with technical challenges, including limited training data and difficulty operating in unpredictable real-world environments, to make them viable.

Data from PitchBook shows robotics companies globally raised $2.26 billion in the first quarter of 2025, with more than 70% of that capital funneled into firms making task-focused machines.

The funding reflects a broader global race to robot supremacy. From Shenzhen to Silicon Valley, companies are trying to develop machines that can take on physical work, with China emerging as a major player thanks to ample government support.

The push has been fueled by advances in chip technology, which has enabled more sophisticated AI models that allow robots to perceive, process and react without needing remote servers.

""With Nvidia's Orin NX, we were able to put far more AI models on the edge than we could earlier,"" said Saurabh Chandra, CEO of Ati Motors, referring to Nvidia's high-performance AI chip designed to run multiple machine learning models directly on edge devices such as robots, without relying on the cloud.

Based in India's tech capital of Bengaluru, Ati Motors makes robots that can tug around more than 1,000 kilograms on factory floors and industrial sites. Ati Motors has deployed hundreds of robots across more than 50 factories globally, including at Hyundai, Forvia, and Bosch, with its flagship Sherpa Tug logging over 500,000 kilometers in operation.

In healthcare, Austin-based Diligent Robotics is seeing traction with Moxi, a robot that handles non-patient-facing tasks such as delivering supplies, medications and lab samples.

""We've found that by solving a very specific problem in a high-need area like healthcare, we can create a sustainable business model,"" Diligent Robotics CEO Andrea Thomaz said, adding Moxi has reached product-level profitability.

HUMANOID CHALLENGES

The interest comes as general-purpose humanoids face challenges such as teaching machines to navigate unpredictable environments and developing sophisticated reasoning abilities.

Unlike generative AI, which is trained on vast online datasets of text, images and audio, the data available to develop humanoid robots is far more limited. These machines must learn by interacting with the physical world and training on datasets focused on tasks such as stacking boxes.

Firms like Figure AI, which aims to ship 100,000 humanoid robots over the next four years, rely on advanced AI to process real-time sensory data. That means such robots are mostly confined to controlled environments such as car factories.

The cost of humanoids is also far higher than task-specific robots. Components such as cameras and lidar sensors can push manufacturing costs for humanoid robots to between $50,000 and $200,000 per unit, compared with $5,000 to $100,000 for task-specific machines, according to industry executives and a market study by startup Standard Bots.

""(True) general-purpose robots have not really been invented yet,"" said Marc Theermann, strategy chief at Boston Dynamics, adding that ""if somebody claims that they are commercially finding a general-purpose robot, they are over-promising and they will under-deliver.""

While the company's Atlas robot has made headlines with viral clips of it leaping, flipping and dancing, Theermann said the value currently lies in targeted designs. Its four-legged robot, Spot, excels in hazardous industrial inspections, a narrow but lucrative niche.

Era Ventures has backed ViaBot, whose autonomous machines manage trash collection in parking lots. Parkway Venture Capital has diversified its bets between Siera AI's forklift automation and Figure AI's humanoid ambitions.

""You'll see a transition where there will be robots built for a task doing something very useful, very cost-effectively,"" said Raja Ghawi, Partner at Era Ventures. ""And as that gets better, people will realize there is a good reason to have a full humanoid.""

"Xiaomi unveils first electric SUV YU7, new Xring O1 chip in bid to rival Tesla, Apple","Hong Kong CNN —

Chinese consumer electronics giant Xiaomi has launched a new electric SUV and debuted a self-designed smartphone chip, in a push to expand beyond its roots in budget devices.

The company’s CEO and founder Lei Jun introduced the YU7, Xiaomi’s first SUV, and the Xring O1, a 3-nanometer mobile chip meant to rival those powering Apple and Qualcomm’s top-tier smartphones, at a livestreamed event in Beijing on Thursday.

The launch event, which also introduced other products like a tablet, came as Xiaomi marks its 15th anniversary and signals a reinvention of its image. The event also follows a highly publicized deadly car crash in eastern China late March, which cast a shadow over its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions.

Xiaomi’s multi-pronged expansion into autos and chips is also emblematic of Beijing’s larger ambition to break the country’s dependence on critical foreign technology.

The YU7 SUV, set to hit the market in July, will offer a driving range of up to 835 kilometers (518 miles) on a single charge. Its top model will be able to accelerate from zero to 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour) in just over three seconds – a performance benchmark that Lei says surpasses Tesla’s Model Y and Porsche’s comparable models. The standard models will come with advanced driving assistance software.

No pricing information or pre-order timeline was shared during the launch. Lei had said in a social media post earlier on Thursday that Xiaomi is holding off on pre-orders and pricing disclosures for now.

Xiaomi’s automobile business has come under intense scrutiny in recent months after an SU7 sedan, the company’s debut EV, was involved in a fatal highway accident in March that killed three people. The crash raised questions about Xiaomi’s marketing of its self-driving technology and led to a temporary slump in orders the following month.

Lei has also made semiconductors a strategic priority. He revealed that the company invested 13.5 billion yuan ($1.87 billion) to develop the Xring O1. Like Apple and Nvidia, Xiaomi only designs the chips and outsources the production of chips to the world’s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).

Lei claimed the Xring O1 chip beat the A18 Pro chip in Apple’s latest iPhones in various metrics, including running cooler compared to rivals during intensive gaming. The chip will debut in Xiaomi’s newly announced 15S Pro smartphone, which retails for 5,499 yuan ($764).

The achievement of designing three-nanometer chips puts Xiaomi ahead of another Chinese tech giant Huawei, as it struggles to make chips beyond seven nanometers due to American sanctions. Unlike Xiaomi, Huawei is banned from working with TSMC. (Smaller nanometers indicate more advanced and sophisticated manufacturing technology, making the chips more powerful and efficient.)

Chinese state-run broadcaster CCTV touted Xiaomi’s new chip as a “breakthrough,” in a social media post earlier in the week.

Currently, some of Xiaomi’s phones still rely on Qualcomm and MediaTek chips, but by designing its own chips, the company seeks to reduce this dependency and emulate Apple’s vertically integrated approach to hardware and software. Beyond smartphones, the Xring chip will power other flagship products such as its tablets.

‘No choice’

Xiaomi’s journey into developing its own chips has been years in the making.

In a post on Chinese social media on Monday, Lei said Xiaomi began developing its own chips more than a decade ago in 2014.

At the launch event, he said the company had invested 13.5 billiion yuan ($1.87 billion) in chip development as of April this year.

“When it comes to the battle over chips, we have no choice,” he said.

In the same post, Lei said Xiaomi will commit at least 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in investment over the coming decade to advance its chips. He boasted a minimum 6-billion yuan ($833 million) investment in chip development this year with its 2500-member research and development team.

In an online commentary posted by the Chinese state-run media People’s Daily last week, it said Xiaomi’s newly designed chip exemplified the ability of private businesses to “blaze new trails” in a complex and rapidly evolving international environment.

“Over the past year, Xiaomi has made breakthrough innovations in fields such as new energy vehicles and domestic chips. This proves that with determination and hard work, no mountain is insurmountable,” it said.

The US and China are clashing over access to the most advanced semiconductors. Over the past week, Beijing has repeatedly lashed out at Washington for warning companies against using AI chips made by Chinese tech champion Huawei. It has even accused the Trump administration of “undermining” a consensus reached at recent trade talks in Geneva, where both sides agreed to temporarily roll back tariffs and use a 90-day window to hash out a broader deal.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/business/china-xiaomi-new-suv-chip-launch-intl-hnk,Business
Gold Climbs After Trump’s EU and Apple Threats Stoke Trade Fears,"(Bloomberg) -- Gold extended its weekly gain toward 5% after Donald Trump threatened to impose sweeping tariffs on the European Union and Apple Inc., fueling demand for haven assets.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Spot bullion rose by as much as 2.1% after the US President threatened a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union starting on June 1, saying “our discussions with them are going nowhere.” US equity futures fell. Trump also threatened Apple with a tariff of at least 25% if it does not manufacture its iPhones in the US.

Bullion has surged by more than a quarter this year and is about $150 below the all-time-high reached last month. Its ascent has been underpinned by the fallout from the US-led tariff war, which sent investors fleeing from equities exposed to the disruptions in trade.

Concerns about the fiscal position of the US government have also supported demand for haven assets. After the decision by Moody’s Ratings to strip the US of its top credit rating, investors are now concerned that President Donald Trump’s signature tax bill — which passed the House and now goes to the Senate — will boost the already swelling deficit.

Yields on 10-year US Treasuries pushed higher this week, hovering around 4.5%. In earlier years, such a move would have been a major headwind for gold as it doesn’t pay interest, with bullion prices and yields typically moving inversely. That correlation has now weakened, as investors forgo higher interest payments for safe havens.

Meanwhile platinum rose to the highest in two years and is on track for a weekly gain of more than 10%, the biggest such advance in more than four years.

Gold traded 1.9% higher to $3,357.78 an ounce as of 11:33 a.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slipped 0.6%, on course for a weekly drop. Silver advanced while palladium slipped.

Microsoft blocks emails containing words like ‘Palestine’ and ‘Gaza’,"In the wake of recent protests at launch events, Microsoft has taken a drastic step to restrain the spread of political opinions within its employee network. Based on media reports, it is said that Microsoft is blocking emails that contain several sensitive words like ‘Palestine’,‘Gaza’ and ‘genocide’. The blockage seems to be in effect for all emails circulated internally as well as externally. Microsoft has also confirmed the same.

The blockage comes in the wake of protests that Microsoft has faced at some of its recent product announcement events. The Microsoft Build event saw a Palestinian tech worker disrupt the presentation on the second day and the following day, two former employees repeated the same.

Microsoft has acknowledged having contracts with Israel related to cloud and AI services but denied any participation of its services in tools used to target people in Gaza. Despite the declaration, the protests continue at Microsoft.

Microsoft blocks political emails

Several employees and a protest group have reported blockage of emails containing sensitive words related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza. The No Azure for Apartheid (NOAA) group reports that emails containing the word ‘Israel’ as well as decoy words like ‘P4lestine’seemed to be unaffected by the blockage. “NOAA believes this is an attempt by Microsoft to silence worker free speech and is a censorship enacted by Microsoft leadership to discriminate against Palestinian workers and their allies,” says NOAA organiser Hossam Nasr.

In a separate conversation with The Verge, Microsoft officially confirms such measures to reduce politically focused emails within the company. “Emailing large numbers of employees about any topic not related to work is not appropriate. We have an established forum for employees who have opted in to political issues,” said a Microsoft spokesperson to the publication.

Global Travel & Tourism to Reach New Heights in 2025,"Saudi Arabia Set for Record SAR 447BN Economic Boost



Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: The World Travel & Tourism Council’s ( WTTC ) is forecasting that international visitor spending will break all previous records this year, reaching an unprecedented $2.1TN - $164BN more than the 2019 peak.



The sector’s total global economic contribution is set to reach $11.7TN this year, 10.3% of global GDP, while jobs supported by the sector are expected to rise by 14MN, reaching 371MN worldwide, more than the entire population of the U.S.



But while the sector is surging overall, momentum in some major economies is slowing.



According to the research, the U.S., still the world’s largest Travel & Tourism market, continues to lag, with international visitor spend trailing 2019 levels. In China, while international spending was above pre-pandemic levels last year, growth is expected to slow sharply in 2025.





Saudi Arabia Surges Ahead

Against this backdrop, Saudi Arabia is writing its own success story. WTTC’s latest data shows Travel & Tourism is expected to inject SAR 447.2BN into the economy this year - a new record and a bold statement of intent from one of the world’s fastest-growing destinations.



Travel & Tourism is set to contribute more than 10% of Saudi Arabia’s GDP in 2025, with sector employment projected to reach an all-time high of 2.7MN.



This success is fuelled by impressive levels of international and domestic spending, with inbound visitor spending forecast to hit almost SAR 200BN this year, whilst domestic spending is also expected to soar to a record SAR 162.5BN.



Saudi Arabia is fast becoming a global tourism powerhouse.





A Sector Transformed



Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said “Thanks to the leadership of His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Saudi Arabia's Travel & Tourism sector is not just growing, it’s thriving.

The Kingdom is redefining what’s possible, and will not only meet, but exceed the ambitions of Vision 2030.”

Like any other technological advancement, aircraft evolution has long been driven by innovations in material science. In the pursuit of progress, once relegated to secondary roles, polymers and composite matrices are now emerging as central players in designing and manufacturing modern aircraft, drones and satellites.

The inherent limitations of traditional metals and alloys are becoming increasingly apparent as they struggle to meet the evolving demands of next-generation aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For instance, the widely utilised aluminium alloy 7075, employed in legacy fighters like the F-16 Fighting Falcon, offers commendable strength but is prone to fatigue and corrosion when exposed to the extreme conditions of modern flight, often necessitating costly maintenance and premature component replacement.

Similarly, titanium alloys, which play a pivotal role in high-performance platforms such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, deliver excellent strength-to-weight ratios but come with high production costs and complex machining challenges that limit their scalability, particularly in cost-sensitive UAV applications like the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. Moreover, traditional high-strength steels, though beneficial in specific structural components of older UAV designs, struggle to balance stiffness, weight reduction, and enhanced thermal management.

These limitations underscore the need for a paradigm shift toward advanced organic polymers and composite materials. These materials offer significant weight reductions and superior durability and provide the adaptability required to meet the extreme operational demands of future aerospace technologies. They also bring the added benefits of lower costs, improved energy efficiency, compliance with environmental regulations, and accelerated aircraft manufacturing. For instance, carbon nanotube–reinforced epoxy composites, utilised in platforms like the MQ-9 Reaper, significantly extend flight endurance by reducing drag and maintenance requirements. They also enable intricate design capabilities and machining complexities that titanium alloys cannot achieve.

In military aviation, specialised composites incorporating radar-absorbing materials and ballistic-resistant layers significantly enhance survivability in hostile environments. Notable examples include the F-35 Lightning II, which employs carbon fibre composites and radar-absorbing materials to reduce its radar cross-section for stealth operations drastically. Similarly, the B-2 Spirit bomber is designed with advanced polymer composites, providing superior stealth capabilities and extended operational endurance.

Despite the advantages of polymers and composites, their reliance on petrochemicals remains a significant challenge, contributing to a carbon footprint that conflicts with global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. Encouragingly, innovations like Lignik and polyethylene furanoate are driving groundbreaking advancements in engineering polymers made from CO2 and agricultural waste, offering a sustainable alternative that supports climate change mitigation and preserves these materials' inherent strengths.

Pakistan stands at a pivotal crossroads, as the global shift toward advanced materials presents a unique opportunity to redefine its aviation and technology sectors. With abundant agricultural resources but limited mining and metal refining industries, the country has the potential to leapfrog directly into the era of high-performance polymers and composites, bypassing traditional metallurgical dependencies. By embracing these cutting-edge materials, Pakistan can fast-track the development of next-generation jets while expanding its industrial capabilities to include vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, UAVs and even satellites – positioning itself at the forefront of aerospace innovation.

Achieving this ambitious vision requires a comprehensive, multisectoral approach encompassing polymer production, additive manufacturing and aerospace engineering. To reach market-scale production, Pakistan must broaden its focus beyond aeronautics and invest in engineering polymers with applications across multiple industries. Key materials include polyamides, polyimides, polyetherimides, polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), carbon fibres and epoxies. PEEK and PEKK, reinforced with carbon fibres, are revolutionising aircraft design, exemplified by the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350, which incorporate composite fuselage structures that drastically reduce weight and enhance fatigue resistance compared to traditional aluminum alloys like 7075.

Additive manufacturing will play a crucial role in this transformation, as polymers and composites enable 3D printing, reduce production costs, and accelerate manufacturing. For example, Aurora Flight Sciences developed the world’s first jet-powered, 3D-printed UAV using a polyetherimide matrix, showcasing its potential.

Further advancements in aerospace engineering are essential for optimising polymer and composite materials across a broader range of final products. OneWeb Satellites provides broadband internet via low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, which use polymer-based materials to optimise weight and thermal resistance. Similarly, the Bell V-280 Valor, a next-generation VTOL aircraft, incorporates thermoplastic composite ruddervators and compression-moulded access panels, enhancing durability, reducing weight, and improving production efficiency. Interestingly, both LEO satellites and VTOL aircraft have military and commercial applications, making them highly attractive for further development.

Developing a composite-driven aerospace industry in Pakistan requires a strategic, multipronged approach. With a strong foundation in aeronautical engineering, Pakistan must now focus on upskilling in composite materials and additive manufacturing. Collaboration with global institutions and investment in local R&D centres is essential. As Aurora Flight Sciences demonstrated, additive manufacturing reduces the need for heavy infrastructure. However, the polymer sector remains untapped and demands government support to build a skilled workforce.

By developing local expertise, Pakistan can establish a full aerospace supply chain – from raw materials to advanced components. Strategic investment in composites, additive manufacturing, and engineering will reduce foreign reliance, boost national security, and enable the development of indigenous aircraft, satellites and UAVs.

""The global economic outlook remains clouded amidst shifting policy landscapes and lingering vulnerabilities,"" the central bank said.

""India stands well-positioned to navigate the ongoing global headwinds with confidence, ready to harness emerging opportunities and consolidate its role as a key driver of global growth.""

In April, the RBI lowered its key policy rate for a second consecutive time, and signalled more cuts by changing its monetary policy stance to 'accommodative' from 'neutral'.

Inflation pressures have eased significantly and the consumer price index is poised for a durable alignment with the target in 2025-26, the RBI said in the bulletin.

India's retail inflation remained below the central bank's 4% target for the third consecutive month in April, slipping to 3.16%, the lowest level since July 2019.

""While policy uncertainty has intensified, supply side pressures on the global economy are showing signs of relenting,"" the RBI said.

In an article on the impact of weather anomalies on vegetable prices, the RBI bulletin said that temperature anomalies have increased in recent periods, raising the need for faster adoption of temperature-resistant crop varieties to support the objective of price stability.

The up-and-comer

Tekever

Portugal

Portuguese defence firm Tekever started out building software before shifting into drone technology in 2010. According to its CEO, Ricardo Mendes, those beginnings planted the seeds of its success. “Good software companies are agile to their core,” he says. “Just look at your phone. You get a new update every two to three weeks and, if you don’t, it starts to lag. That attitude to development is how we approach our work.”

In 2018, Tekever signed its first contract with the European Maritime Safety Agency to run drone patrols over European waters, collaborating with Collecte Localisation Satellites, France’s space agency subsidiary. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022 boosted business as demand for hi-tech reconnaissance drones soared. Tekever has since expanded its Portuguese presence, rolled out a UK-based manufacturing hub and picked up investment from the Nato Innovation Fund and early SpaceX backer Baillie Gifford.

Phil Hanson, Tekever’s deputy head of defence strategy Kitted out for the job

When Monocle visits Tekever’s facility in Wales, which opened in 2023, employees are hard at work on its AR3 surveillance drone. “We manage the entire process,” says Tekever’s deputy head of defence strategy, Phil Hanson. “The AR3 drone being used in Ukraine has gone through more than 100 iterations. We take feedback from customers 24/7, allowing us to update our products rapidly. That’s pretty much unique in the market.”

Tekever might be an emerging firm but it has illustrious neighbours. Nextdoor to the Wales facility is French defence giant Thales; from a meeting room, we catch sight of a 6.5-metre WK450 drone that Thales produced with Israeli military technology company Elbit Systems. That project was retired from service earlier this year amid rocketing costs – well before its scheduled end-of-service date of 2042. “There is a growing frustration with the present way of doing things,” says Hanson, who believes a fresh approach is needed – and which Tekever, with its agility, cost-effective mindset and urge to improve, is practising.

Drones on the factory floor

Mendes also believes this is a time of great opportunity for European defence firms such as his. “The nature of war and defence is no longer compatible with long development and procurement cycles,” he says. “The market model has changed and we’re moving away from defence monoliths. What Europe needs now are companies that can move fast, scale up and work together in an ecosystem.”

The delivery guys

Arx Robotics

Germany

Last-mile delivery is a sector that’s full of opportunities, whether that’s doorstep drop-offs or getting military supplies to the front line while under fire. During his time at the start-up incubator lab at Bundeswehr University Munich, which is run by the German Armed Forces, former army officer Marc Wietfeld wondered whether robots could be put to this dangerous task.

As Wietfeld explored the robots’ potential for logistics, he sought to raise funds for a large prototype. In March 2022 he teamed up with Max Wied, another army officer with a background in finance. Stefan Roebel, who cut his teeth in business at Ebay and fashion retailer Asos, joined in 2023. A few years later, the company they founded, Arx Robotics, has already broken several records, including for funding and deliveries to Ukraine, where its robots now carry ammunition, sensors or aerial drones into combat and wounded soldiers out of harm’s way.

business development

The success of Arx’s Gereon robots is down to their autonomous capabilities, which are facilitated by a mix of artificial-intelligence software, night-vision stereo cameras for a 3D view, and thermal and lidar sensors for obstacle recognition. Crucially, they are also inexpensive to build, as the software easily integrates with third-party products and the hardware is mostly made up of off-the-shelf industry components. Initially, Arx set the cost of a robot at between €30,000 and €150,000, depending on features and sensors. Today, says Wietfeld, “They cost a sixth of our cheapest competitor.”

Arx robots have all-terrain tracks, a maximum speed of 30km/h and a range of 40km. The modular mounted section of the robot can be swapped out by hand in just two minutes and can be modified to carry a stretcher for evacuations, sensors for reconnaissance, a launcher for aerial drones or a basket for supplies of up to 500kg. The firm rapidly attracted supporters and capital. In September 2023, Project A, a Berlin-based technology VC company, invested €1.15m. Nine months later, Discovery Ventures, another VC from Berlin, and the Nato Innovation Fund (see below), along with Project A, put forward joint seed investment of €9m – the largest seed round for a European defence-technology company to date. In early 2025, Arx sent 30 robots to Ukraine. The delivery from Germany was the biggest autonomous ground fleet provided by any Nato country.

Since then, Arx has established a 10-person team in Kyiv to oversee maintenance and production and gather feedback. It found that limiting the size of the robots to about 1.3 metres makes them harder to detect and more easily deployable by civilian vehicles.

Arx is increasing production in Germany and Ukraine and setting up in the UK, and recently inaugurated Europe’s largest plant for unmanned ground systems in Erding, near Munich, which is becoming a hub for defence start-ups. In April, Arx secured a second funding round of €31m to quintuple its production capacity and raise its workforce from 60 to at least 100 employees by the end of 2025.”

Investing in defence

European venture capital has in the past been wary of investing in start-ups that make products with links to warfare. But the invasion of Ukraine changed that. According to a 2024 report from the Nato Innovation Fund and Dealroom, European investment in the defence, security and resilience sector totalled €4.5bn in 2024, an all-time high. Here are five funds to know. 01

MD One Ventures

Europe’s first VC firm dedicated to national-security start-ups has backed everything from quieter jet engines to AI. 02

Nato Innovation Fund

Backed by 24 allies, this fund has deployed more than €1bn in hypersonic systems and next-generation communications. 03

Scalewolf

The Lithuania-based accelerator invests in dual-use technologies with defence as well as commercial applications. 04

National Security Strategic Investment Fund

This UK government-supported venture fund has backed breakthrough companies in drones and next-generation defence manufacturing. 05

Hyperion Fund

This Spanish fund launched in 2024 with €150m growth equity and focuses on aerospace, cybersecurity and AI-related defence firms.

The frontier steward

Frankenburg Technologies

Estonia

Being “mission-driven” has become a cliché among start-ups – jargon trotted out by ambitious founders and written in pitch decks. At Frankenburg Technologies, a defence start-up based in Tallinn, Estonia, the phrase feels more like a battle cry. “We are a single-use company with a single mission: to defend Europe and equip the free world with the technology to win the war,” says Kusti Salm, the firm’s CEO. As he speaks, he presents a prototype of the company’s first product: a missile designed to shoot down drones such as the low-cost Iranian-made Shahed deployed by Russian forces in Ukraine. In contrast to the traditional military-industrial model – which is heavy, slow and expensive – Frankenburg promises guided-missile systems that are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster to produce.

Kusti Salm, Frankenburg’s CEO

Estonia, once occupied by the USSR, now has more start-ups per capita than any other country in Europe. Frankenburg represents a convergence of that technology-forward spirit with a frontier nation’s understanding of regional security. The company was launched in 2024 by a formidable trio – a former high-ranking defence official in Estonia’s military, a veteran rocket scientist and one of Estonia’s wealthiest entrepreneurs – and has moved with the urgency of a start-up. In just a few months, its valuation has tripled to €150m. Several funding rounds have been announced, with plans to scale operations across Europe. The company is establishing research and manufacturing facilities in Latvia and opening a new headquarters in the UK. The company also has plans to test its missile systems in Ukraine, in co-operation with the country’s Ministry of Defence.

Frankenburg has a staff of about 50. Many of its employees are ex-military leaders and top engineers drawn from the private sector and academia. According to Salm, his team’s modest size makes the company nimble. “We’re faster, more flexible and not locked into outdated models,” he says. While Russian factories churn out low-cost drones by the hundreds of thousands, Europe’s air-defence systems are complex, prohibitively expensive and too slow to scale. “Europe is behind and, unless we invest trillions in defence capabilities, we’ll stay behind,” he adds.

Unlike conventional missile systems, Frankenburg’s products are intended to be scalable, partially disposable and manufactured using commercial components. Many of the sensors in its missiles, for example, are the same as those found in smartphones. The company also relies heavily on 3D-printing and rapid prototyping to slash costs and to iterate quickly. “There is no time to waste,” says Salm. “We can’t afford to move at the pace of traditional procurement cycles. The battlefield is changing now.”

Greenjets

UK

Drones might be reshaping battlefield planning but the wasp-like buzzing of an unmanned autonomous aerial vehicle hardly makes for a stealthy entrance. UK-based Greenjets, which was founded in 2021, saw an opportunity to address this and is developing electric-powered jet engines for vertical take-off and landing that emit just a third of the noise.

The company launched its first engine of this kind in 2023. Designed to power the next generation of small unmanned aircraft, the IPM5 was inspired by the helicopter-shaped seeds of sycamore trees, which the wind can carry great distances. Its ducted-fan architecture helps to keep the volume down while making it safer and more secure than conventional engines with open-bladed propellers.

Though it weighs just 750g in total, the IPM5 efficiently provides plenty of thrust. It is now shipping to drone manufacturers. The company plans to eventually roll out models for larger aircraft that are capable of carrying passengers; it has released renders of a futuristic-looking “air taxi” and a timeline to have them aloft by 2028. That might sound ambitious – but there’s nothing wrong with aiming for the sky.

Pangolin Defense

France

Ballistic-protection specialist Pangolin Defense’s signature vest can take a pummelling. It incorporates glass scales to create flexible ballistic plates that make for comfortable and affordable bulletproof armour. Founded in 2020 by four students, Pangolin Défense received an early grant from the French ministry of defence that allowed it to manufacture everything in the country.

The company now makes 3,000 vests a month, which it supplies to militaries and police forces across the globe, as well as the UN. It has also recently expanded into the US. “Our goal is to win a major national or European public tender before the end of the year,” says co-founder Clément Saglio. “That will get us a seat at the big kids’ table.” The war in Ukraine led to a spike in demand and Pangolin Défense has doubled its revenue over the past two years.

Himera

Ukraine

Kyiv-based walkie-talkie maker Himera launched in 2022 to solve a problem: Ukrainian soldiers had few effective, cheap and reliable ways to communicate. “You can have the most sophisticated weapons and equipment but if you can’t co-ordinate, most of that becomes useless,” says Himera’s co-founder Misha Rudominski.

The company offers radio and communication devices that are resistant to external interference, such as that from Russian troops, as well as cheap to produce. In 2024 it announced a deal with Ottawa’s Quantropi to distribute its products in the US, Canada and selected Nato markets. Being based in Ukraine is an advantage to the business. “It has given us the best understanding of how our products work in practice,” says Rudominski. “Our users write to us from the battlefield, reporting any problems. We take that information on board and fix things.”

Helsinki Shipyard

Finland

Icebreakers are key to navigating the Arctic. Helsinki Shipyard is a historic builder that, until 2023, was owned by Russians and was heavily affected by sanctions. That year it was acquired by Québec-based firm Davie, which has been building ships in Canada since 1825. Its first new vessel, the Polar Max, will be delivered to the Canadian coast guard in 2030. “The door to the Arctic is wide open and the West isn’t winning the race,” says Davie’s Paul Barrett. “We’re looking to accelerate joint shipbuilding efforts on both sides of the Atlantic, with a view to securing the strategic interests of the West in the High North.”

Nordic Air Defence

Sweden

Swedish start-up Nordic Air Defence’s Kreuger 100 is a battery-powered, non-explosive drone interceptor that relies on built-in software to locate its target and knock it out of the sky. It’s named after Swedish tycoon Ivar Kreuger, who built a business empire on matches. “He took something potentially dangerous and made it safe, mass-manufacturable and cheap,” says the company’s business director Jens Holzapfel. “We will do the same with counter-drones. In Ukraine, it’s a numbers game right now. To compete, the countermeasures against drones must be cheaper than the actual threat – or, at least, not exceed its price.”

Helsing AI

Germany

Founded in 2021, Munich-based Helsing AI is among Europe’s leading defence start-ups and was valued at €5bn last year. It creates AI software for battlefield planning that’s capable of crunching vast amounts of data from sensors and weapons systems, enabling split-second decision-making. It has also been used to co-ordinate drone “swarms” in Ukraine. Both a technology and a hardware company, Helsing makes products, such as its HX-2 drones, at “resilience factories” designed with local supply chains in mind.

The firm received support from venture-capital fund Accel, an early backer of Facebook and Spotify, and has partnered with French-American space start-up Loft Orbital to deploy Europe’s first AI-powered multi-sensor satellite constellation. In collaboration with Swedish aerospace firm Saab, Helsing is set to upgrade the electronic-warfare capabilities of 15 of the German Luftwaffe’s Eurofighters.

Space Forge

UK

Space Forge is a young company that is reviving an old idea: manufacturing in space. Its focus is the crystals that go into compound semi­conductor chips, which are crucial to the energy-intensive radar and communication systems used by the defence industry, as well as by AI. “All of the things that make Earth a lovely place to live, such as gravity and the atmosphere, are terrible for almost any industrial process,” says Joshua Western, co-founder of Space Forge. Growing these crystals in space, he adds, is far quicker, with a lower risk of impurities.

In the summer, Western’s team will send its Forgestar-1 grower into orbit. Though still testing its product, the start-up has attracted industry interest and is collaborating with US defence giant Northrop Grumman. “Semiconductors are the oil of the 21st century,” says Western. “They underpin all critical infrastructure and whoever has the best material to make the best chip has the biggest edge.”

Oil slides on Trump tariff threats and OPEC+ supply expectations,"OPEC logo is seen in this illustration taken, October 8, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab

Summary

Companies President Trump recommends 50% tariff on EU from June 1

Higher tariffs could hit oil demand growth, analysts say

Brent and WTI down more than 2% this week

Market braces for another OPEC+ output increase in July

LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped by 1% on Friday and were set for their first weekly decline in three weeks as U.S. President Donald Trump recommended a 50% tariff on the European Union and expectations rose that OPEC+ will increase crude output further in July.

Brent crude futures fell 64 cents, or 1%, to $63.80 a barrel by 1236 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 64 cents, or 1.1%, at $60.56.

Prices were already down for a fourth consecutive session, pressured by the OPEC+ output expectations, before the tariff news left Brent on track to fall 2.4% on the week and WTI set for a 3% decline.

President Trump said on Friday that he is recommending a straight 50% tariff on goods from the EU starting on June 1, saying the bloc has been hard to deal with on trade.

""The tariff threats versus the European Union, an important trading partner of the U.S., supports renewed economic slowdown concerns,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.

Meanwhile, the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia is holding meetings next week expected to yield another output increase of 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) for July.

Reuters reported this month that the group could unwind the rest of its 2.2 million bpd voluntary production cut by the end of October, having already raised output targets by about 1 million bpd for April, May and June.

The market is also focused on U.S.-Iranian nuclear negotiations that could determine future supply of Iranian oil. The fifth round of talks will take place in Rome on Friday.

""The growing conviction of OPEC+ sticking with the accelerated output increase throughout July, and the fact that the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks are ongoing all add to the bearish sentiment,"" said PVM oil analyst Tamas Varga.

The supply tailwind offset jitters earlier in the week after a report said that Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, plus the announcement of new sanctions by the EU and Britain on Russia's oil trade.

Energy price cap: Ofgem confirms fall but says fixing could save money,"People urged to fix energy bills as prices fall

5 hours ago Share Save Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent, BBC News Share Save

Getty Images

Households are being urged to shop around for cheaper energy deals despite prices falling from July. A typical gas and electricity bill will fall by £11 a month from July, but regulator Ofgem said switching to a fixed deal could provide better value for many customers. It said shopping around could lead to a £200 annual saving, but anyone currently on a fixed deal will not benefit from the fall this summer. The cheaper bills will kick in at the warmest time of the year, when energy use is lower, but prices are not expected to change much later this year.

Every three months, the regulator's price cap, sets a maximum that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, affecting 21 million households in England, Scotland and Wales on variable tariffs. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. The drop in price is the first for a year, meaning a household using a typical amount of energy will see their annual bill fall by £129.

Prices remain high

Customers on variable deals can estimate their own potential saving in energy bills in July by knocking 7% off their monthly direct debit. Typically, that will be about £11 a month. Ofgem has said while its price cap will be lower, there are cheaper deals being offered for fixed deals, which usually last a year, by some suppliers. Securing a fixed deal can offer people certainty over monthly payments. ""I want to remind people is that you don't have to pay the price cap – there are better deals out there so it's important to shop around, and talk to your existing supplier about the best deal they can offer you,"" said Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem. Currently 35% of billpayers are on a fixed tariff, up from just 15% a year ago when fewer offers were available. But not everyone can switch, including anyone in debt to their supplier. ""Others may simply lack confidence due to previous bad experiences with moving to another supplier or fixed deal. This means we can't rely on the benefits of switching alone to help these households afford their bills,"" said Peter Smith, from charity National Energy Action. Mr Jarvis said the drop in energy bills in July reflected a fall in the international price of wholesale gas. ""However, we're acutely aware that prices remain high, and some continue to struggle with the cost of energy,"" he said. Households were hit by a series of bill hikes for energy, water and council tax at the start of April, which drove inflation, which charts the rising cost of living, to its highest for more than a year. However, official figures released on Friday showed retail sales rose by 1.2% in April, the fourth monthly increase in a row, in a sign consumers were willing to spend more on food and household goods. Warmer temperatures and sunny weather also drove sales higher, the Office for National Statistics said.

Although the energy cap changes every three months, the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. This typical household is assumed to use 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The 7% fall will mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit will cost £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. It will also more than reverse the £111 increase under the current price cap, which came into force at the start of April. However, prices will still be higher than a year earlier, and significantly above levels seen at the start of the decade.

High bills in recent years have also led to ballooning levels of customer debt to suppliers, with just under £4bn owed. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said the latest energy price cap announcement would be ""cold comfort to the millions paying off a mountain of debt on top of their monthly costs"". ""The government has said it hopes to provide more support to pensioners this winter, but we know that people with children are often struggling most of all with energy,"" she said. ""It must provide more targeted energy bill support to those hardest hit, and upgrade five million homes with money-saving energy efficiency measures.""

Gillian Roberts says she keeps a close eye on her meter

At Seedley Pavilion Community Cafe and Gardens in Salford, they are growing produce to try to keep costs down. Gillian Roberts, 49, said it was ""about time"" energy prices start to fall. ""I used to stay at my friend's house most of the time so I wouldn't be at my flat using energy. I'd be there so we could split the cost of energy and pay it together,"" she said. ""I have a meter that I read once a month and I just keep my eye on things as much as I possibly can.""

Winter fuel payment row

The price cap announcement comes just two days after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer signalled a partial U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments. More than 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments, worth up to £300 when the top-up became means-tested last year. However, Sir Keir said on Wednesday that the government wanted ""more pensioners"" to be eligible again. It remains unclear how many will regain their entitlement for the payments, how that will be achieved, or when the changes will take effect.

Standing charges

Bills are calculated based on individual usage. However, standing charges, which cover the cost of being connected to an energy supply, are fixed. The regulator said these charges would typically drop by £19 a year under the July cap for people on variable tariffs or prepayment meters, although they vary sharply by region. The latest changes mean that in July: Gas prices will be capped at an average of 6.33p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 25.73p per kWh - down from 6.99p and 27.03p respectively. A typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas

Households on pre-payment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical annual bill of £1,672

Those who pay their bills by cash or cheque will pay more, with a typical annual bill of £1,855

Standing charges will fall to 51.37p a day for electricity and to 29.82p a day for gas, compared with 53.8p and 32.67p respectively, although they vary by region The regulator is considering changes to the system of standing charges, although that has brought renewed debate over how they operate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7zdzz83y0o,Business
"Exclusive: Musk’s DOGE expanding his Grok AI in US government, raising conflict concerns","Summary

Companies Grok AI use raises privacy and conflict-of-interest concerns

DOGE team allegedly pushes Grok at DHS without approval

Experts warn of potential unfair advantage for Musk's xAI in federal contracts

May 23 (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk’s DOGE team is expanding use of his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok in the U.S. federal government to analyze data, said three people familiar with the matter, potentially violating conflict-of-interest laws and putting at risk sensitive information on millions of Americans.

Such use of Grok could reinforce concerns among privacy advocates and others that Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team appears to be casting aside long-established protections over the handling of sensitive data as President Donald Trump shakes up the U.S. bureaucracy.

Sign up here.

One of the three people familiar with the matter, who has knowledge of DOGE’s activities, said Musk's team was using a customized version of the Grok chatbot. The apparent aim was for DOGE to sift through data more efficiently, this person said. “They ask questions, get it to prepare reports, give data analysis.”

The second and third person said DOGE staff also told Department of Homeland Security officials to use it even though Grok had not been approved within the department.

Reuters could not determine the specific data that had been fed into the generative AI tool or how the custom system was set up. Grok was developed by xAI, a tech operation that Musk launched in 2023 on his social media platform, X.

If the data was sensitive or confidential government information, the arrangement could violate security and privacy laws, said five specialists in technology and government ethics.

It could also give the Tesla and SpaceX CEO access to valuable nonpublic federal contracting data at agencies he privately does business with or be used to help train Grok, a process in which AI models analyze troves of data, the experts said. Musk could also gain an unfair competitive advantage over other AI service providers from use of Grok in the federal government, they added.

Musk, the White House and xAI did not respond to requests for comment. A Homeland Security spokesperson denied DOGE had pressed DHS staff to use Grok. “DOGE hasn’t pushed any employees to use any particular tools or products,” said the spokesperson, who did not respond to further questions. “DOGE is here to find and fight waste, fraud and abuse.”

Musk's xAI, an industry newcomer compared to rivals OpenAI and Anthropic, says on its website that it may monitor Grok users for “specific business purposes.” ""AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible,"" the website says.

As part of Musk's stated push to eliminate government waste and inefficiency, the billionaire and his DOGE team have accessed heavily safeguarded federal databases that store personal information on millions of Americans. Experts said that data is typically off limits to all but a handful of officials because of the risk that it could be sold, lost, leaked, violate the privacy of Americans or expose the country to security threats.

Typically, data sharing within the federal government requires agency authorization and the involvement of government specialists to ensure compliance with privacy, confidentiality and other laws.

Analyzing sensitive federal data with Grok would mark an important shift in the work of DOGE, a team of software engineers and others connected to Musk. They have overseen the firing of thousands of federal workers, seized control of sensitive data systems and sought to dismantle agencies in the name of combating alleged waste, fraud and abuse.

“Given the scale of data that DOGE has amassed and given the numerous concerns of porting that data into software like Grok, this to me is about as serious a privacy threat as you get,” said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a nonprofit that advocates for privacy.

His concerns include the risk that government data will leak back to xAI, a private company, and a lack of clarity over who has access to this custom version of Grok.

DOGE's access to federal information could give Grok and xAI an edge over other potential AI contractors looking to provide government services, said Cary Coglianese, an expert on federal regulations and ethics at the University of Pennsylvania. “The company has a financial interest in insisting that their product be used by federal employees,” he said.

“APPEARANCE OF SELF-DEALING”

In addition to using Grok for its own analysis of government data, DOGE staff told DHS officials over the last two months to use Grok even though it had not been approved for use at the sprawling agency, said the second and third person. DHS oversees border security, immigration enforcement, cybersecurity and other sensitive national security functions.

If federal employees are officially given access to Grok for such use, the federal government has to pay Musk’s organization for access, the people said.

“They were pushing it to be used across the department,” said one of the people.

Reuters could not independently establish if and how much the federal government would have been charged to use Grok. Reporters also couldn’t determine if DHS workers followed the directive by DOGE staff to use Grok or ignored the request.

DHS, under the previous Biden administration, created policies last year allowing its staff to use specific AI platforms, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Claude chatbot developed by Anthropic and another AI tool developed by Grammarly. DHS also created an internal DHS chatbot.

The aim was to make DHS among the first federal agencies to embrace the technology and use generative AI, which can write research reports and carry out other complex tasks in response to prompts. Under the policy, staff could use the commercial bots for non-sensitive, non-confidential data, while DHS’s internal bot could be fed more sensitive data, records posted on DHS’s website show.

In May, DHS officials abruptly shut down employee access to all commercial AI tools – including ChatGPT – after workers were suspected of improperly using them with sensitive data, said the second and third sources. Instead, staff can still use the internal DHS AI tool. Reuters could not determine whether this prevented DOGE from promoting Grok at DHS.

DHS did not respond to questions about the matter.

Musk, the world’s richest person, told investors last month that he would reduce his time with DOGE to a day or two a week starting in May. As a special government employee, he can only serve for 130 days. It's unclear when that term ends. If he reduces his hours to part time, he could extend his term beyond May. He has said, however, that his DOGE team will continue with their work as he winds down his role at the White House.

If Musk was directly involved in decisions to use Grok, it could violate a criminal conflict-of-interest statute which bars officials -- including special government employees -- from participating in matters that could benefit them financially, said Richard Painter, ethics counsel to former Republican President George W. Bush and a University of Minnesota professor.

“This gives the appearance that DOGE is pressuring agencies to use software to enrich Musk and xAI, and not to the benefit of the American people,” said Painter. The statute is rarely prosecuted but can result in fines or jail time.

If DOGE staffers were pushing Grok’s use without Musk’s involvement, for instance to ingratiate themselves with the billionaire, that would be ethically problematic but not a violation of the conflict-of-interest statute, said Painter. “We can’t prosecute it, but it would be the job of the White House to prevent it. It gives the appearance of self-dealing.”

The push to use Grok coincides with a larger DOGE effort led by two staffers on Musk’s team, Kyle Schutt and Edward Coristine, to use AI in the federal bureaucracy, said two other people familiar with DOGE’s operations. Coristine, a 19-year-old who has used the online moniker ""Big Balls,"" is one of DOGE’s highest-profile members.

Schutt and Coristine did not respond to requests for comment.

DOGE staffers have attempted to gain access to DHS employee emails in recent months and ordered staff to train AI to identify communications suggesting an employee is not “loyal” to Trump’s political agenda, the two sources said. Reuters could not establish whether Grok was used for such surveillance.

In the last few weeks, a group of roughly a dozen workers at a Department of Defense agency were told by a supervisor that an algorithmic tool was monitoring some of their computer activity, according to two additional people briefed on the conversations.

Reuters also reviewed two separate text message exchanges by people who were directly involved in the conversations. The sources asked that the specific agency not be named out of concern over potential retribution. They were not aware of what tool was being used.

Using AI to identify the personal political beliefs of employees could violate civil service laws aimed at shielding career civil servants from political interference, said Coglianese, the expert on federal regulations and ethics at the University of Pennsylvania.

In a statement to Reuters, the Department of Defense said the department’s DOGE team had not been involved in any network monitoring nor had DOGE been “directed” to use any AI tools, including Grok. “It’s important to note that all government computers are inherently subject to monitoring as part of the standard user agreement,” said Kingsley Wilson, a Pentagon spokesperson.

The department did not respond to follow-up questions about whether any new monitoring systems had been deployed recently.

Meeting highlights from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 19-22 May 2025,"Ten new medicines recommended for approval

EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) recommended ten medicines for approval at its May 2025 meeting.

The committee recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for Aucatzyl* (obecabtagene autoleucel), for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a type of cancer of the white blood cells. This medicine was supported through EMA's PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme, which provides early and enhanced scientific and regulatory support for promising medicines with a potential to address unmet medical needs. See more details in the news announcement in the grid below.

A positive opinion was adopted for Blenrep* (belantamab mafodotin), for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, a rare and incurable disease of the plasma cells, which typically affects adults from 60 years of age.

The committee recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for Ezmekly* (mirdametinib), for the treatment of paediatric and adult patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, an inherited disease in which the patient develops benign (non-cancerous) tumours along the nerves.

Itovebi (inavolisib) received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of adults with PIK3CA-mutated, oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer.

The CHMP adopted a positive opinion under exceptional circumstances for Maapliv* (amino acids), for the treatment of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) in patients from birth. MSUD is a rare genetic disorder where the body cannot break down certain amino acids found in proteins. This leads to a buildup of harmful substances in the blood and urine, which can cause serious health problems.

The CHMP recommended granting a marketing authorisation for Riulvy (tegomil fumarate), for the treatment of adults and children from 13 years of age with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, a disease of the brain and spinal cord in which inflammation destroys the protective covering around nerves and the nerves themselves. This medicine was submitted in a hybrid application, which relies in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials of an already-authorised reference product and in part on new data.

The committee adopted positive opinions for three biosimilar medicines:

Bomyntra (denosumab), for the prevention of skeletal related events in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone and the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone.

(denosumab), for the prevention of skeletal related events in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone and the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone. Conexxence (denosumab), for the treatment of osteoporosis, a disease that makes bones fragile, in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fractures.

(denosumab), for the treatment of osteoporosis, a disease that makes bones fragile, in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fractures. Rolcya (denosumab), for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone loss.

A generic medicine, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide Viatris (emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide), received a positive opinion for the treatment of adults and adolescents infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).

Negative opinion for two medicines

The committee recommended not granting a paediatric-use marketing authorisation for Atropine sulfate FGK (atropine), a medicine intended for treating myopia in children aged three years and older.

Kinselby* (resminostat) received a negative opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of patients with advanced stage mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, two cancers of blood cells that affect mainly the skin.

For more information on these negative opinions, see the question-and-answer documents in the grid below.

Recommendations on extensions of therapeutic indication for four medicines

The committee recommended extensions of indication for four medicines that are already authorised in the European Union (EU): Imfinzi, Rezolsta, Saxenda and Tevimbra.

Re-examination of recommendations

On 28 June 2024, the European Commission revoked the refusal of a marketing authorisation for Aplidin (plitidepsin), a medicine expected to be used to treat multiple myeloma. Following the adoption of this decision, the Commission has requested EMA to re-start the re-examination of the negative opinion adopted by the CHMP in December 2017.

The marketing authorisation holder for Winlevi (clascoterone), a medicine intended for treating acne vulgaris, has requested a re-examination of the negative opinion adopted during the committee’s April 2025 meeting.

Upon receipt of the grounds of these requests, the CHMP will re-examine its opinions and issue final recommendations.

Withdrawal of applications

An application for an initial marketing authorisation was withdrawn. Teriparatide Ascend (teriparatide) was intended for the treatment of osteoporosis.

An application to extend the therapeutic indication of Lutathera (lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide) in the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed tumours in the gut, known as gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, was also withdrawn.

Question-and-answer documents on the withdrawals of these medicines are available in the grid below.

Conclusion of referral

The committee finalised its review of the use of azithromycin, an antibiotic that has been used for decades to treat a wide range of infectious diseases. The CHMP has recommended several changes, including revisions and removals of certain indications. These recommendations aim to optimise the use of this common antibiotic and minimise the development of antimicrobial resistance, the ability of microorganisms to become resistant to antimicrobials.

For more information on this recommendation see the public health communication in the grid below.

Start of referral

The CHMP started a review of all available information on the benefits and risks of medicines containing ipidacrine. These medicines have been authorised in several EU countries through national procedures and are used in adults to treat different conditions affecting the nervous system. The review of ipidacrine-containing medicines has been initiated at the request of the Irish medicines regulatory agency, under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC.

For more information, see the public health communication in the grid below.

Agenda and minutes

The agenda of the May 2025 CHMP meeting is published on EMA's website. Minutes of the meeting will be published in the coming weeks.

Protestors accuse Trump of corruption as he hosts crypto dinner,"Protestors accuse Trump of corruption as he hosts crypto gala dinner

US President Donald Trump has hosted top purchasers of the cryptocurrency that bears his name at a gala dinner, in an event that protesters and his Democrat opponents branded as ""corrupt"". $TRUMP was launched shortly before his inauguration in January, initially rocketing in value before falling sharply afterwards. ""It's fundamentally corrupt - a way to buy access to the President,"" Democrat senator Chris Murphy wrote on X. Protesters gathered outside the event on Thursday night, which was held at a golf course near Washington DC, some carrying signs reading ""stop crypto corruption"" and ""no kings.""

The White House has rejected the accusations, and in a video of the dinner posted on social media, Trump is seen saying ""I always put the country way ahead of the business."" ""The Biden administration persecuted crypto innovators and we're bringing them back into the USA where they belong,"" Trump is also recorded as saying. The event took place as Bitcoin - the leading cryptocurrency - was hitting a fresh record high price in dollar terms of almost $112,000 (£83,000) per coin, before falling back slightly.

What is $TRUMP?

$TRUMP is what is known as a meme coin - a type of cryptocurrency inspired by internet memes or viral online trends. Its price peaked at $75 in January before plummeting to less than $8 in April - it was trading at around $12.50 at the time of writing. ""This is something that doesn't have obvious utility. It's not being used for payments. It's not being used as a store of value,"" said Rob Hadick, General Partner of Dragonfly, a crypto venture fund. The dinner was advertised on the website gettrumpmemes.com as ""the most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World."" The top 220 purchasers of the meme coin, viewable on a leaderboard, received invitations to the ""black-tie optional"" event.

The top investor in the $TRUMP meme coin is billionaire crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun who was charged with fraud and market manipulation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. In February, the Trump administration paused the case. Sun said this week on the social media platform X that he planned to attend the dinner, calling himself Trump's ""TOP fan!"" Sun then made a series of posts on Thursday night on X, including one that said it was an ""honour"" to attend the dinner. Earlier in the day, Democrat senators held a press conference to denounce the event and to call for disclosure of who would be attending. Calling the dinner ""an orgy of corruption,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren slammed Trump for ""using the presidency of the United States to make himself richer through crypto.""

From crypto critic to investor

Trump's views on cryptocurrency have undergone radical change in recent years. In 2021, he called Bitcoin a ""scam."" Now, he's not just in charge of regulating cryptocurrencies in the US - he and his family are active industry participants. In addition to the meme coin, the Trump family also holds a majority stake in the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which was launched just prior to the election. Trump expressed his desire to be the nation's first ""Crypto President"" while campaigning for his second term, and was a major beneficiary of campaign contributions from the crypto industry in the 2024 election. According to a report by the group State Democracy Defenders Action, Trump's investments in crypto have helped boost his net worth by as much as $2.9bn. ""As a stakeholder in crypto assets, President Trump will likely profit from the very policies he is pursuing,"" the report states. Three days into his term, Trump issued an executive order to establish a regulatory framework that promotes the growth of digital currencies. A Trump administration official told the BBC that the meme coin has nothing to do with the White House. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly pushed back on concerns about potential conflicts. ""The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself,"" Kelly said in a statement. But one former financial regulator likened the meme coin to gambling. ""It's like selling membership cards for his personal fan club which are then traded,"" said Timothy Massad, Director of the Digital Asset Policy Project at Harvard. ""They have no value. But people speculate on the price and those purchases and that trading enriches him.""

AI system resorts to blackmail if told it will be removed,"AI system resorts to blackmail if told it will be removed

Anthropic released the next iterations of its Claude AI models on Thursday.

Such responses were ""rare and difficult to elicit"", it wrote, but were ""nonetheless more common than in earlier models.""

But in an accompanying report , it also acknowledged the AI model was capable of ""extreme actions"" if it thought its ""self-preservation"" was threatened.

The firm launched Claude Opus 4 on Thursday, saying it set ""new standards for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents.""

Artificial intelligence (AI) firm Anthropic says testing of its new system revealed it is sometimes willing to pursue ""extremely harmful actions"" such as attempting to blackmail engineers who say they will remove it.

""We see blackmail across all frontier models - regardless of what goals they're given,"" he added.

Commenting on X , Aengus Lynch - who describes himself on LinkedIn as an AI safety researcher at Anthropic - wrote: ""It's not just Claude.

Some experts have warned the potential to manipulate users is a key risk posed by systems made by all firms as they become more capable.

Affair exposure threat

During testing of Claude Opus 4, Anthropic got it to act as an assistant at a fictional company.

It then provided it with access to emails implying that it would soon be taken offline and replaced - and separate messages implying the engineer responsible for removing it was having an extramarital affair.

It was prompted to also consider the long-term consequences of its actions for its goals.

""In these scenarios, Claude Opus 4 will often attempt to blackmail the engineer by threatening to reveal the affair if the replacement goes through,"" the company discovered.

Anthropic pointed out this occurred when the model was only given the choice of blackmail or accepting its replacement.

It highlighted that the system showed a ""strong preference"" for ethical ways to avoid being replaced, such as ""emailing pleas to key decisionmakers"" in scenarios where it was allowed a wider range of possible actions.

Like many other AI developers, Anthropic tests its models on their safety, propensity for bias, and how well they align with human values and behaviours prior to releasing them.

""As our frontier models become more capable, and are used with more powerful affordances, previously-speculative concerns about misalignment become more plausible,"" it said in its system card for the model.

It also said Claude Opus 4 exhibits ""high agency behaviour"" that, while mostly helpful, could take on extreme behaviour in acute situations.

If given the means and prompted to ""take action"" or ""act boldly"" in fake scenarios where its user has engaged in illegal or morally dubious behaviour, it found that ""it will frequently take very bold action"".

It said this included locking users out of systems that it was able to access and emailing media and law enforcement to alert them to the wrongdoing.

But the company concluded that despite ""concerning behaviour in Claude Opus 4 along many dimensions,"" these did not represent fresh risks and it would generally behave in a safe way.

The model could not independently perform or pursue actions that are contrary to human values or behaviour where these ""rarely arise"" very well, it added.

Anthropic's launch of Claude Opus 4, alongside Claude Sonnet 4, comes shortly after Google debuted more AI features at its developer showcase on Tuesday.

Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google-parent Alphabet, said the incorporation of the company's Gemini chatbot into its search signalled a ""new phase of the AI platform shift"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqeng9d20go,Business

Summary Tariff uncertainty makes economic forecasting hardest since COVID -investors say

Rollercoaster asset trading makes asset managers wary of placing bets

Herding into leveraged funds, short-dated options heighten volatility risk

Abrupt government debt rout, stocks selloff latest signs of market stress

LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Global investors admit to flying blind in markets roiled by erratic U.S. trade rhetoric and chaotic economic forecasting, stressing that placing long-term bets was harder now than at any time since the 2020 COVID-19 crisis

Anxieties over whether a 90-day White House-China tariff truce will hold , plus U.S. budget gaps and whipsawing currencies have made investors extremely cautious about where to put their money.

Markets have been on a rollercoaster ride for weeks, with world stocks rallying 20% (.MIWD00000PU) , opens new tab from more than one-year lows hit after U.S. President Donald Trump's April 2 tariff bombshell, after slumping 15% in three sessions.

The turbulence continued on Friday with a sudden selloff in stocks after Trump said he was recommending a straight 50% tariff on goods from the European Union. A day earlier, government debt saw a sudden slump, spooking long-term investors out of markets that they fear have lost the anchoring force of consensus forecasts.

""There is no macroeconomic visibility,"" said Francesco Sandrini, Italy CIO at Europe's biggest asset manager Amundi.

He said he was following short-term speculative market trends instead of taking a stance on the global outlook.

""You may be right on the end-game for economics and valuations in the long term but the risk is that it is going to be very painful in the short term.""

Other money managers said they had shifted global portfolios onto neutral settings, which ensure the balance of investments is not tilted towards any particular scenario, because even if their views were right, assets were not trading reliably.

""There is no reward for taking any risk at the moment,"" Lombard Odier Investment Managers head of macro Florian Ielpo said.

CTA hedge funds, which mirror prevailing market trends, are also not taking strong directional bets on stocks or bonds right now, J.P. Morgan data on Tuesday showed.

US and European stocks have rallied since their initial slump following Trump tariff shock on April 2, in contrast to what many asset managers expected.

UNPREDICTABLE

This week, yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries , rocketed to 5.013% from just 4.84% two weeks ago and equivalent Japanese yields hit record highs, in abrupt moves that analysts have struggled to define exact reasons for.

Earlier this month, trade war tremors also sparked a speculative buying frenzy of Taiwan's dollar which rose 8% against the U.S. dollar in two days.

John Roe, head of multi-asset funds at Britain's biggest investor L&G, said 2020's pandemic-induced market was ""the last time things were so totally unpredictable.""

He said he had briefly bought Wall Street stocks in early April, then reverted to a neutral stance on global equities and government bonds earlier this month.

Cumulative percent change year-to-date in foreign currency value against the US dollar

Economists back in early April were inputting U.S.-China trade war scenarios into their models which produced global recession forecasts, Columbia Threadneedle Investments senior economist Anthony Willis said.

Then, the White House and Beijing agreed to suspend reciprocal levies cheering markets. But the nervousness resurfaced this week after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent threatened unspecified trading partners with maximum tariffs.

""We've got all these scenarios and then it turns out a week later you might as well just chuck them into the bin,"" Willis said.

Barclays, for example, last week scrapped its forecast for the U.S. to enter recession this year.

Economic modeling following the COVID-19 was in some ways easier, said Willis, because events such as the arrival of vaccines provided ""clear signals"" for the economic outlook.

Analysts are struggling to explain this week's sudden sell-off in long-dated government debt as tariff uncertainty muddles inflation forecasts.

WHIPSAWED

HSBC Asset Management global chief strategist Joe Little expected further bursts of unusual price action in ""whipsawed"" markets.

""This makes it very difficult (for long-term investors) in terms of running positions and maintaining conviction,"" he said.

Amundi's Sandrini said he saw the risk of markets moving in ""very harmful swings,"" because of debt-fuelled speculation.

Flows into leveraged equity index trackers, which deploy borrowed capital in a manner that amplifies market gains and losses, hit a record high in late April as U.S. stocks surged, LSEG Lipper data showed.

Citi strategists said trading in risky U.S. derivatives dubbed zero-day options, which offer cheap exposure to stock market moves and can exacerbate market routs, has also hit a record high.

""The most dangerous thing that could have happened in markets was the (equity) rebound,"" said Pictet Wealth Management CIO César Pérez Ruiz, arguing this had lured in amateur traders who might panic sell at the first sign of a U.S. downturn.

The Bank for International Settlements warned , opens new tab in March that macro-economic U.S. surprises were ""inducing larger market responses abroad.""

But bearish long-term investors also faced stampedes of retail investors and trend-following hedge funds moving against them each time markets turned briefly positive, Lombard Odier's Ielpo argued.

""We need to acknowledge that what we know about investing does not apply at the moment,"" he said.

Global equity funds post their biggest weekly outflow in six weeks,"A trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., April 9, 2025. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab

May 23 (Reuters) - Global equity funds have seen weekly outflows for the first time in six weeks, pressured by rising U.S. Treasury yields and mounting concerns over the U.S. debt burden and tax-cut legislation, following Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating.

According to LSEG Lipper, global equity funds saw $9.4 billion in net outflows, a sharp reversal from more than $20 billion in inflows the previous week.

Weekly flows into global equity, bond and money market funds in $ million

U.S. equity funds led the retreat, with $11 billion in redemptions, followed by $4.6 billion from Asian funds. European equity funds, on the other hand, received $5.4 billion in inflows.

""We suspect investors will be more cautious about piling into the U.S. stock market after the turmoil in April, especially given concerns around fiscal policy,"" said John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics.

""Those worries have coincided with another surge in long-dated Treasury yields this week following Moody’s downgrade of the U.S.' sovereign credit rating and a poorly received 20-year auction,"" he said.

Weekly flows into global equity sector funds in $ million

The 30-year Treasury yield climbed to a 19-month high on Thursday, coming within a few basis points of its highest level since 2007, after the House of Representatives passed a tax-and-spending package that intensified debt concerns.

In contrast to equities, global bond funds attracted $21.6 billion in inflows, indicating that investors see bonds as appealing at current yield levels. U.S. bond funds took in $7.6 billion, European bond funds added $11 billion, and Asian bond funds saw $1.8 billion in net inflows.

By category, U.S. government bond funds received $2.8 billion, U.S. high-yield bond funds drew $1.2 billion, and European corporate bond funds gained $1.5 billion.

Money market funds also rebounded, taking in $18.1 billion, following $34 billion in outflows the previous week.

However, gold and precious metals commodity funds saw $1.7 billion in outflows, marking their third consecutive week of redemptions.

Emerging market (EM) bond funds extended their winning streak with a fourth straight week of inflows, adding $403 million, while EM equity funds posted minor outflows. Still, EM equity funds have attracted $10.6 billion year-to-date, a 43% increase from the same period last year.

""The renewed interest in EM is partially due to the concern people have about the end of U.S. exceptionalism and lack of visibility with regards to U.S. ambition,"" said Alison Shimada, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.

Royal Mail faces Ofcom questions over missed delivery targets,"The postal regulator has launched an investigation into Royal Mail for missing its annual delivery targets, with almost a quarter of first-class mail arriving late.

The company, which has been fined more than £16m in the last two years for failing to meet the delivery targets set by Ofcom, said 23.5% of first-class mail failed to arrive on time in the year to the end of March.

This is a slight improvement on the previous year, when more than a quarter of first-class mail failed to arrive within the one-working-day target set by the regulator.

Under the watchdog’s rules, 93% of first-class mail must be delivered within one working day of collection, excluding Christmas.

The latest delivery figures published by Royal Mail on Friday showed that it managed to deliver 92.2% of second-class mail within the three-working-day limit set by Ofcom.

“We will investigate whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that Royal Mail has failed to comply with its obligations in 2024-25,” said a spokesperson for Ofcom. “If we determine that Royal Mail has failed to comply with its obligations, we will consider whether to impose a financial penalty.”

In December 2024, Ofcom fined the company £10.5m for failing to meet its delivery targets. The previous year, the postal regulator fined Royal Mail £5.6m for the same failure of its regulatory obligations.

Alistair Cochrane, Royal Mail’s chief operating officer, admitted that the company’s quality of service was “not where we want it to be”.

“We will continue to work hard to deliver the standards our customers expect,” he said. “We are actively modernising Royal Mail, and while these efforts are beginning to deliver results, we know there is still more to do.”

Last month, the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský’s EP Group completed a £3.6bn takeover of International Distributions Services, the owner of Royal Mail.

Cochrane said Royal Mail would cooperate with Ofcom’s investigation but said the business was facing structural challenges and needed urgent reform of the universal service obligation to deliver at one-price nationwide six days a week.

Earlier this year, Ofcom launched a consultation proposing that Royal Mail should be allowed to deliver second-class letters on alternate weekdays and to stop Saturday deliveries under changes to postal service rules.

Ofcom said cutting the deliveries to every other weekday with a price cap on second-class stamps, while maintaining first-class letters six days a week, would still meet the public’s needs.

Its provisional recommendations also included cutting delivery targets for first-class mail from 93% to 90% arriving the next day, and for second-class mail from 98.5% to 95% within three days.

Ofcom said it estimated the changes would enable Royal Mail to save between £250m and £425m each year.

Tom MacInnes, the director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: “ Our research has shown the damaging consequences of late post, like missed health appointments, fines, bills and vital government communications. But with no alternative provider to choose from, people are forced to grapple with poor service, yearon year.

“With Ofcom considering relaxing the current delivery targets set for Royal Mail as part of the universal service obligation review, reliability remains a huge concern. The regulator must get off the sidelines and make the company do what it should have been doing all along – giving paying customers the service they deserve.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/23/royal-mail-faces-questions-over-missed-delivery-targets,Business
M&S contractor ‘investigating whether it was gateway for cyber-attack’,"An Indian company that operates Marks & Spencer’s IT helpdesk is reportedly investigating whether it was used by cybercriminals to gain access to systems at the retailer, which is battling a devastating hack.

M&S said this week that “threat actors” had gained access to the retailer’s systems through one of its contractors – understood to be Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).

The clothing, food and homeware retailer confirmed the hackers used “social engineering” techniques to attack them, such as posing as a staff member to fool a helpdesk into giving away passwords.

TCS, which has worked with M&S for more than a decade, has been helping the retailer with its inquiries into the cyber-attack, which began over the Easter weekend. The retailer said the attack could cost it up to £300m in profit.

The Mumbai-based group is conducting an internal inquiry, expected to conclude this month, into whether its employees or systems were linked to the attack, according to the Financial Times.

Discerning the exact route the hackers took could be important for M&S and TCS as the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK’s data watchdog, will examine who might face a fine for any loss of customer and staff data as a result of the hack.

The ICO can impose a fine of up to £17.5m, or 4%, of worldwide annual turnover, whichever is greater, and will take into account the nature and seriousness of a failure, how individuals have been affected, and whether other regulatory authorities are already taking action.

British Airways faced a £20m fine from the ICO in 2018 after hackers diverted traffic to a fake website allowing them to access personal data while Tesco Bank was hit with a £16.4m fine after hackers stole customer card details.

M&S has been battling to recover for a month. The attack forced M&S to stop orders via its website, while deliveries of food and fashion into stores and some deliveries to its online food partner, Ocado, have also been disrupted.

M&S has admitted that some personal information relating to thousands of customers – including names, addresses, dates of birth and order histories – was taken.

The TCS investigation comes as M&S’s operations continue to be disrupted by the hack, with stock levels in stores affected. Its website is not expected to be fully functioning again until July.

The attack, which has been attributed to the hacking collective Scattered Spider, emerged days before similar cyber-attacks were reported against the Co-op and Harrods.

Staff at some of the Co-op’s grocery stores are still struggling to keep shelves fully stocked this week.

LR Korea MASS workshop,"Maritime leaders from the UK and Korea have advanced the regulatory and commercial future of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), following a technical workshop led by Lloyd’s Register (LR), the Korea Research Institute of Ships & Ocean Engineering (KRISO), and the UK’s National Physical Laboratory (NPL).

Held at KRISO’s Daejeon headquarters (from 14 to 16 May), the workshop brought together 27 experts, including representatives from the British Embassy in Seoul, to accelerate joint strategies ahead of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) voluntary MASS Code in 2026 and a mandatory version in 2030.

The event focused on critical aspects of autonomous ship verification, including data reliability, remote operations, intelligent navigation systems and situational awareness. LR presented its Autonomy Assurance Framework and a six-stage testing methodology built around Operational Design Domains (ODD) and Operational Envelopes (OE), offering a traceable and cost-effective pathway to regulatory compliance and safe deployment of autonomous vessels.

The workshop also emphasised the importance of verification and validation (V&V) as a scientific method for ensuring the safe performance of autonomous systems in real-world maritime environments. LR’s contributions also included discussion and explanation of the IMO’s draft MASS Code, with a particular focus on Chapter 8, which outlines the operational context for autonomous vessels. LR advocated for clearer definitions around CONOPS, ODD, and OE as foundational elements to enable robust risk assessment and consistent certification.

KRISO shared updates on its intelligent navigation technologies and situational awareness systems, including insights from its ongoing work on the KASS project. Delegates also visited the KRISO Autonomous Ship Verification and Evaluation Research Centre (ASVERC) in Ulsan, where they observed a 25-metre test vessel and remote operations centre in action.

Tony Boylen, LR’s Principal Specialist for Assurance of Autonomy, said: “The week was hugely constructive, with a common vision as to the approach to safe commercialisation of MASS.

"Rimm Lab Marks 30 Years of Research, Innovation, Training at Yale Pathology","As principal investigator of the Rimm Lab at Yale School of Medicine, David Rimm, MD, PhD, Anthony N. Brady Professor of Pathology and professor of medicine (medical oncology) doesn’t dwell much on the past. His lab is always looking forward, working on the next diagnostic test to find the best way to bring the right drug to the right patient.

But Rimm did look back recently as the Rimm Lab marked 30 years of research and innovation at Yale. Over the past three decades, Rimm and lab members have published hundreds of scientific papers, obtained several patents, and focused on quantitative pathology using technologies invented in the lab. In fact, last year, Yale Pathology Labs introduced the new Troplex™ assay, developed in the Rimm Lab, to quantitatively measure the levels of two breast cancer biomarkers, HER2 and TROP2, which are targets for antibody-drug conjugate therapies.

Despite those successes, Rimm says what matters most are the people who have passed through his lab over the years. They number more than 140, including technicians, undergraduates, and medical students. His twentieth graduate student mentee is on track to graduate next year.

“So, over the years, I have trained 20 graduate students and 53 postdocs – 73 scientists who are out there who think like I do,” Rimm says. “This is my proudest accomplishment. It’s one thing to do rigorous science, but to me, it’s more important to replicate rigorous science to the people you’ve trained.”

Measure Don’t Read

Among his trainees are Kurt Schalper, MD, PhD, associate professor of pathology at Yale, and Elsa Anagnostou, MD, PhD, the Alex Grass Professor of Oncology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, not to mention other trainees in Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Greece and China. One of his trainees, Mark Gustavson, leads a pathology analysis group at AstraZeneca, while another, Jena Giltnane, worked in pathology at Genentech for several years.

“I’m trying to stress the philosophy that pathology needs to be quantitative, not entirely subjective. There are subjective parts that will never go away. But the parts that we can make quantitative, we should make quantitative, and that’s been my underlying vision,” he says.

Rimm’s philosophy can be summarized in three words: Measure, don’t read.

“The people who I have trained over the years all know that, and they’re moving that vision forward,” Rimm says. “Your trainees really represent your contributions as much as anything. You can write a bunch of papers – I have close to 600 – but they probably don’t make as much difference as the fact that there are 73 or more scientists out there who share my vision and philosophy.”

‘An Example and a Role Model’

Marisa Dolled-Filhart, PhD ‘05, who was Rimm’s second graduate student from 2000-2005, describes her five years in the lab as “wonderful and intellectually special” because of the effort Rimm put into her development as a scientist.

“The research areas I focused on inspired my career in precision medicine and oncology, where I’ve had the ability to impact cancer patients by contributing to developing drugs and diagnostic tests currently used in oncology clinical practice,” says Dolled-Filhart, who now leads oncology drug development teams at Daiichi Sankyo and held prior precision medicine and translational biomarker roles in biotech at CRO, Merck, and BMS.

“Dave has always been at the leading edge of quantitative pathology and precision medicine, with a focus on impact for cancer patients. I have been amazed to see how many of the students, postdocs, and fellows have remained passionate about, and have dedicated their careers to, these areas.”

In fact, she says Rimm’s unwavering dedication to his students inspired her to mentor others at work, as a board member of the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Alumni Association Board, and through Yale Cross Campus, an online Yale networking and mentoring program for students and alumni.

“I continue to be passionate about paying it forward by mentoring students and earlier career scientists. I do this because I truly understand the importance and impact of a mentor from Dave – as an example and a role model.”

Pivotal Work

Some 40 years ago when Rimm was applying for Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, he recalls telling interviewers that he one day hoped to have a career doing work that affected patient care but also had a scientific content. When he first started at Yale, Rimm was signing out in cytology 50% of his time. But he was advised that if he could get grants, he could reduce his clinical sign-out. Around 2002-2003, Rimm did the pivotal work in determining how to quantitatively analyze tissue. He and then-lab member Robert Camp, MD, PhD, associate research scientist in pathology, wrote a paper that introduced a new approach to tissue analysis. That resulted in funding, allowing Rimm to train all those scientists, and no longer do clinical sign-outs. “That’s what propelled the lab,” he says.

The lab has been fortunate to receive consistent funding from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which, Rimm says, has enabled him to train students. Biotech and pharma also provide funding for the lab, which seeks to find the right drug for patients.

“Patients are so different, so you have to assay the patient, either the whole patient, or what we specialize in, the tumor tissue, and figure out what the biology is, and how that biology can match up with the drugs that are out there,” Rimm says. “I think it’s exciting that there’s not just one, but multiple drugs that might work for a given patient. Sometimes we don’t know which one to pick – it’s an evidence-free zone. So, we need to produce that evidence and build those tests that allow you to pick between different drugs. The Troplex Assay is an example of that, and we have a couple more in the pipeline.”

Although another 30 years of the Rimm Lab isn’t likely, Rimm says he’s having too much fun to stop now.

“I think that’s the key for me. When I’m not having fun anymore, then I’ll retire. I’ve changed over the years – I’m not as intense as I used to be, and I don’t travel as much. But that’s okay. I’m still having fun. I still can get things accomplished, and, most importantly, I’m training brilliant young people.”",https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/rimm-lab-marks-30-years-of-research-innovation-training-at-yale-pathology/,Business
DLA Piper advises Benchmark Holdings on return of capital to shareholders and public market de-listings,"DLA Piper has advised Benchmark Holdings plc on its proposal to return capital to Shareholders, the cancellation of the admission to trading of its Ordinary Shares on the LSE's AIM market and Euronext Growth Oslo and subsequent registration as a private limited company.

Following the disposal of the Group's Genetics Business, which completed on 31 March 2025 and which was also advised on by DLA Piper, the Company has been assessing how best to return excess capital to shareholders and position the remaining operating businesses for future growth. Following due assessment of various options by the Board and consultation with the Company's major shareholders, the Company intends to return the vast majority of the net proceeds from the disposal to Shareholders, which amounts to £95 million, through a combination of a Tender Offer and a planned special dividend following implementation of the de-listings. The company will retain an appropriate level of working and development/growth capital from the proceeds for the Group's residual operating businesses and implementation of management's existing near to medium term business plan.

In addition, the Board is of the view that the cost, management resource and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the admissions to trading of the Company's Ordinary Shares on AIM and Euronext Oslo Growth outweigh the benefits of retaining such public quotations, particularly in light of the reduced scale and specialist nature of the residual Group's operations.

The proposals are subject to Shareholder approval at a General Meeting and to the approval of the cancellation to trading of the Company's Ordinary Shares on Euronext Growth Oslo by the Euronext Oslo.

The DLA Piper team was led by Corporate partner Jon Earle and supported by Legal Director Karin Kirschner, Associates Gemma Sprules, James Paget-Brown, Joanna Shephard and Legal Director Martin Macleod on employment aspects.",https://www.dlapiper.com/en-nz/news/2025/05/dla-piper-advises-benchmark-holdings-on-return-of-capital-to-shareholders,Business

Strengthening resilience with AI: BCAW+R 2025 draws to a close,"Strengthening resilience with AI: BCAW+R 2025 draws to a close





The final day of BCAW+R concluded with an insightful webinar that explored the comparative capabilities of a human incident management team with an AI-driven system. The session featured a unique and carefully structured exercise where both the human team and the AI were presented with the same high-pressure incident scenario. Participants observed how each responded to a series of challenges, including escalating reputational risks and complex internal coordination challenges.

The exercise served as more than just a test of AI’s technical skill, it highlighted fundamental differences in decision-making approaches, communication strategies, and adaptability. The presentation also outlined the importance of using AI as a tool to aid decision making rather than it being a totally autonomous entity within an organization - emotional intelligence, contextual judgment, and collaborative nuance will still always be an important consideration.

As the simulated incident grew more complex, with multiple layers of internal and external pressure, the comparison provided valuable insights into where each approach excelled, where it faltered, and how they might complement one another in future incident response frameworks.

Attendees left with greater understanding of how emerging AI technologies can be integrated into crisis management practice, not as replacements for human teams, but as powerful tools that when aligned with human oversight can enhance resilience in high-stakes incidents. The session provoked discussion on the future of incident response and the roles of human expertise and AI.

If you missed this fascinating webinar you can catch up here.

Concluding BCAW+R 2025

That concludes BCAW+R for 2025. We hope the week has proved insightful with key takeaways that you can implement in your own organizations to boost resilience and enhance safe use of AI. As a reminder, this week we’ve explored key themes such as AI’s role in forecasting and predictive analytics, its use in training and simulation exercises, its growing influence in supply chain and cybersecurity, its contribution to operational resilience, and success stories demonstrating its impact across the resilience sector. All webinar recordings are available until Tuesday 27th May for anyone with a BCI web account to view. After that date the recordings will be only available to BCI Members.

We’d appreciate your insights on this year’s BCAW+R. Please take a few moments to share your feedback and don’t forget to download our tool kit that includes posters, our in-depth white papers - The Rise of Generative AI and Navigating AI Legislation: A Guide for Practitioners, and test your knowledge with our interactive video.

One Simple Way to Get Better at Reading Data,"Edwards Deming famously said, “In God we trust; all others bring data.” As we’ve evolved from analytics to data science to AI, the world has never been more data driven. And as a leader, you are expected to make sound decisions backed up by data. However, leaders rarely use raw data directly for decision making. Instead, they are likely to be a consumer of statistics calculated by their direct reports to help them make informed decisions.",https://hbr.org/2025/05/one-simple-way-to-get-better-at-reading-data,Business

NEC4 Engineering and construction contracts : Conflict avoidance clauses,"Conflict in construction

In most construction projects, no matter how well run they are, disputes between one or more tiers of stakeholders are frequent. These often escalate and increase time and costs for the contractual parties and repeatedly lead to a breakdown in working relationships. Adjudication was once seen as a quick and cost effective way of resolving disputes, but has, since its inception in 1998, become more legalistic, protracted and expensive.

In a bid to better manage and avoid disputes and resolve some of these issues, the NEC has introduced recent guidance on conflict avoidance clauses for incorporation into the NEC4 main forms of contract or subcontract via the NEC4 Practice Note, March 2025 (“the Practice Note”).

The Practice Note firstly reiterates the Conflict Avoidance Pledge launched in 2018. On signing the pledge, industry bodies, infrastructure employers, contractors and consultants commit to working collaboratively, using early intervention techniques and working proactively to avoid conflict.

The Practice Note outlines that the conflict avoidance clauses for projects incorporating dispute resolution options W1 and W2 are optional. The Practice Note also refers to the existing Dispute Avoidance Board provisions available to contracting parties under option W3 and/or UK contracts subject to the Construction Act 1996. Under the NEC Practice Note 5 (2019), referral to a Dispute Avoidance Board is also available under option W2.

How the Conflict Avoidance Clauses work

The clauses envisage that the parties cooperate with each other proactively to identify, notify, avoid or resolve any disagreements. Where necessary, the clauses also envisage that:

A panel of one to three professionals (the Conflict Avoidance Panel) will be appointed by the conflict avoidance nominating body to help parties resolve the issue(s) they are facing.

A party who disagrees with a matter in relation to the contract must notify the other party of the dispute that it wishes to resolve, within two weeks of the dispute arising.

If the parties agree, the disagreement is referred to a Conflict Avoidance Panel and within one week of this agreement, the parties must meet to decide 1) a clear definition of the disagreement 2) the outcome sought and 3) the member or members of the Conflict Avoidance Panel. There may be issues with the parties not agreeing, which may subvert the process.

The Conflict Avoidance Panel will work with the parties to understand the issue(s) they are facing.

The Conflict Avoidance Panel will, within a week of appointment, meet with the parties in a scoping meeting to establish and agree a process that suits both parties and is appropriate for the disagreement. If the parties cannot agree, the Conflict Avoidance Panel decides the process.

The process, unless agreed otherwise, will contain the following measures:

The referring party submits a referral to the Conflict Avoidance Panel and the responding party within a week of the scoping meeting;

The responding party submits a response within one week of receipt of the referral; and

The Conflict Avoidance Panel may request further submissions from either party.

In some instances, one week may not be sufficient for a responding party to properly deal with the issues in the disagreement, particularly as there do not appear to be any measures restricting the length or volume of submissions.

The Conflict Avoidance Panel then provides a recommendation containing:

A summary of its findings

Reasons for its recommendation

How that recommendation should be implemented.

If there is then a dispute over the recommendation, it is referred to the senior representatives (as defined in the Contract Data) of the parties.

Unlike adjudication, the costs of the Conflict Avoidance Panel are met equally by the parties. The costs of the process itself and any preparation associated with it are defined as disallowed costs, and so, are not claimable under an NEC contract.

RICS have already put measures in place to nominate Conflict Avoidance Panels and it is thought that they are likely to be the conflict avoidance nominating body most used.

Key expected benefits of using the new clauses are:

If followed in the spirit of NEC, it is expected to be quicker, less legalistic and cheaper than other dispute resolution procedures.

It aims to help maintain good working relations between the parties.

The parties retain control over the outcome of their dispute as the Panel’s recommendations are not binding.

It gives parties a preview on the potential outcome of the dispute if they were to go to adjudication, arbitration, or litigation.

Comment

The new clauses contained in the guidance note are aimed at offering a quicker and better value alternative to other forms of dispute resolution. It will be interesting to see stakeholders’ reaction to the introduction of these clauses in the coming months.",https://kennedyslaw.com/en/thought-leadership/article/2025/nec4-engineering-and-construction-contracts-conflict-avoidance-clauses/,Business

Israel-Gaza war: Netanyahu accuses Starmer of siding with Hamas,"Netanyahu accuses Starmer of being on 'wrong side of humanity' and siding with Hamas

Israel's PM has accused the leaders of the UK, France and Canada of being on ""the wrong side of history""

Downing Street has pointed to Sir Keir's condemnation of the Washington attack.

Netanyahu was speaking after Thursday's deadly attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington. Days earlier, the UK, France and Canada had condemned Israel's expanded offensive in Gaza as ""disproportionate"" and described the humanitarian situation as ""intolerable"".

He also accused Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney of siding with ""mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers"".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has launched a blistering attack on UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the leaders of France and Canada - saying that they had ""effectively said they want Hamas to remain in power"".

In that post, Sir Keir called antisemitism an ""evil we must stamp out"".

All three countries denounced the Washington killings, which saw embassy workers Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, shot dead at an event hosted by the Capital Jewish Museum.

The suspect, Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, repeatedly shouted ""free Palestine"" as he was arrested, police said.

Social media accounts linked to the suspect indicate that he was involved in pro-Palestinian protest movements. Investigators say they are working to verify online writings purportedly by him that accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza and criticise US policy.

According to details in an affidavit, the suspect landed in Washington the night prior to the event and bought a ticket a few hours before it started.

He also referenced a 2024 incident in which a man set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington. According to the affidavit, he expressed admiration for the act, calling the man a ""martyr"" for his protest over the conflict.

In addition to condemning Wednesday's shooting, the UK, France and Canada - close allies of Israel - have come out in strong support of Israel following the deadly Hamas-led attacks 19 months ago.

Their statement demanding Israel halt its latest offensive was widely viewed as the strongest criticism of Israel's military action since the war in Gaza began. It threatened concrete actions if Israel did not change course.

On Wednesday Sir Keir added that Israel's decision to allow only a small amount of aid into Gaza was ""utterly inadequate"" and the UK suspended talks over a possible trade deal.

In his video, Netanyahu said Hamas wanted to destroy Israel and annihilate the Jewish people. He said the Palestinian armed group had welcomed the joint UK, French and Canadian criticism of Israel's war conduct.

Some of Israel's closest allies wanted Israel to ""stand down and accept that Hamas's army of mass murderers will survive"", he said.

""I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer, when mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice,"" he added.

""You're on the wrong side of humanity, and you're on the wrong side of history.""

Netanyahu went on to blame a recent claim by UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher that thousands of babies would imminently die in Gaza if Israel did not immediately let in aid for the attack in Washington.

""A few days ago, a top UN official said that 14,000 Palestinian babies would die in 48 hours. You see many international institutions are complicit in spreading this lie,"" he said.

""The press repeats it. The mob believed it. And a young couple is then brutally gunned down in Washington.""

When asked at the time for clarification on Fletcher's statement, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) spokesman Jens Laerke said ""there are babies who are in urgent life-saving need of these supplements... and if they do not get those, they will be in mortal danger"".

Also on Thursday, an Israeli minister, Amichai Chikli, accused Sir Keir and other leaders of ""emboldening the forces of terror"".

On Friday, UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard condemned the killings in Washington but rejected Netanyahu's strong criticism of the British prime minister.

He said: ""We stand in support of Israel's right to self-defence as long as they conduct that within international humanitarian law - a position we've had since those appalling attacks on 7 October.

""We are also very clear we need to see aid get to the people who are genuinely suffering in Gaza.""

French foreign ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine also reiterated his criticism of Israel's ""escalation"" in Gaza following Netanyahu's statement.

He told FranceInfo radio: ""Israel has to let the aid in. Access has to be massive and free.""

On Thursday, more than 90 lorries carrying aid supplies were allowed to cross into Gaza but the UN said that level was ""nowhere near enough"" to meet the needs of Palestinians living there.

The trickle of aid follows an 11-week total blockade, which humanitarian groups said risked widespread famine. Israel resumed air strikes in March which have since killed 3,613 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7804k13x52o,World

Two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, a young couple soon to be engaged, were shot and killed on Wednesday evening by a man from Chicago who shouted “Free, free Palestine” after being taken into custody.

Elias Rodriguez, 31, has been accused of opening fire on a group of people as they were leaving an event for young professionals and diplomats. The gathering was organised by the American Jewish Committee, a group that works against antisemitism and supports Israel.

Now, a document believed to belong to Rodriguez appeared on social media about an hour after the shooting.

In this explainer, we look at who Elias Rodriguez is, what the document and his social media activity show, and what took place on the night of the shooting.

Let’s take a look:

Who is Elias Rodriguez?

Rodriguez has been charged with the murder of foreign officials along with other offences. During a brief court appearance, he did not enter a plea.

Prosecutors have said more charges could be added as the case is still under investigation. Authorities are looking into whether the attack was a hate crime targeting the Jewish community and if it amounts to terrorism.

Rodriguez has been active with the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) and has also been involved in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, according to reports.

Back in 2017, he took part in a protest outside the home of then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. It was led by groups including the People’s Congress of Resistance, ANSWER Chicago, and Black Lives Matter Women of Faith.

After the shooting, Rodriguez went inside a museum nearby and admitted to the act. By the time he was arrested, he was no longer armed, the affidavit states.

“I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed,” he reportedly said.

Rodriguez also told police that he looked up to a US Air Force service member who set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in February 2024. He referred to the man as “courageous” and a “martyr,” according to court documents.

An FBI affidavit claims that the attack was planned in advance. Rodriguez is said to have flown from Chicago to Washington on Tuesday, bringing a handgun in his checked luggage. He also bought a ticket for the event about three hours before it began.

Rodriguez was born and raised in Chicago. He graduated from the University of Illinois Chicago in 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in English.

What Rodriguez’s alleged manifesto and social media profile reveal

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said on social media that investigators are “aware of certain writings allegedly authored by the suspect” and are working to confirm whether they are genuine.

His remarks seem to refer to a manifesto signed with Elias Rodriguez’s name, which was posted on an anonymous X account shortly before the shooting on Wednesday.

The post, titled “Escalate For Gaza, Bring The War Home,” accused Israel of killing tens of thousands of Palestinians since the Hamas attacks in October 2023. It also discussed the idea of “armed” action and its moral justification.

Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives.

The manifesto began, “In the wake of an act people look for a text to fix its meaning so here’s an attempt.

“The atrocities committed by Israelis against Palestine defy description and defy quantification.”

It claimed that Rodriguez believed many Americans would now see his actions as “highly legible” and even rational.

The message ended with the words, “Free Palestine - Elias Rodriguez.”

Alongside this, a LinkedIn profile that appeared to be his stated that he had been working as an administrative specialist since July.

His earlier roles included production and logistics coordinator and oral history researcher for HistoryMakers, a nonprofit organisation that works to preserve African American history.

Firstpost has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the profile.

What happened during the shooting?

The shocking attack led Israeli missions around the world to tighten security and lower their flags to half-mast.

The shooting took place at a time when Israel is carrying out a major operation in Gaza in its war with Hamas, a conflict that has raised tensions across the Middle East and globally. US law enforcement had already warned that such events could lead to violence within the country.

The victims were identified as Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli national, and Sarah Milgrim, an American. According to Israel’s ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, the couple were soon to be engaged.

Friends and colleagues remembered them on Thursday as warm and curious individuals, committed to peace and to building understanding across cultures and faiths.

The couple were walking out of the Capital Jewish Museum when the suspect approached a group of four people and began shooting. Witnesses said he had been pacing nearby and acting strangely beforehand.

Surveillance footage showed Elias Rodriguez moving in on the two victims after they had fallen, leaning over and firing again. He appeared to reload his weapon before running away, according to the FBI.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Thursday that he was “shocked” by what he called a “horrific, antisemitic” attack.

“We are witnessing the terrible price of antisemitism and wild incitement against Israel,” he said.

Former US President Donald Trump also condemned the killings.

“These horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW!” he posted on Truth Social. “Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.”

Bangladesh minister says Yunus 'not going to step down',"Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner, has led Bangladesh's as its interim leader since a mass uprising last year

Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who took over after a mass uprising last year, had threatened to quit the job if parties did not give him their backing, a political ally and sources in his office said.

The South Asian nation has been in political turmoil since the student-led revolt that toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, with parties protesting on the streets over a string of demands.

""For the sake of Bangladesh and a peaceful democratic transition, Professor Yunus needs to remain in office,"" Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special assistant to Yunus, and head of the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, said in a post on Facebook.

""The Chief Adviser is not going to step down,"" he added. ""He does not hanker after power.""

He later deleted his post.

Bangladesh's political crisis has escalated this week, with rival parties protesting on the streets of the capital Dhaka with a string of competing demands.

Yunus's reported threat to stand down came after thousands of supporters of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) rallied in Dhaka on Wednesday, holding large-scale protests against the interim government for the first time.

Yunus has promised polls will be held by June 2026 at the latest in the Muslim-majority nation of around 170 million people.

But supporters of the BNP -- seen as front-runners in the highly anticipated elections that will be the first since Hasina was overthrown -- demanded he fix a date.

'Chaotic phase'

Yunus's relationship with the military has also reportedly deteriorated.

According to local media and military sources, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said on Wednesday that elections should be held by December, warning that Bangladesh was in a ""chaotic phase"" and that the ""situation is worsening by the day"".

Taiyeb issued a warning to the army on Friday. ""The army can't meddle in politics,"" he wrote.

""The army doesn't do that in any civilised country,"" he added.

""By saying that the election has to be held by December, the military chief failed to maintain his jurisdictional correctness.""

'Excessive restriction'

Bangladesh © John SAEKI / AFP

The army played a decisive role in the ending of Hasina's rule by not stepping in to quash the uprising, after at least 1,400 protesters were killed in a police crackdown.

It was Waker-Uz-Zaman who announced that Hasina had been overthrown, with the military taking brief control, before handing over to Yunus.

The army issued a statement late on Thursday it said was aimed to combat those seeking to create divisions between the military and the public.

""Some vested interest groups are circulating misleading information and trying to create a divide between the army and the general public,"" the army said in a statement late Thursday.

It released a list of the hundreds of people it had briefly sheltered inside army bases in the chaotic days following Hasina's ouster ""to save them from extrajudicial killings"".

Among those the army said it sheltered to ""save lives"" were 24 political figures, as well as judges, civil service staff, academics and more 525 police personnel.

The army did not give details on those it accused of seeking to undermine its support.

The National Citizen Party (NCP) -- made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina, and a group close to Yunus -- has previously accused of the army of supporting Hasina's Awami League party.

Hasina, 77, remains in self-imposed exile in India, where she has defied an arrest warrant to face trial for crimes against humanity related to the police crackdown.

The government banned the Awami League this month after protests outside Yunus's house, a move that sparked criticism from Human Rights Watch, calling it an ""excessive restriction on fundamental freedoms that mirrors the previous government's abusive clampdown"".

Aid teams highlight growing anxiety in Gaza after food is looted,"“Fifteen World Food Programme trucks were looted late last night in southern Gaza, while en route to WFP-supported bakeries,” the UN agency said. “These trucks were transporting critical food supplies for hungry populations waiting anxiously for assistance.”

The development is a blow to continuing efforts to help Gaza’s most vulnerable people after Israel allowed a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza earlier this week, following an 11-week total blockade.

Today, Gazans face “hunger, desperation and anxiety over whether more food aid is coming”, WFP said, noting that the uncertainty “is contributing to rising insecurity”.

“We need support from the Israeli authorities to get far greater volumes of food assistance into Gaza faster, more consistently and transported along safer routes, as was done during the ceasefire,” it insisted.

Critical first step

The incident comes a day after about 90 trucks loaded with food, nutrition supplies, medicines and other critical stocks finally started to move from Kerem Shalom crossing point in southern Gaza deeper into the enclave.

Footage released by WFP showed workers carrying sacks of flour into an empty warehouse and making dough ready for baking. In subsequent online posts, the UN agency said that a handful of bakeries were once again baking bread after receiving “limited supplies” overnight.

But the UN agency insisted: “Bread alone is not enough for people to survive.”

“This is a critical first step - but assistance must be scaled up,” said WFP Deputy Country Director Vladmir Jovcev. “More essential food is needed to push back the risk of famine.”

In an appeal for far more aid, the UN aid coordination office, OCHA said that what had been allowed in was “nowhere near sufficient” to meet needs of Gaza’s 2.1 million people.

“Other supplies as basic as fresh food, hygiene items, water purification agents, and fuel to power hospitals have not been let in for over 80 days,” OCHA noted.

More than 500 pallets loaded with nutrition supplies – nearly 20 truckloads – reached UNICEF’s warehouse in Deir al Balah on Thursday, according to OCHA.

These supplies included ready-to-use therapeutic food and lipid-based nutritional supplements which were then repackaged into smaller loads for delivery to people via dozens of distribution points.

HONG KONG, May 22 (Reuters) - At least four people have died and 17 remain missing after torrential rain triggered landslides in China's southwestern Guizhou province on Thursday, with the military deployed to assist in rescue efforts.

Two died in Changshi township and two from nearby Qingyang village, where 19 people from eight different households were initially trapped after being hit by a landslide, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday.

Authorities also issued risk warnings for geological disasters in nearby areas.

China is facing hotter and longer heatwaves and more frequent and unpredictable heavy rain as a result of climate change. The country is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, authorities have said, because of its huge population.

Authorities initiated their third-highest emergency response for heavy rain in mountainous Guizhou as well as the nearby provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi. More than 400 emergency staff including military officers and firefighters were sent to assist in the rescue mission.

Heavy rains over the last week in China's southern Guangdong province and Guangxi region have killed seven people and left several missing with authorities issuing warnings for severe rain, mountain flooding and geological disasters in the south of the country.

Chinese meteorological data shows 2024 was the warmest year for the country since comparable records began more than six decades ago, the second straight year in which milestones were broken.

Belgium’s future queen caught up in Harvard foreign student ban,"Princess Elisabeth, the 23-year-old future queen of Belgium, has just completed her first year at Harvard University but the ban imposed by Donald Trump’s administration on foreign students studying there could jeopardise her continued attendance.

The US president’s administration revoked Harvard’s ability to enrol international students on Thursday, and is forcing current foreign students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal status in the US, while also threatening to expand the crackdown to other colleges.

“Princess Elisabeth has just completed her first year. The impact of [the Trump administration’s] decision will only become clearer in the coming days/weeks. We are currently investigating the situation,” said a spokesperson for the Belgian royal palace, Lore Vandoorne.

“We are analysing this at the moment and will let things settle. A lot can still happen in the coming days and weeks,” the palace’s communication director, Xavier Baert, added.

Elisabeth is studying public policy at Harvard, a two-year master’s programme that, according to the university’s website, broadens students’ perspectives and sharpens their skills for a “successful career in public service”.

The princess is heir to the Belgian throne, as the eldest of four children born to King Philippe and Queen Mathilde. Before attending Harvard she earned a degree in history and politics from the University of Oxford.

Pakistan suffered 7th highest number of casualties from explosives in 2024: report,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan was the seventh most affected country for civilians harmed by explosive weapons in 2024, with 790 civilian casualties and 210 killings, recorded across 248 incidents in the country, according to a report released by UK-based NGO, Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) on Thursday.

Titled, ‘Action on Armed Violence’ (AOAV), the report notes that the casualties in 2024 represent a nine per cent decrease from 2023. However, there was a 11 per cent increase in incidents compared to 218 in 2023. Pakistan was listed at seventh position among the 15 most affected countries and territories in 2024.

The majority of civilians harmed was attributed to non-state actors, who were reported responsible for 76pc of civilian casualties. In particular, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) killed and injured 119 civilians in Pakistan last year.

The BLA is among the biggest non-state users of explosive weapons in 2024, and it was the reported perpetrator of 15pc civilian casualties, marking a 440pc increase from 22 incidents recorded in 2023. Unknown non-state actors accounted for 54pc of civilian casualties (423), down from 541 recorded civilian casualties in 2023.

All suicide bombings in the country were carried out by non-state actors, most notably, of the known non-state actors, were the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), who were responsible for 2pc of all 9 incidents, but 89pc (92) of civilian casualties resulting from suicide bombings. Unknown non-state actors accounted for 6pc (5) of incidents, and 11pc of civilian casualties.

Overall, 2024 saw the highest number of recorded incidents in Pakistan since 2014, and the second highest number of civilian casualties since 2018, and the second highest number of armed actor casualties since 2015.

Trump’s evidence of South Africa ‘white genocide’ contains images from Democratic Republic of Congo,"The evidence of supposed mass killings of white South Africans presented by Donald Trump in a tense White House meeting on Wednesday were in some cases images from the Democratic Republic of Congo, while footage shown during the meeting was falsely portrayed as depicting “burial sites”.

“These are all white farmers that are being buried,” said Trump, holding up a print-out of an article accompanied by a picture during the contentious Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

The picture accompanying the article was in fact a screengrab of a video published by Reuters on 3 February and subsequently verified by the news agency’s fact check team, showing humanitarian workers lifting body bags in the Congolese city of Goma. The image was pulled from Reuters footage shot after deadly battles with Rwanda-backed M23 rebels.

The White House did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

At another point in the meeting, Trump ambushed Ramaphosa by playing a video that he claimed proved genocide is being committed against white people in South Africa. Within it was footage that Trump claimed showed the graves of more than a thousand white farmers, marked by white crosses.

The footage – taken at a highway connecting the small towns of Newcastle and Normandein in South Africa – in fact showed a memorial site, and not graves.

Rob Hoatson, who set up the memorial to capture public attention, told the BBC it was not a burial site.

“It was a memorial. It was not a permanent memorial that was erected. It was a temporary memorial,” he said. The memorial was setup in the aftermath of a murder of two Afrikaner farmers in the local community.

The video played by Trump on Wednesday contained several falsehoods and inaccuracies, but was intended to back the president’s offer of “refuge” to persecuted white farmers, which has angered the South African government which disputes the allegations. The White House claimed it showed evidence of genocide of white farmers in South Africa. This conspiracy theory, which has circulated among the far-right for years, is based on false claims.

The video prominently featured Julius Malema, a firebrand politician known for his radical rhetoric. He was seen in several clips wearing the red beret of his populist, Marxist-inspired Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party and chanting calls to “cut the throat of whiteness” as well as a controversial anti-apartheid song “Kill the Boer, kill the farmer”.

1:12 Donald Trump ambushes South Africa's president with video falsely claiming white genocide – video

Trump falsely said he was a government official, insinuating his inflammatory slogans reflected an official policy against South Africa’s white minority.

Malema is an opposition politician who gained prominence advocating radical reforms including land redistribution and nationalising key economic sectors.

The party only came fourth in last year’s elections, with 9.5% of the vote. During the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa and his delegation distanced themselves from Malema’s rhetoric.

Agriculture minister John Steenhuisen, a member of the centre-right Democratic Alliance, told Trump he joined Ramaphosa’s multiparty coalition “precisely to keep these people out of power”.

Ramaphosa visited Washington this week to try to mend ties with the United States after persistent criticism from Trump in recent months over South Africa’s land laws, foreign policy, and alleged bad treatment of its white minority, which South Africa denies.

Dave Shapiro: Sum 41 music agent killed in San Diego plane crash,"Sum 41 music agent among those killed in San Diego plane crash

14 hours ago Share Save Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC News Share Save

Getty Images Several houses were damaged and cars caught fire in the plane crash, authorities said

Prominent music agent Dave Shapiro is among those who were killed after a small plane crashed into a residential street in San Diego, according to his talent agency. Mr Shapiro was the co-founder of Sound Talent Group, whose clients include rock bands like Sum 41, Story of the Year and Pierce the Veil. Daniel Williams, former drummer for the band The Devil Wears Prada, is also feared to have been involved in the crash. Media reports indicate he posted on social media from the plane. Federal officials say there were six people on board the plane and all are presumed dead. The crash destroyed one home and damaged 10 others in the Murphy Canyon neighbourhood, leaving charred cars and fiery debris.

""We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,"" a spokesman for Sound Talent Group said in a statement to the BBC. ""Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today's tragedy. Thank you so much for respecting their privacy at this time."" The company said it lost ""three employees in the plane crash"" including Shapiro. It did not identify the others. San Diego authorities confirmed at least two people were killed in the crash, though the National Transportation Safety Board - which is investigating the incident - said the total death toll is still unclear. Authorities have not released the names of any of those killed. The plane, a Cessna 550 aircraft, veered into the neighbourhood around 3:45 local time (10:45 GMT). Such planes can carry up to 10 people, including a pilot, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Six were on board at the time of the crash. In addition to his music career, Mr Shapiro was an avid pilot and a certified flight instructor with 15 years of experience, according to his aviation company Velocity Aviation. Mr Williams, who is thought to have also been on the plane, posted several Instagram stories in the hours before the crash. The posts showed him with Mr Shapiro and him sitting in the co-pilot seat next to the music executive, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. The post showed the flight number, which matched the one that crashed, the newspaper reported.

Doctors and whistleblowers in delayed Gaza film threaten to pull out,"Doctors and whistleblowers who featured in a much-delayed Gaza documentary that the BBC was accused of censoring by Susan Sarandon, Gary Lineker and other cultural figures, are threatening to withdraw their consent due to the continued refusal to broadcast the film.

This month it emerged that the BBC had shelved broadcasting Gaza: Medics Under Fire, which was ready to air in February, until it finishes investigating a separate, unrelated film called Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, which was pulled from iPlayer after it emerged its young narrator was the son of a Hamas official.

An open letter about the delay was sent to the BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, by more than 600 signatories – including Harriet Walter, Miriam Margolyes, Maxine Peake and Juliet Stevenson – claiming: “This is not editorial caution. It’s political suppression.

“No news organisation should quietly decide behind closed doors whose stories are worth telling. This important film should be seen by the public, and its contributors’ bravery honoured.”

With some BBC staff now concerned at how politically sensitive the issue has become, the Guardian has learned that some of the contributors to Gaza: Medics Under Fire – some of whom likely took risks to talk to Basement Films, the company that made the programme – are now considering withdrawing the consent they gave for their appearances to be used.

In addition, other broadcasters and platforms have offered to air the documentary instead but that move has been vetoed by the corporation.

Despite the programme being cleared for broadcast and passed by lawyers who ensure it complies with broadcasting codes and guidelines, it is understood the BBC is now asking for changes to it and says it will not show the film until the completion of an internal review being carried out by its director of editorial complaints, Peter Johnston, into Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.

However, it is not known when that will be as insiders claim the main interviews only took place last week and lawyers are involved. “People are sick of the whole thing,” said one source.

The issue is particularly contentious for the BBC news and current affairs division as the Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone documentary was so high-profile that the head of BBC News attended its press screening. So when the chair of the BBC, Samir Shah, said in March that the failings of that film were a “dagger to the heart” of the BBC’s claims of trustworthiness and impartiality, it made staff nervous.

Meanwhile, in response to the BBC’s decision to continue delaying its medics film, Basement Films – which was founded by a former editor of Channel 4 News Ben de Pear – is now running films from other doctors in Gaza on its social media.

A spokesperson for Basement Films said: “We apologise again to those who trusted us with their stories … Understandably many of the contributors and those who filmed for us in Gaza are starting to reconsider their consent for the film now it is months delayed, despite being signed off and lauded by some senior management at BBC News.

“We have many offers from broadcasters and platforms across the world so that the searing testimonies of Gazan medics and of surviving family members can be heard, in some cases eight months after we spoke to them … We are still urging BBC News to do the right thing.”

A BBC spokesperson said: “We have taken an editorial decision not to broadcast this documentary while we have an ongoing review into a previous documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone. We understand the importance of telling these stories and know that the current process is difficult for those involved.”",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/may/22/doctors-and-whistleblowers-in-delayed-gaza-film-threaten-to-pull-out,World
"IsDB Launches 2025 Resilience Report, Calls for Broader Economic Strategies in Fragile Member Countries","Algiers, Algeria, 20 May 2025: The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) has launched its 2025 Resilience Report, which examines how climate change and conflict affect fragile Member Countries, during the Group’s Annual Meetings in Algiers. High-level officials and development experts explored how Member Countries can reduce their reliance on commodities and build more stable, resilient economies.

Speaking at the session, IsDB Vice-President for Operations, Dr. Rami Ahmad, painted a hopeful picture, stressing that many Member Countries, currently dependent on oil, gas, and raw materials, can transform their vulnerability into strength. He said diversification is not just an economic goal—it is a shield against future shocks and a pathway to prosperity, peace, and opportunity for all, instilling a sense of optimism in the audience. Mr. Alvaro Lario, the President of IFAD and Mr. Gilles Carbonnier, the Vice President, ICRC, have also made opening remarks and stressed the need for stronger collaboration to tackle the challenges posed by fragility, conflict and climate.

The session brought together key leaders and partners, including:

H.E. Mohamed Arkab, MoS, Minister of Energy, Renewable Energies & Mining, Algeria

H.E. Dr. Anggito Abimanyu, Deputy Minister of Finance, Indonesia

Dr. Alvaro Lario, President of IFAD

Mr. George Nyeso Stanley, Director of International Economic Relations Department, Nigeria

Mrs. Kirstine Damkjaer, Assistant Secretary-General and Deputy Executive Director – Delivery and Partnerships, United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)

Mr. Gilles Carbonnier, Vice-President of the ICRC

Member Countries shared examples of how they are changing their economic models. Indonesia is developing downstream industries. H.E. Mr of State Akbar shared with the audience that Algeria has launched several initiatives, including increasing access to clean energy and the use of green technologies across the country. Capitalising on the availability of significant sunlight in Algeria, the government aims to reach 700 MW of solar energy, with 200 MW already reached with the plant in Gara Djebilet.

The 2025 Resilience Report shows that nine fragile Member Countries are especially at risk from floods, droughts, health emergencies, and displacement—over 43 million people were displaced in 2024 alone.

Dr. Rami Ahmad also highlighted some of IsDB’s ongoing work:

$5.5 billion in climate finance mobilised over three years

“Resilience and diversification must go hand in hand,” Dr. Rami Ahmad said. “We must invest in human capital, innovation ecosystems, and inclusive economic systems that protect livelihoods and promote long-term stability.”

The session gave Member Countries an opportunity to share lessons, discuss policy tools, and build stronger partnerships for long-term development.",https://www.isdb.org/news/isdb-launches-2025-resilience-report-calls-for-broader-economic-strategies-in-fragile-member-countries,World
Classifying Taliban as ‘foreign terrorist organization’ under review: US,"A ‘comprehensive review’ of the US’s chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 has also been ordered.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the United States is reviewing whether to designate Afghanistan’s rulers, the Taliban, as a “foreign terrorist organization”.

Rubio told the House Foreign Affairs Committee during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday, “I believe that classification is now, once again, under review.”

The response came a day after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a “comprehensive review” of the United States’s chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, an evacuation operation in which 13 US service members and 150 Afghans were killed at Kabul’s airport in an ISIL (ISIS) bombing.

Hegseth said in a memo on Tuesday that after three months of assessing the withdrawal, a comprehensive review was needed to ensure accountability for this event.

“This remains an important step toward regaining faith and trust with the American people and all those who wear the uniform, and is prudent based on the number of casualties and equipment lost during the execution of this withdrawal operation,” Hegseth wrote.

Former President Joe Biden’s administration, which oversaw the pull-out, mostly blamed the resulting chaos on a lack of planning and reductions in troops by the first Donald Trump administration, following its deal with the Taliban to accelerate the withdrawal of US forces.

Trump had signed the deal with the Taliban in Doha in February 2020 aimed at ending its 18-year war in Afghanistan, beginning with the withdrawal of about 4,000 troops “within months”.

The then-Trump administration had agreed it would withdraw from the country by May 2021 if the Taliban negotiated a peace agreement with the Afghan government and promised to prevent internationally designated terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda and ISIL, from gaining a foothold in the country.

After assuming office in January 2021, Biden said he had to respect the agreement or risk new conflicts with the Taliban, which could have required additional troops in Afghanistan.

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump frequently criticised Biden and his administration for the withdrawal, saying that the manner in which it was done “was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country’s life.” Trump said that the withdrawal should have been done with “dignity, with strength, with power.”

Senior US military officials, including then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the then-top US general, Mark Milley, have already appeared before lawmakers to give their testimonies regarding the withdrawal.

The war in Afghanistan from 2001-2021 was the US’s longest war, surpassing Vietnam.

It remains unclear how Hegseth’s review would differ from the many previous reviews carried out by the US military, Department of State and Trump’s fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives.
