"Oppo A3 Price Dropped in Pakistan; Save Up to Rs 3,000 on 6/128GB Variant","Usama Rasool May 27, 2025

The Chinese phone maker has quietly given a price cut to one of its entry-level devices in Pakistan. Oppo A3 (6/128GB) is now offering users a discount of up to Rs 3,000, making the phone a more attractive option in the competitive budget segment.





The Oppo A3 was previously available at Rs 43,000, but with the official price cut, you can now purchase it for Rs. 39,999 across Pakistani stores. This should raise the phone‚Äôs value proposition in the market, putting it back in the spotlight. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of all its specifications.

Oppo Latest Budget Model Price in Pakistan 2025

This device has a Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip inside, which provides the Oppo A3 with 4G connectivity and decent processing speeds. It‚Äôs capable enough to glide through your daily workloads without breaking a sweat, and 6 GB RAM should be plenty for light multitasking.





There‚Äôs a 6.67‚Äù IPS screen on the front of Oppo latest budge model that serves you a standard 720p resolution and a 1000 nits brightness level. One of its better qualities is a 90Hz refresh rate for fluid animations and visuals. This phone also has a 180Hz touch response rate and reinforced Panda Glass.

The handsets launched in the budget market usually cut some corners to achieve lower prices. Oppo A3 is laced with compromises in the camera department. There‚Äôs only a 5 MP camera on the front, which is usually considered subpar within this price range.





We get two other sensors on the back: one is a 50 MP primary, and the other is an unspecified assistive lens with an LED flash on the side. There is a fingerprint reader beneath the volume key, and the phone powers everything up using a 5100mAh battery under the hood.

"Galaxy Z Flip7's Exynos 2500 chipset gets benchmarked, here are the results","Samsung is now rumored to be using the delayed Exynos 2500 chipset for the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip7 smartphone. And a benchmark run of a prototype, bearing the model number SM-F766U, has been spotted in the Geekbench database. That's interesting since that model number belongs to the version headed to the US, so it seems very likely that the Flip7 will use the Exynos 2500 all over the world.

The benchmark gives us an idea of what to expect, performance-wise, from the SoC that was meant to be in the Galaxy S25 family but ended up being replaced with the Snapdragon 8 Elite due to yield issues. Let's just outright say it: it's definitely not up there with the Snapdragon 8 Elite.

The Flip7 prototype managed a 2,012 single-core score and a 7,563 multi-core score, which is more in line with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 than its successor. And when we take a look at the CPU configuration, it starts to make sense - this chip has a ten-core CPU, with one Cortex-X925 core clocked at up to 3.3 GHz, two Cortex-A725 cores clocked at up to 2.75 GHz, five Cortex-A725 cores clocked at up to 2.36 GHz, and two Cortex-A520 cores clocked at up to 1.8 GHz.

The clocks are much lower on this chip than on its competitors from Qualcomm, MediaTek, and even Xiaomi. We're not sure whether that's a specific setup for this device, given how it's a foldable and won't be great at heat dissipation, or if this is the standard Exynos 2500 configuration.

Anyway, the Flip7 will launch running Android 16 with One UI 8 on top, and will have 12GB of RAM, according to the Geekbench database.

Cybersecurity agency warns of data breach affecting over 180 mln Pakistani internet accounts,"ISLAMABAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The National Cyber Emergency Response Team (PKCERT) of Pakistan warned that login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet accounts in the country have been stolen in a massive global data breach.

It was learnt from an advisory on Tuesday that the agency had urged citizens to take immediate protective measures to secure their online accounts.

The advisory revealed that the breach involved a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing over 184 million unique account credentials on different platforms, including social media.

According to the agency, the breach included usernames, passwords, emails, and associated URLs for major global services like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, as well as government portals, banking institutions, and healthcare platforms worldwide.

""The leaked database is believed to have been compiled using infostealer malware, a malicious software that extracts sensitive information from compromised systems,"" the advisory noted.

PKCERT, a federal agency tasked with protecting Pakistan's digital assets, warned of severe potential impacts of this breach, including account takeovers, identity theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive government portals and other sites.

To safeguard against these threats, PKCERT advised users to immediately change their passwords and enable multi-factor authentication on all online services, particularly for financial and administrative accounts.

""Timely action is essential to limit the impact of this massive credential breach and prevent subsequent compromise of systems and identities,"" it stated, stressing the need to change compromised credentials, enforce multi-factor authentication, and raise user awareness of data breach risks. ‚ñ†",https://english.news.cn/asiapacific/20250527/486cde2157ef4e5e9b44afb6e8f2344b/c.html,Technology
"Realme‚Äôs new GT 7 and 7T squeeze in enormous 7,000mAh batteries","is a senior reporter who‚Äôs been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

After exclusively launching its GT 7 smartphone in China last month, Realme has finally announced two global versions of the phone that feature a massive 7,000mAh battery: the GT 7 and the slightly cheaper GT 7T.

The GT 7 comes in black and blue color options and starts at ‚Ç¨749.99 for 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. There‚Äôs also a limited Dream Edition of the GT 7, created in collaboration with the Aston Martin Formula One Team, configured with 16GB/512GB for ‚Ç¨899.99. The GT 7T, available in an additional yellow color option, starts at ‚Ç¨649.99 for a 12GB/256GB configuration. Both versions are now available for preorder through Realme‚Äôs website for the European and Indian markets.

Despite all that battery power, the GT 7 is just 8.3mm thick (the GT 7T is 8.25mm thick). For comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick with a 3,582mAh battery, while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra measures in at 8.2mm with only a 5,000mAh battery.

The Realme GT 7 is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 9400e processor and features a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 2780 x 1264 pixel resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 6,000 nits of peak brightness. The phone‚Äôs 7,000mAh battery will keep it running for up to three days of light usage, claims Realme, or up to seven hours with intense gaming. There‚Äôs no wireless charging, but with its included 120W charger and a USB-C cable the GT 7 can be charged to 50 percent capacity in 14 minutes, while a full charge takes 40 minutes.

On the back of the GT 7 you‚Äôll find a 50MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom capabilities, another 50MP camera with optical image stabilization, and an 8MP ultrawide shooter. On the front is a 32MP selfie camera, and an optical fingerprint scanner hidden beneath its display. The GT 7 offers IP69 dust and water resistance; supports Wi-Fi 7, NFC, and Bluetooth 5.4; and launches with Android 15. Realme promises four additional OS updates and six years of Android security updates.

The cheaper Realme GT 7T features only two cameras on the back but is available in an additional yellow color option. Image: Realme

The cheaper GT 7T is instead powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8400-Max processor, and although it has a slightly larger 6.8-inch screen with a small bump in resolution, the display‚Äôs max brightness is limited to just 1,800 nits. The 7T variant also only features two cameras on the back, ditching the GT 7‚Äôs telephoto offering for just a 50MP main camera and a second 8MP option with a wide-angle lens.",https://www.theverge.com/news/674621/realme-gt-7-7t-smartphones-battery-life,Technology

New Realme 4G Mobile 2025 Price in Pakistan

Its chassis is made of die-cast aluminum with a plastic back and glass front. It‚Äôs rated IP64 for dust and splash resistance, which is pretty decent for a phone at this price. Note 60‚Äôs display has reinforced glass that makes it safe from scratches and fall damage.





Speaking of displays, the new Realme 4G mobile carries a massive 6.74‚Äù IPS LCD with a waterdrop notch. There‚Äôs only a 5MP front camera, so you might need to get comfortable with low-res selfies. A 560 nits typical brightness with 720p resolution is modest, but we do find its 90Hz refresh rate commendable.

It is presented with two camera lenses on the back, but there‚Äôs only one usable sensor here with a 32MP resolution, which can do 1080p 30FPS videos. The other lens is only for decorative purposes. This model is 7.8mm thin, a quality that isn‚Äôt easy to come by on an entry-level device.





You get a massive 5000mAh cell inside this phone, providing a decent one-day backup. The only caveat is the slow 10W charging. It might need more than two hours to refill. The Note 60 carries a weak Unisoc T612 processor, running a system with Android 14 x Realme UI 5 out of the box.

"Windows Server emergency update fixes Hyper-V VM freezes, restart issues","Microsoft has released an emergency update to address a known issue causing some Hyper-V virtual machines with Windows Server 2022 to freeze or restart unexpectedly.

These problems mainly impact Azure confidential VMs, which are designed to protect data while being processed, not just when it's transmitted or stored.

Redmond has addressed this issue with the KB5061906 out-of-band (OOB) cumulative update for Windows Server 2022, which supersedes all previous updates.

Microsoft says this OOB update fixes ""An issue in the direct send path for a guest physical address (GPA) where confidential virtual machines running on Hyper-V with Windows Server 2022 might intermittently stop responding or restart unexpectedly, affecting service availability and requiring manual intervention.""

""This issue primarily affects Azure confidential VMs and is not expected to impact standard in-market Hyper-V deployments, except in rare cases involving preview or pre-production configuration,"" Microsoft added.

KB5061906 will not install automatically on impacted servers and is not delivered through Windows Update. However, it can be installed manually using the standalone MSU package from the Microsoft Update Catalog.

""If you have not yet deployed the May 2025 Windows security update (KB5058385) and your IT environment includes Windows Server 2022 devices running Hyper-V, we recommend applying this OOB update instead,"" Microsoft added. ""If your organization is not affected by this issue, you do not need to install this OOB update.""

Last month, Redmond released another set of emergency updates to address a known issue preventing Windows containers from launching on Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, and Windows Server 2025 systems.

Microsoft also revealed in October 2023 that Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022 security updates released at the time broke VMs on Hyper-V hosts and triggered boot issues and ""failed to start"" errors.

One year earlier, in January and December 2022, it released other emergency Windows Server updates to fix known issues causing problems creating new Hyper-V VMs and preventing the VMs from booting up.",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-server-emergency-update-fixes-hyper-v-vm-freezes-restart-issues/,Technology
"Katz Stealer Malware Targets Major Web Browsers, Crypto Wallets","A newly identified malware-as-a-service (MaaS) threat, known as Katz Stealer, is actively targeting users of popular web browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Mozilla Firefox. The aim: to steal sensitive data such as login credentials, cookies, session tokens, and cryptocurrency wallet information. The malware has been observed exploiting vulnerabilities in over 78 Chromium and Gecko-based browsers, making it a significant concern for both individual users and organizations.







Katz Stealer Infection Chain and Evasion Techniques

Katz Stealer uses a multi-stage infection method that starts with the delivery of extensively obfuscated JavaScript code hidden inside GZIP files. When executed, this code runs a base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads a.NET-based loader payload. This loader injects the stealer into legal processes using techniques such as process hollowing, allowing it to run undetected.

To avoid discovery, Katz Stealer employs extensive evasion measures such as geofencing to prohibit execution in specific zones, virtual machine detection via BIOS queries and system uptime checks, and sandbox evasion by evaluating screen resolution. It also exploits trusted Windows tools such as cmstp.exe to circumvent User Account Control (UAC), granting elevated capabilities without warning users.

Data Exfiltration Capabilities

Once active, Katz Stealer establishes a persistent connection to its command and control (C2) server, downloading further payloads and injecting them into browser processes to harvest sensitive data. Notably, it can bypass Chrome‚Äôs app-bound encryption by extracting decryption keys from Local State files, saving them as plaintext for exfiltration.







Beyond browsers, the malware targets a wide range of applications and platforms, including:

Cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Exodus)

Communication platforms like Discord and Telegram

Email clients such as Outlook and Windows Live Mail

Gaming platforms like Steam

VPN setups, FTP clients, and Ngrok tokens

Its ability to extract data from such a diverse set of applications underscores the malware‚Äôs versatility and the breadth of its threat.",https://www.techjuice.pk/katz-stealer-malware-targets-major-web-browsers-crypto-wallets/,Technology

"China, Russia sign deal to build power plant on moon 'leaving US behind'","The illustration shows Earth's moon. ‚Äî Nasa/File

China and Russia have reached an agreement for the construction of a nuclear power plant on the moon.

A contract of cooperation inked by China and Russia states that the Russian reactor will power the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which is jointly headed by China and Russia and is expected to be finished by 2036, reported Space.com.

The news was made shortly after Nasa unveiled a budget proposal for 2026 that would eliminate the agency's orbital lunar outpost plans.

According to a 2024 interview with Yury Borisov, director general of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, on the Russian state-owned news site TASS, the Chinese-Russian reactor's construction will probably be completed autonomously ""without the presence of humans."" Although it's still unclear exactly how this may be accomplished, Borisov stated that the technology steps are ""almost ready.""

""The station will conduct fundamental space research and test technology for long-term uncrewed operations of the ILRS, with the prospect of a human being's presence on the Moon,"" Roscosmos stated in a notice released on May 8 after the memorandum was signed.

Egypt, Pakistan, Venezuela, Thailand, and South Africa are among the 17 nations that have joined the initiative thus far. The new research station is a permanent, manned lunar colony situated on the moon's south pole. China's 2028 Chang'e-8 mission, the country's first to land a man on the moon, will lay the foundation for it.

China and Russia said in June 2021 that they will use five super heavy-lift rocket launches between 2030 and 2035 to loft the components for a robotic moon base as part of the ILRS programme.",https://www.geo.tv/latest/606242-china-russia-sign-deal-to-build-power-plant-on-moon-leaving-us-behind,Technology
Samsung Is Working on Palm Print Scanner for Smartphones ‚Äì Is It More Secure Than Fingerprint Scanner?,"Have you ever heard of a palm print scanner to make smartphones more secure? Unlocking your smartphone has come a long way in recent years. There are many ways to do it. You can use a PIN, password, fingerprint, or even face recognition. But not all of these methods are equally safe.

PINs are fast and easy to use. But many people choose simple or common numbers. That makes them easier for hackers to guess. Passwords can be more secure, but they are also harder to remember. If you choose an easy one, it can be just as risky as a weak PIN.

Samsung Is Working on Palm Print Scanner for Smartphones ‚Äì Is It More Secure Than a Fingerprint Scanner?

Biometric options like fingerprint or facial recognition feel more secure. You don‚Äôt need to remember anything, and it takes just a second to unlock your device. But even these methods have some weaknesses. Skilled hackers can sometimes trick these systems. However, most of those attacks require access to your phone and a lot of effort. For most users, biometrics are still safe.

Even so, companies like Samsung are working on something better. Recently, Samsung filed a European patent for a palm print recognition system for smartphones. This system would use your smartphone‚Äôs camera and special software to scan your palm.

Here‚Äôs how it works. The phone would capture an image of your palm. It would then analyze at least three key points, along with the angle of your hand. This data would be used to confirm your identity.

Palm recognition may be more secure than fingerprints. That‚Äôs because it covers a wider area of your hand and goes deeper than the skin‚Äôs surface. Some palm scanners can even detect vein patterns beneath the skin. These patterns are very hard to copy, making this method more difficult to fool.

In the past, researchers created tricks like ‚ÄúDeepMasterPrints‚Äù using artificial intelligence to fool fingerprint systems. Another method called ‚ÄúBrutePrint‚Äù tried to force its way into devices by quickly testing many fake fingerprints. But so far, these techniques have not been seen in real-life hacking cases.

Even though current biometric tools like fingerprint and facial scanners are safe enough for most users, Samsung is looking ahead. Palm print scanning could be the next big step in smartphone security. While it‚Äôs just a patent now, it shows where future devices might be heading.

Samsung has not revealed any plan to add this feature to its upcoming Galaxy phones. If they do, your palm‚Äînot your fingerprint‚Äîmight be the new key to your phone.",https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/samsung-is-working-on-palm-print-scanner-for-smartphones-is-it-more-secure-than-fingerprint-scanner/,Technology

Is this the future of medicine? Ultrasound-based 3D printing could replace surgeries,"A groundbreaking development in ultrasound-based 3D printing could change the way we approach tissue repair, potentially eliminating the need for invasive surgeries.

Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have created a system that prints tissues directly inside the body using a liquid bioink that solidifies when exposed to ultrasound.

This technique marks a major leap from traditional 3D printing, which typically uses light to create structures.

While light-based methods are limited by how deep they can reach inside the body, ultrasound can penetrate deeply into internal organs, offering a far more versatile and effective solution for tissue regeneration.

In tests, this system successfully printed tissues inside the stomach of a rabbit and the bladder of a mouse.

What sets this new method apart is its ability to integrate biosensors and medication depots. In the tests, the 3D-printed tissues included drugs like anticancer treatments, which were released when triggered by ultrasound.

This could open up new possibilities for treating conditions such as cancer, organ failure, and even nerve damage, without the need for additional surgeries or lengthy recovery times.

The California Institute of Technology‚Äôs technique goes a step further, creating stable structures inside complex organs like the stomach or bladder.

Traditional bioprinting requires external surgeries to implant the tissue, but this ultrasound method could be performed entirely inside the body, drastically reducing the risk of scarring, infection, or inflammation. The bioink is also designed to break down safely once its task is complete.

Though the technology is still in its early stages, its potential to revolutionize medical treatment is undeniable.

The ability to print tissues directly inside the body could transform how we treat a range of medical conditions, offering faster recovery times and far less invasive procedures.

If refined, this technique could mark a new era in bioengineering‚Äîcould this be the future of medicine?",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2547901/is-this-the-future-of-medicine-ultrasound-based-3d-printing-could-replace-surgeries,Technology
‚ÄòDesktop Survivors 98‚Äô Can Turn Your PC Into A Retro Battleground,"Ever thought about playing Windows 98 as a retro battleground game? Well, with ‚ÄúDesktop Survivors 98,‚Äù you can.







To those of you who do not know, Desktop Survivors 98 is an action-packed game that transforms your actual Windows desktop into a chaotic battlefield. In a roguelike genre fashion, it draws from both modern gameplay mechanics and nostalgic aesthetics.

Indie developer Brandon Hesslau has released the game on Steam and has since turned quite a few heads due to its unconventional approach to bullet-hell mayhem. The game which dropped on May 20 has since garnered a near-perfect 9/10 review on Steam.

Desktop Survivors 98: The Lore

Inspired by titles like Vampire Survivors, Desktop Survivors 98 lets players control a character represented by their cursor. The little guy is seen battling endless waves of enemies that spawn directly on the desktop interface. Power-ups, weapons, and enemies all appear over existing windows and icons, blending gaming with day-to-day computer use in real time.







What sets the game apart is its major dedication to the Windows 98 era. The game delivers a strong taste of nostalgia and keeps modern roguelike characteristics. Players must avoid opponents dressed as Clippy‚Äôs long-lost relative, Swordy, and use patience cards and the MS Paint bucket. The cursor-driven, fast-paced gameplay involves the smart use of unique upgrades scattered throughout the screen, as well as the ability to react rapidly.

Users‚Äô Feedback on Desktop Survivors 98 So Far

Despite its novelty, some players have raised concerns, including visibility issues on dark backgrounds and enemies spawning too close to the cursor. However, community feedback has largely been positive, praising the game‚Äôs creativity, humor, and unique desktop integration.

A Boost to the Retro Gaming Fandom

Desktop Survivors 98 is designed for both quick five-minute bursts and longer sessions, with accessibility features like an instant toggle on/off system, making it a flexible addition to any gamer‚Äôs library.

Whether you‚Äôre a fan of retro computing or looking for a new take on roguelike chaos, Desktop Survivors 98 offers an experience that‚Äôs equal parts charming and chaotic.

The game, now live on Steam, continues to gain traction among indie game fans and retro enthusiasts alike despite user concerns over trivial aspects.",https://www.techjuice.pk/desktop-survivors-98-can-turn-your-pc-into-a-retro-battleground/,Technology
"Mistral Releases Devstral, an Open-Source LLM for Software Engineering Agents","Mistral AI announced the release of Devstral, a new open-source large language model developed in collaboration with All Hands AI. Devstral is aimed at improving the automation of software engineering workflows, particularly in complex coding environments that require reasoning across multiple files and components. Unlike models optimized for isolated tasks such as code completion or function generation, Devstral is designed to tackle real-world programming problems by leveraging code agent frameworks and operating across entire repositories.

Devstral is part of a new class of agentic language models, which are designed not just to generate code, but to take contextual actions based on specific tasks. This agentic structure allows the model to perform iterative modifications across multiple files, conduct explorations of the codebase, and propose bug fixes or new features with minimal human intervention. These capabilities are aligned with the demands of modern software engineering, where understanding project structure and dependencies is as important as writing syntactically correct code.

According to Mistral's internal evaluations, Devstral achieves a performance score of 46.8% on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark composed of 500 manually screened GitHub issues. This score places it ahead of previously published open-source models, surpassing them by over six percentage points. The benchmark tests not only whether models can generate valid code but whether that code actually resolves a documented issue in a real project. When compared on the same OpenHands framework, Devstral outperforms significantly larger models such as Deepseek-V3-0324, which has 671 billion parameters, and Qwen3 232B-A22B, highlighting the model‚Äôs efficiency.

Devstral was fine-tuned from the Mistral Small 3.1 base model. Before training, the vision encoder was removed, resulting in a fully text-based model optimized for code understanding and generation. It supports a long context window of up to 128,000 tokens, allowing it to ingest large codebases or extended conversations in a single pass. With a parameter size of 24 billion, Devstral is also relatively lightweight and accessible for developers and researchers. The model can run locally on a consumer-grade GPU such as the NVIDIA RTX 4090, or on Apple Silicon devices with 32GB of RAM. This lowers the barrier to entry for teams or individuals working in constrained environments or handling sensitive codebases.

Mistral has made Devstral available under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, which allows both commercial and non-commercial use, as well as modifications and redistribution. The model can be downloaded through various platforms including Hugging Face, LM Studio, Ollama, and Kaggle. It is also accessible via Mistral‚Äôs own API under the identifier devstral-small-2505.

Community feedback reflects a mix of excitement and critical evaluation. Product Builder, Nayak Satya commented:

Another promising enhancement from Mistral. This company is silently building some great additions for AI space. Europe is not far behind in AI when Mistral stands tall. Meantime can it be added inside VS studio or any modern IDE'S folks?

On Reddit‚Äôs r/LocalLLaMA, users praised Devstral‚Äôs performance, user Coding9 posted:

It works in Cline with a simple task. I can't believe it. Was never able to get another local one to work. I will try some more tasks that are more difficult soon!

Although Devstral is released as a research preview, its deployment marks a step forward in the practical application of LLMs to real-world software engineering. Mistral has indicated that a larger version of the model is already in development, with more advanced capabilities expected in upcoming releases. The company is inviting feedback from the developer community to further refine the model and its integration into software tooling ecosystems.",https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/05/mistral-devstral-agentic/,Technology

Android 16 Introduces Long-Awaited Fingerprint Renaming Feature,"Android users often found themselves limited when it came to managing saved fingerprints, especially when trying to identify or manage multiple ones. That‚Äôs about to change. With the upcoming Android 16 update, Google is making a subtle but much-needed improvement to fingerprint management.







With the arrival of Android 16 QPR1 beta, users will finally be able to rename fingerprints after they‚Äôve been set up. This long-requested feature makes it far easier to know which fingerprint belongs to whom, especially for those sharing their device or using multiple fingers.

The addition was first noticed in Google‚Äôs first preview of the Android 16 QPR1 beta. The fingerprint renaming option is now part of the Security settings, giving users clearer control over their enrolled fingerprints.

From Add/Delete to Full Management

Until now, Android users have had limited control over fingerprint settings. You could either add a new fingerprint or delete an existing one, but you couldn‚Äôt tell which was which unless you remembered the order. This often led to confusion and a lack of confidence in fingerprint-based privacy.







Now, users can tap to view all enrolled fingerprints, rename them, and ensure each one is easily identifiable. This change was first reported by Android Authority, highlighting its practical value.

Though minor at first glance, this update is an essential quality-of-life improvement. It is one that other manufacturers like Samsung have had for years in One UI. With this rollout, Android is closing the gap in user-friendly fingerprint personalization.

Android 16 will bring several other enhancements, especially for Pixel phone users, beyond the fingerprint features. While Google hasn‚Äôt fully detailed the extent of the changes, early previews suggest the company is focusing heavily on both usability and privacy.

What may seem like a small tweak is actually a major stride toward better device personalization and security management. With Android 16, users won‚Äôt just unlock their phones, they‚Äôll unlock more control over how they do it.",https://www.techjuice.pk/android-16-introduces-long-awaited-fingerprint-renaming-feature/,Technology

"Motorola mistakenly lists the G56 early, confirms some of its specs","Motorola's Moto G56 has been leaking a lot recently, and earlier today the brand itself managed to mistakenly list it onto its websites in Czechia and Slovakia. The listing seems to have been taken down in the meantime - but you know how the saying goes, the Internet is forever.

So the images in this article are taken straight from Motorola's own official website. The listing has confirmed the previously leaked colorways in which the device will be offered: Pantone Dazzling Blue, Pantone Dill, Pantone Gray Mist, and Pantone Black Oyster.

Also confirmed is the MediaTek Dimensity 7060 at the helm, paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of expandable storage, the 50 MP main rear camera using Sony's Lytia LYT-600 sensor, the 32 MP selfie camera, the 5,200 mAh battery with support for 30W wired charging, the IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, MIL-STD-810H rating for ruggedness (with advertised drop protection up to 1.2m), and Gorilla Glass 7i protection for the screen.

The Moto G56 is finally getting official on May 29.

"After 15 years, WhatsApp is finally ready for the iPad","Meta now has a dedicated iPad app for WhatsApp, more than 15 years after the messaging service and the first iPad launched (2009 and 2010, respectively). Available to download today via the App Store, WhatsApp for iPad supports many of the same features as its iPhone counterpart, allowing users to join audio and video calls with up to 32 people, use both the rear and front device cameras, and share their screen with other call participants.

The WhatsApp for iPad works with iPadOS features like Stage Manager, Split View, and Slide Over, enabling it to run alongside other applications. That means users can view their messages in a split-screen view while browsing the web or watching videos, making the larger screen more practical for multitasking while using the app, compared to constantly switching away from WhatsApp on smaller mobile devices.

If you wanted to use WhatsApp on a larger screen before the iPad app, you had to either run the web version in your iPad‚Äôs browser or use the desktop apps for Mac or PC. In 2022, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said that Meta would ‚Äúlove‚Äù to develop a native iPadOS WhatsApp experience, noting that ‚Äúpeople have wanted an iPad app for a long time.‚Äù

The WhatsApp account on X teased on Monday that the app was coming via a not-so-subtle eyes emoji, but there was no indication that it would drop this soon. Meta is also rumored to be developing an Instagram app for iPad that‚Äôs optimized for the larger display, but the company hasn‚Äôt dropped any hints about that in the way it did for WhatsApp.",https://www.theverge.com/news/674596/whatsapp-ipad-app-meta-availability,Technology
"With the Switch, technology finally caught up to Nintendo","The Nintendo Switch is on the cusp of becoming Nintendo‚Äôs bestselling hardware ever. In retrospect, it‚Äôs easy to see why: it‚Äôs a device that seamlessly transitions from a home console to a handheld, erasing the distinction between the two. It‚Äôs been so successful that Nintendo isn‚Äôt changing all that much with the Switch 2. But both consoles are well-executed versions of ideas Nintendo has been working on since the failed Wii U ‚Äî and maybe even earlier.

Purely by sales numbers, the Wii U was a flop. The Switch has sold more than 150 million units in its eight-year lifetime. The Wii U, by comparison, sold 13.56 million units ‚Äî less than a 10th of what the Switch did ‚Äî making it Nintendo‚Äôs worst-selling home console.

As a result, it had a much shorter lifespan, launching in late 2012 before being superseded by the Switch about four and a half years later. But many of its ideas and its games were not only excellent, they were also well ahead of their time, and, in some ways, predicted several modern trends in gaming.

Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge

The Wii U, with its tablet controller, also worked as a device that could play games on a TV or in handheld mode. The ability to see a game on a big screen or curl up with it on the couch is an enduring one, as the existence of the PlayStation Portal and Steam Deck now show. The concept has become a whole category of video game hardware, and even Xbox wants to make a handheld now. Nintendo‚Äôs interest in the idea long preceded the Wii U, as it toyed with handheld-to-TV connections with things like the Game Boy Advance‚Äôs ability to connect to the GameCube or the Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES.

The Wii U had the major limitation that you couldn‚Äôt play the games if you were too far away from the console, so they weren‚Äôt truly portable. The tablet‚Äôs battery life wasn‚Äôt great, either, so you could only play for so long before having to charge it.

The Switch improved on all of these ideas. Instead of a TV-connected console that could beam a game to the tablet, the Switch was a tablet that could easily display on a TV. The Switch‚Äôs dock made that connection seamless, as it was nearly impossible to mess up just dropping the Switch into the dock so that it could show up on your TV. (And easily recharge the console‚Äôs battery.)

Many of the Switch‚Äôs defining games started out on the Wii U. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the Switch‚Äôs bestselling title by far, is a port of Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was originally going to be a Wii U exclusive before Nintendo decided to release it for the Switch as well. The first Splatoon title launched on Wii U before getting a pair of Switch sequels, and so did the original Super Mario Maker. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Super Mario 3D World, Pikmin 3, and Xenoblade Chronicles X are all great Wii U games that got new life on the Switch.

Image: The Verge

The Switch 2 looks to build off that legacy by being backward compatible with the vast majority of Switch games, including the Switch versions of those Wii U classics. Breath of the Wild will even be getting a third version for the new console with technical improvements. Features like GameShare and GameChat could also help people more easily play games with their friends.

Before the first Switch came out in March 2017, Nintendo was aggressively moving on from the Wii U. Production of the console ended in Japan in January of that year, and the company was also dipping its toes into mobile as another avenue to reach players. Even at the time, the company seemed to realize that it was on to something with the concept. It was just too early. This is something Mario and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto seemed keenly aware of in a 2016 interview with my colleague Andrew Webster around the release of the mobile game Super Mario Run.

‚ÄúI hope people will continue to recognize the areas where Nintendo has taken that first step,‚Äù Miyamoto told The Verge. ‚ÄúAnd hopefully someday people will look back on the Wii U and think ‚ÄòOh wow, I remember when Nintendo did that, and now look at what‚Äôs come of that.‚Äô‚Äù",https://www.theverge.com/games/671323/nintendo-switch-2-wii-u-technology-games,Technology

New tool reveals how DNA nanostructures interact with cell membranes,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Researchers study how DNA nanopores (DNPs) interact with low-curvature supported lipid bilayers over time. Using QCM-D, the study tracks diffusion, aggregation, and incorporation of DNPs, highlighting the role of cholesterol anchors and substrate composition in membrane insertion‚Äîadvancing applications in artificial cells and molecular sensing. Credit: Institute of Science Tokyo

Lipid membranes, which form the outer layer of cells, can be engineered to influence cellular functions. For example, adjusting the permeability of the membrane can improve drug delivery. Adding signaling molecules to the membrane surface can also help direct drugs to specific tissues, increasing treatment precision.

DNA nanostructures are emerging as useful tools for this purpose. By attaching hydrophobic groups like cholesterol, which anchor them into the lipid membrane's hydrophobic core, scientists have been able to alter the membrane's properties, such as increasing its strength or changing its shape.

Researchers from Institute of Science Tokyo (Science Tokyo), Japan, have made a significant advance in characterizing DNA‚Äìlipid interactions using quartz crystal microbalance with energy dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). This technique measures changes in the mass and viscoelastic properties of molecules adsorbed on surfaces.

The study was led by Associate Professor Tomohiro Hayashi, doctoral student Zugui Peng, and Professor Tohru Yagi from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, School of Materials and Chemical Technology, and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, School of Engineering at Science Tokyo.

Published in the journal Nanoscale on 15 April 2025, it offers a novel approach to monitoring how DNA nanostructures attach and interact with lipid membranes. It also reveals mechanical changes, such as variations in stiffness or fluidity, in both the membrane and the DNA layer. These insights are difficult to obtain through conventional optical methods alone.

""This study is the first to apply QCM-D in exploring how DNA nanostructures interact with lipid bilayers. By revealing insights beyond the reach of optical methods, QCM-D proves to be a powerful technique for analyzing various DNA nanostructures,"" says Dr. Hayashi.

The researchers studied the incorporation of six-helix bundle DNA nanopores (DNPs) with one cholesterol and (DNP-1C) three cholesterol tags (DNP-3C) into supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). To model low-curvature membranes similar to those found in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), they used lipid bilayers supported on silicon oxide (SiO 2 ) and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated surface.

Upon introducing the DNPs to the substrate, the researchers observed that both DNP-1C and DNP-3C rapidly attached to the membrane within seconds, but their long-term behaviors differed significantly. DNP-1C formed a soft, stable layer on the membrane surface that remained unchanged over time, while DNP-3C gradually aggregated into a denser, more rigid structure as its surface concentration increased. This aggregation was accompanied by slow, sustained integration into the lipid bilayer.

By measuring the viscosity of the adsorbed layers, the team found that DNP-3C continues to integrate into lipid bilayers for over 10 hours. The researchers propose that the uninserted cholesterol anchors of the tethered DNPs may interact with freely floating DNPs, leading to increased clustering and sustained integration into the lipid layer.

They also found that the supporting substrate strongly influenced interaction dynamics. PEG-supported SLBs facilitated faster incorporation of DNP-3C compared to SLBs on bare SiO 2 , where the negatively charged surface and closer proximity to the membrane inhibited DNP integration.

These findings have important implications for the design and application of DNA nanostructures. ""Our study is crucial for understanding membrane-interacting DNA nanostructures. We believe it will accelerate DNA nanotechnology research, leading to the development of more effective membrane-interacting structures,"" Dr. Hayashi noted.

With QCM-D providing new insights, scientists are now one step closer to designing DNA nanostructures for groundbreaking biomedical applications such as artificial cells and molecular sensors.

New F3T Sensor Offers Breakthrough in Robotic Tactile Sensing,"Researchers have developed an innovative soft tactile unit, known as the F3T sensor, capable of mathematically decoupling three-dimensional (3D) force and temperature measurements. This is a major step forward in robotic tactile sensing.

Image Credit: Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock.com

While human skin naturally distinguishes between contact forces and environmental temperatures, current soft tactile sensors often struggle to separate these signals accurately, limiting their use in more complex robotic tasks. The F3T sensor addresses this challenge with a design inspired by the layered structure of human skin, integrating multiple materials and sensing mechanisms across four layers.

At the top is an ion gel-based film that senses temperature. As temperature shifts, the spacing between polymer chains in the gel changes, altering electrical resistance and allowing for precise, independent temperature detection.

Below that, a circular coaxial magnetic film combined with a floating multilayer capacitor physically separates normal and tangential forces in all directions. The third layer‚Äîanother floating capacitor‚Äîresponds only to normal force, effectively filtering out tangential input. The base layer is a rigid PCB responsible for structural support and signal processing. An internal silicone elastomer mimics the skin‚Äôs hypodermis, cushioning impacts and holding components together.

Together, these layers allow the F3T sensor to accurately distinguish between temperature, normal force, and multidirectional tangential force. When the sensor makes contact with an object, the composite signal it receives is processed in stages: the ion gel decouples and reads the temperature first, followed by the floating capacitor and magnetic film, which isolate and measure the normal and tangential forces, respectively.

Performance testing shows promising results. The sensor‚Äôs temperature readings remain stable even under varying external forces, and its force measurements‚Äîboth normal and tangential‚Äîare highly accurate. It also responds quickly to dynamic changes.

In both static and dynamic tests, the F3T sensor outperformed traditional alternatives. In static scenarios, it measured 3D force and temperature with minimal error. During dynamic testing, a robotic gripper equipped with the sensor was able to adapt to external disturbances and maintain a stable grasp.

The sensor also proved effective in real-world applications. During an automated chemical reaction process, it helped maintain precise control over heating and shaking. In a ‚Äútea delivery‚Äù human-robot interaction task, it enabled the robot to detect human intent and smoothly transfer the cup.

While the F3T sensor shows strong potential, there‚Äôs still room for improvement, particularly in enhancing inter-layer adhesion, ensuring consistency in performance, and minimizing delays in temperature readings. Still, its current capabilities suggest it could enable more adaptable and responsive robotic systems across a range of tasks.

Crystal-modifying agent piracetam provides scalable strategy for high-efficiency all-perovskite tandem solar cells,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

All-perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) are a class of solar cells comprised of two or more sub-cells that absorb light with different wavelengths, all of which are made of perovskites (i.e., materials with a characteristic crystal structure known to efficiently absorb light). These solar cells have been found to be highly promising energy solutions, as they could convert sunlight into electricity more efficiently than existing silicon-based solar cells.

Despite their potential, most all-perovskite TSCs developed to date only perform well when they are small and their performance rapidly declines as their size increases. This has ultimately prevented them from being manufactured and deployed on a large-scale.

Researchers at Wuhan University and other institutes in China recently introduced a new strategy for enhancing the performance of all-perovskite TSCs irrespective of their size, which could in turn contribute to their future commercialization. Their proposed approach for fabricating these cells, outlined in a paper published in Nature Nanotechnology, entails the use of piracetam, a chemical additive that can help to control the initial phase of crystal formation (i.e., nucleation) in wide-bandgap perovskites.

""All-perovskite TSCs offer exceptional performance and versatile applicability,"" wrote Shiqiang Fu, Shun Zhou and their colleagues in their paper. ""However, a significant challenge persists in bridging the power conversion efficiency (PCE) gap between small- and large-area (>1 cm2) devices, which presents a formidable barrier to the commercialization of all-perovskite TSCs. We introduce a specialized crystal-modifying agent, piracetam, tailored for wide-bandgap perovskites, homogenizing top wide-bandgap subcells and enabling the construction of efficient large-area TSCs.""

Piracetam, a synthetic compound with the molecular formula C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄN‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ, was first introduced in the 1960s. As part of their study, the researchers used this compound as a crystal-modifying agent, or more specifically to control the growth of perovskite crystals and eliminate undesirable residual compounds, ultimately improving the performance of all-perovskite solar cells.

""Piracetam, featuring amide and pyrrolidone moieties, initially modulates perovskite nucleation, resulting in large-sized grains, preferred (110) orientation, enhanced crystallinity and uniform optoelectronic properties,"" explained Fu, Zhou and their colleagues. ""During the subsequent annealing process, it further eliminates residual PbI 2 and facilitates the formation of one-dimensional (Pi)PbI 3 (Pi = piracetam) perovskite nanoneedles at the grain boundaries and surfaces.""

The researchers used their proposed approach to synthesize smoother and high-quality wide-bandgap perovskite films, exhibiting fewer defects and an improved crystallinity. They then used these films to create both small and large TSCs, which they evaluated in a series of tests.

""Single-junction 1.77 eV-bandgap solar cells achieve a certified open-circuit voltage of 1.36 V and a PCE of 20.35%,"" wrote Fu, Zhou, and their colleagues. ""Furthermore, our monolithic two-terminal all-perovskite TSCs, with aperture areas of 0.07 cm2 and 1.02 cm2, yield PCEs of 28.71% (stabilized 28.55%, certified 28.13%) and 28.20% (stabilized 28.05%, certified 27.30%), respectively, demonstrating a minimal PCE loss of 0.51% when transitioning from small-area to large-area devices.

""In addition, piracetam demonstrates broad applicability across different perovskite compositions, increasing the PCE from 23.56% to 25.71% for single-junction 1.56 eV-bandgap counterparts.""

The results of this recent study highlight the potential of piracetam as a crystal-modifying agent to improve the quality of wide-bandgap perovskite films for solar cells. In the future, the approach employed by Fu, Zhou and his colleagues could contribute to the advancement of all-perovskite TSCs, boosting their performance as they are scaled up and facilitating their widespread adoption.

The high contrast anti-reflective panel is said to offer an ultra-wide viewing angle that virtually eliminates color shift with a 40% wider color viewing angle than its predecessor. TCL asserts the combined width of a TV‚Äôs bezel and border makes a significant impact on its visual appearance, and the TCL QM8K reduces that total width to just 3 to 4mm (.11 to .15 inches) through special TV and panel materials and design. The QM8K series of TVs employ a one-piece aerospace-grade aluminum alloy mold for high structural rigidity, anodized ceramic film for enhanced panel stability, and now small-scale LCD panel driver circuitry along the panel edges without creating any panel deformation or light leakage, to create a new fresh, premium look.

TCL explains the Halo Control System yields three key benefits including enhanced color accuracy, enhanced gray scale accuracy, as well as virtually no blooming, for more natural picture quality. The new system‚Äôs Super High Energy LED Chip combines high brightness with increased light efficiency while a Super Condensed Micro Lens uses a narrower light path for more precise light control. Additionally, the new TCL Micro OD reduces optical distance between the backlight and diffuser plate, helping avoid light overlap for virtually no blooming or halo effect, to produce clear, sharp edges between bright whites and dark blacks.

Additional Technology Brightens Up Picture, Drives Dynamic HDR

The company goes on to say that its enhanced QD-Mini LED backlight technology works in conjunction with a high contrast WHVA Panel to block out more of the light when the LCD closes for a better dark state, providing up to five times better native contrast. Furthermore, enhanced QLED technology combines a new Color Optimization Algorithm with more vibrant Quantum Crystals for significantly improved color accuracy.

The QM8K is also getting a processing upgrade in the TCL QM8K with Zero-Delay Transient Response for what it says is virtually no lag between the input signal and backlight response, preventing after-image blur and maximizing specular highlights. The Halo Control System also adds a Bi-Directional 23-bit Backlight Controller, allowing the finest granular control of over 65,000 levels of brightness for each LED so gray scale accuracy is elevated. In addition, the system includes a Dynamic Light Algorithm (DLA) that intelligently optimizes the incoming video to render SDR signals at near HDR level, for consistently pristine picture quality regardless of the content metadata.

For those that aren‚Äôt connecting these televisions to audio systems, TCL has also added Audio by Bang & Olufsen to the product line. Cosmetically, the QM8K Series features a thinner, flatter cabinet design to better support flush wall mounting, and the TVs come with pedestal stands for those that want to place their TVs on home theater furniture.

Motorola's 2025 Edge Is Coming Next Week With a Two-Day Battery and TurboPower Charging,"The Motorola 2025 Edge (not to be confused with the just-revealed Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge slim handset) is on its way, and its arrival is imminent. The phone is slated for a June 5 arrival in the US and Canada, and costs $550. This comes soon after the company debuted its new batch of Razr phones.

This year's Edge has a 6.7-inch super HD POLED display, which Motorola says has ""improved contrast"" and ""13% more resolution than the previous generation."" It has a 120Hz refresh rate and, of course, those signature curved edges on the display.

There's a 50-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera, which can punch in with 3x magnification, or up to 30x digital zoom. There's also a 50-megapixel front-facing camera, which sounds like a promising way to level up your selfie game, but we'll have to see.

As we've come to expect from recent phone releases, AI is there to help optimize your shots. Moto's Photo Enhancement Engine can reduce noise, amplify details and improve dynamic range, the company says. Edge owners can also tap into AI features in Google Photos like Magic Editor, Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur.

Speaking of AI, like the 2025 Razr lineup, the Edge flexes a new AI key on the side to trigger Moto AI features such as Pay Attention, which records and summarizes conversations, and Next Move, which looks at what's on your screen and suggests follow-up actions. Google AI features like Gemini Live and Circle to Search are also onboard.

The 2025 Motorola Edge has a 6.7-inch curved display. Motorola

The Edge has an IP68 and IP69 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning it can handle being submerged in up to 1.5 meters of fresh water for up to half an hour, as well as being exposed to high-temperature water jets for up to 30 seconds. It's MIL-STD-810H certified, meaning it's endured military-grade testing for durability. The Corning Gorilla Glass 7i display offers twice the resistance to drops and scratches, Motorola says.

Inside, the 2025 Edge packs a MediaTek Dimensity 7400 chipset, as well as 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The 5,200-mAh battery lasts up to two days on a single charge, according to Motorola, though that'll be worth validating in our own tests. The Edge supports 68-watt TurboPower charging, as well as 15-watt wireless charging. The phone comes with Android 15 out of the box.

The 2025 Edge will be available unlocked in the US on June 5 at Best Buy, Amazon and Motorola's website. If you'd rather get the phone from a carrier, it'll be available at T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, Total Wireless, Visible, Spectrum and Xfinity Mobile in the coming months, Motorola says.

In Canada, you can buy the phone from Motorola's website starting June 5. Availability through select carriers and national retailers has yet to be announced.

In the meantime, you can check out CNET's review of the 2025 Razr and Razr Ultra.",https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/motorolas-2025-edge-is-coming-next-week-with-a-two-day-battery-and-turbopower-charging/,Technology
TCL TVs and speakers will support Dolby FlexConnect this summer,"A Dolby Atmos feature that makes it easier to create a spatial audio setup is coming to select TCL TVs and speakers. TCL is adding support for Dolby Atmos FlexConnect to QD-Mini LED TVs in its 2025 Precise Dimming Series, including the QM8K, QM7K, and QM6K, as well as launching its new Z100 smart speaker to pair with the feature.

FlexConnect allows users to connect their TV with specialized external speakers that can be placed anywhere in a room, providing Atmos-enabled audio without requiring a symmetrical setup. The feature aims to provide an alternative solution to installing a traditional surround-sound system, which can be restricted by room size, outlet locations, and mounting or cabling requirements.

The TCL TVs and wireless speaker are the first devices with FlexConnect support to be announced for the US, with the Z100 having already launched in China for CN¬•1,499 (about $208). US pricing has not been confirmed yet. TCL says that up to four Z100 speakers can be connected to supporting FlexConnect TVs in the US ‚Äústarting this summer.‚Äù

The concept is similar to other wireless Dolby Atmos products like the $2,500 Sony Bravia Theater Quad, but it should be considerably more affordable. Also, while the Theater Quad is only available in gray, the Z100 comes in gray, teal, and beige finishes, which may be easier to coordinate with your home decor.",https://www.theverge.com/news/674545/tcl-tvs-z100-speaker-dolby-flexconnect-launch,Technology
Eastman automates recycling plant to refine new process,"With 353 million metric tons of plastics waste disposed of annually, more chemical manufacturers see opportunities to transform the discarded waste into fresh materials. At the Emerson Exchange event in San Antonio May 22, an engineer from specialty materials producer Eastman Chemical Co. highlighted how the company is using molecular processing technologies to reuse hard-to-recycle plastics.

Unlike conventional mechanical recycling, which processes plastic waste like water bottles into new products without altering their chemical structure, molecular recycling breaks down waste materials into their basic building blocks.

But the technology presents unique operational challenges. The process requires sophisticated automation and instrumentation systems capable of managing extreme temperatures‚Äîoften reaching 600 degrees Fahrenheit‚Äîamong other demanding conditions. The company deployed a series of Emerson instrumentation and control technologies to process the waste in the most efficient and reliable way possible, said Mike Strickler, an associate electrical engineer with Eastman.

Instrumentation key to optimization

Eastman has one plastics recycling facility currently in operation in Kingsport, Tenn., and two more scheduled to come online within the next five years‚Äîone in Longview, Texas, and another in Normandy, France. Strickler focused on the company‚Äôs polyester renewal technology (the company also employs a carbon renewal process for a variety of mixed plastic waste), highlighting how the waste stream moves along a conveyor to a dissolver where it mixes with chemicals and is heated to high temperatures.

‚ÄúThat was one of the areas where Emerson and their advanced technologies were very beneficial,‚Äù Strickler said.

In the past, the company had experienced either time delays or plugging issues with its instrumentation that it ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt overcome,‚Äù said Strickler.

The company deployed the DeltaV distributed control system with four redundant DeltaV PK Controllers, which allowed Eastman to segregate various processes, such as utilities.

‚ÄúSo, if maintenance needed to be done, you could segregate and perform updates,‚Äù Strickler explained.

The configuration includes 32 DeltaV CHARMs I/O cabinets (CIOCs) located throughout the building close to process instrumentation to reduce wiring out to the devices. A key advantage of the deployment was the ability to use HART communication capabilities to access multiple variables from the plant‚Äôs process instruments, Strickler said.

Additionally, a networked data concentrator provided communication and control of motors and vendor skid equipment. This reduced wiring and I/O space and cost.

The company utilized Microsoft Device Manager with the system to help simplify the sensing and identification of the process instrumentation. On the instrumentation side, the company took an aggressive approach to measurement, with 285 Coriolis flowmeters used on the project, including the use of heat jacketing on some devices to gain more uniform heat tracing, said Teresa Edwards, senior sales representative, Emerson.

Instruments boost process understanding

The deployment also included about 400 pressure transmitters, the use of a dual-input temperature transmitter with hot backup configuration and 100 differential pressure transmitters, and 65 high-temperature vortex-shedding flow transmitters with temperature compensation for heat transfer fluid and density compensation, Edwards said.

When Edwards mentioned the number of flowmeters deployed, several session attendees seemed surprised. Edwards explained that Eastman is looking to refine the recycling process with verifiable data before scaling globally.

‚ÄúI know these numbers sound big on the instrumentation side, but you have to remember this has never been done before,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEastman has had this technology for over 20 years, but this is the first time that it went to production scale, so they wanted to make sure that they had enough instruments installed that if something went wrong, they knew why it went wrong and where. So, they wanted to make sure that they had the best technology in the line to give them the information that they needed so that Longview may be able to skip some of the hurdles that Kingsport went through.‚Äù",https://www.controlglobal.com/show-coverage/emerson-exchange/article/55292657/eastman-automates-recycling-plant-to-refine-new-process,Technology

Researchers discover unknown molecules with the help of AI,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

The DreaMS AI enables the characterization of molecular structures present in nature by interpreting mass spectrometry data. Credit: IOCB Prague / CIIRC CTU

Researchers have developed a machine learning model called DreaMS, which significantly accelerates the analysis of previously unknown molecules. The study is published in Nature Biotechnology.

The team includes this year's winner of the Neuron Award for young promising scientists, Dr. Tom√°≈° Pluskal from IOCB Prague, together with his student Roman Bushuiev and colleagues from the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics at the Czech Technical University (CIIRC CTU), Dr. Josef ≈†ivic and Anton Bushuiev.

Nature is full of chemicals that have yet to be discovered. It is believed that the vast majority of natural molecules remain unknown. Describing them could pave the way to new drugs, more environmentally friendly pesticides, a deeper understanding of biological processes, or more advanced research into life in the universe.

Each substance has a unique pattern, similar to a human fingerprint, called a mass spectrum, which can be captured using a method known as mass spectrometry. Although this approach generates large quantities of data, interpreting it and uncovering exact molecular structures is extremely difficult. The resulting datasets often appear as vast tables of numbers with no obvious meaning.

To unravel the mystery of unknown molecules, the team from IOCB and CIIRC CTU turned to artificial intelligence. Much like large language models such as ChatGPT learn to understand language without knowing the meaning of words in advance, the DreaMS model attempts to interpret mass spectra without prior knowledge of their chemical structures.

Researchers from IOCB Prague and CIIRC CTU discover unknown molecules with the help of AI

""ChatGPT can infer the meaning of words and the connections between them from large volumes of text, and the DreaMS neural network, using self-supervised machine learning, learns to recognize what molecular structures are hidden within spectra. It draws on data from millions of examples,"" explains ≈†ivic.

""The DreaMS model was trained on tens of millions of spectra from diverse organisms and environments‚Äîplants, microbes, food, tissue, and soil samples. Thanks to this, it can uncover hidden similarities between spectra that, at first glance, seem unrelated,"" says Pluskal.

The result is an interconnected network that helps navigate the vast body of chemical data. This network, which can be imagined as an internet of mass spectra, has been named the DreaMS Atlas. Each spectrum is like a website linked to others.

On this ""internet of spectra,"" users can search, explore discovered connections, and ask new questions‚Äîfor example: What do pesticides, food, and human skin have in common?

DreaMS uncovered unexpected chemical similarities between them and hypothesized that certain pesticides may be linked to autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis.

In addition to connecting spectra from different studies, DreaMS can also be used for various practical tasks‚Äîfor instance, to estimate how many specific fragments a molecule contains or whether it includes particular chemical elements.

""We were especially surprised that the model learned to detect fluorine,"" says Bushuiev.

""Fluorine is present in about one-third of all drugs and agrochemicals, but we were previously unable to reliably detect it from the mass spectrum. After pretraining DreaMS on millions of spectra, we fine-tuned it with a few thousand examples of fluorine-containing molecules‚Äîand suddenly it worked.""

The researchers are now working on the next step: teaching the model to predict entire molecular structures. If successful, it could fundamentally transform our understanding of chemical diversity‚Äîwhether on planet Earth or beyond.

Cybercriminals Clone Antivirus Site to Spread Venom RAT and Steal Crypto Wallets,"Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new malicious campaign that uses a fake website advertising antivirus software from Bitdefender to dupe victims into downloading a remote access trojan called Venom RAT.

The campaign indicates a ""clear intent to target individuals for financial gain by compromising their credentials, crypto wallets, and potentially selling access to their systems,"" the DomainTools Intelligence (DTI) team said in a new report shared with The Hacker News.

The website in question, ""bitdefender-download[.]com,"" advertises site visitors to download a Windows version of the Antivirus software. Clicking on the prominent ""Download for Windows"" button initiates a file download from a Bitbucket repository that redirects to an Amazon S3 bucket. The Bitbucket account is no longer active.

The ZIP archive (""BitDefender.zip"") contains an executable called ""StoreInstaller.exe,"" which includes malware configurations associated with Venom RAT, as well as code related to the open-source post-exploitation framework SilentTrinity and StormKitty stealer.

Venom RAT is an offshoot of Quasar RAT that comes with capabilities to harvest data and provide persistent remote access to attackers.

DomainTools said the decoy website masquerading as Bitdefender shares temporal and infrastructure overlaps with other malicious domains spoofing banks and generic IT services that have been used as part of phishing activity to harvest login credentials associated with Royal Bank of Canada and Microsoft .

""These tools work in concert: Venom RAT sneaks in, StormKitty grabs your passwords and digital wallet info, and SilentTrinity ensures the attacker can stay hidden and maintain control,"" the company said.

""This campaign underscores a constant trend: attackers are using sophisticated, modular malware built from open-source components. This ""build-your-own-malware"" approach makes these attacks more efficient, stealthy, and adaptable.""

The disclosure comes as Sucuri warned of a ClickFix-style campaign that employs bogus Google Meet pages to deceive users into installing noanti-vm.bat RAT, a heavily obfuscated Windows batch script that grants remote control over the victim's computer.

""This fake Google Meet page doesn't present a login form to steal credentials directly,"" security researcher Puja Srivastava said. ""Instead, it employs a social engineering tactic, presenting a fake 'Microphone Permission Denied' error and urging the user to copy and paste a specific PowerShell command as a 'fix.'""

It also follows a spike in phishing attacks that exploit Google's AppSheet no-code development platform to mount a highly targeted, sophisticated campaign impersonating Meta.

""Utilizing state-of-the-art tactics such as polymorphic identifiers, advanced man‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëmiddle proxy mechanisms and multi-factor authentication bypass techniques, the attackers aim to harvest credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, enabling real-time access to social media accounts,"" the KnowBe4 Threat Lab said in a report.

The campaign entails the use of AppSheet to deliver phishing emails at scale, allowing the threat actors to bypass email security defenses such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC owing to the fact that the messages originate from a valid domain (""noreply@appsheet[.]com"").

Furthermore, the emails claim to be from Facebook Support and employ account deletion warnings to trick users into clicking on fake links under the pretext of submitting an appeal within a 24-hour time period. The booby-trapped links lead victims to an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing page designed to harvest their credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.

""To further evade detection and complicate remediation, the attackers leverage AppSheets' functionality for generating unique IDs, shown as Case IDs in the body of the email,"" the company said.

""The presence of unique polymorphic identifiers in each phishing email ensures every message is slightly different, helping them bypass traditional detection systems that rely on static indicators such as hashes or known malicious URLs.""",https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/cybercriminals-clone-antivirus-site-to_4.html,Technology
"AI Unlocks Jellyfish Movement Control, Offers Insights for Soft Robotics","In an innovative study published in Nature Communications, a research team led by Dai Owaki, an associate professor in the Department of Robotics at Tohoku University‚Äôs Graduate School of Engineering, used moderate electric pulses to successfully regulate jellyfish's swimming behavior. They used a lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) model to forecast each jellyfish‚Äôs swimming speed.

Jellyfish, unlike fish, have no bones and only a rudimentary nerve net, yet they can travel long distances with little energy cost. A jellyfish‚Äôs seemingly smooth glide through the water is due to a ring of muscle within its soft belly, which generates a simple jet that propels it ahead. Scientists call this fundamental potential ‚Äúembodied intelligence,‚Äù implying that the organism‚Äôs physical structure contributes to problem solving.

When harnessed, this movement effectively monitors coral reefs, traces oil spills, and observes climate change. ‚ÄúJellyfish cyborgs‚Äù use little power and run without engines, reducing the environmental impact of present ways of exploring the huge ocean.

The findings demonstrate the collaborative capability of soft-bodied marine animals with simple electronic systems in aquatic environments, all while maintaining the animal‚Äôs natural swimming style.

Our research team posed two interconnected questions. First, can we identify a pulse pattern that the jellyfish accepts, enabling it to swim at predetermined speeds without undue stress? Second, once the jellyfish responds to these signals, can we develop a compact AI tool capable of predicting its movement in any direction? By addressing these inquiries, we can pave the way for low-energy, environmentally friendly oceanic probes. Dai Owaki, Associate Professor, Department of Robotics, Tohoku University

Owaki's team consisted of Max Austin, an assistant professor, and Kohei Nakajima, an associate professor, both from the Department of Mechano-Informatics at The University of Tokyo‚Äôs Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, as well as Shuhei Ikeda and Kazuya Okuizumi from the Kamo Aquarium in Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture.

The team used small electrodes on the jellyfish‚Äôs muscle ring to give short electric pulses every 1.5 to 2 seconds. Each swimming event was captured with a single camera and two mirrors, and the entire three-dimensional route was reconstructed on a laptop. The most efficient pulse timing corresponded to the jellyfish‚Äôs natural rhythm, resulting in increased swimming speed.

The data was then fed into a lightweight hybrid ‚Äúphysical reservoir‚Äù AI model, which includes the jellyfish‚Äôs body as a key component of the computing system. The model predicted future speeds with sufficient accuracy in all transverse directions.

Owaki added, ‚ÄúWe were intrigued to discover that the most effective control signals were not the rapid pulses, but rather those that mirrored the jellyfish's natural rhythm. Attempts to use stronger or faster pulses led to decreased swimming efficiency and erratic movement, underscoring the importance of aligning with the rhythms of nature, rather than opposing them.‚Äù

The concept of a living organism operating as a computational device may sound like science fiction, yet it has the potential to transform many fields. Soft-bodied organisms may inspire advancements in robotic systems with self-healing and flexible qualities.

Fleets of cyborg jellyfish may explore the waters for extended periods of time, measuring temperature, salinity, and plastic pollution without relying on batteries. The study combines marine science and engineering by creating a unique, gentle cyborg swimmer.

Jellyfish were chosen for this study because they have the highest swimming efficiency among marine species, making them a suitable model for investigating the synergy between biological systems and simple hardware. Seeing these exquisite creatures glide across the water inspired the research team to create technology that works with, rather than against, natural ecosystems.

"Scientists on how to age well: ‚ÄòSleep is democratic, universal, cheap, and free, and yet no one sleeps enough‚Äô","The only way to live a long life is by growing old. However, aging is sometimes seen as something undesirable ‚Äî even as a disease that needs to be cured. The problem is that no one yet knows how to do that; there isn‚Äôt even a way to stop the inexorable effects of the passage of time on our bodies.

Despite this, our understanding of aging at the cellular level has advanced significantly in recent years. One of the main figures behind this progress is biologist and physician Ana Mar√≠a Cuervo, 58. Cuervo co-directs the Einstein Institute for Aging Research in New York, which, among other initiatives, is promoting a much-anticipated clinical trial with centenarians to try to uncover the keys to why some people age worse than others. This could one day give all humans the ability to live longer without suffering from age-related diseases ‚Äî even without following particularly healthy lifestyles, as some centenarians manage to do thanks to privileged genetics.

Cuervo visited Madrid on Tuesday to receive the Conchita R√°bago de Jim√©nez D√≠az Memorial Lecture Award, a distinction previously granted to other major figures in research, such as Katalin Karik√≥, the creator of the COVID-19 vaccines, and paleoanthropologist Juan Luis Arsuaga, who nominated Cuervo. A day earlier, both scientists sat down together to reflect on what aging really is ‚Äî and whether it‚Äôs inevitable. Arsuaga offers the first thought: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gone from living as long as a chimpanzee ‚Äî around 45 years ‚Äî to about 85, in just two million years. We‚Äôre not doing badly.‚Äù

Question: Does that progress have a limit?

Ana Mar√≠a Cuervo. Before, people died at 50 and suffered for a year. Now, what we‚Äôve achieved is to extend the period of your life in which you are no longer fully functional, you‚Äôve lost your independence, you can no longer drive because you no longer see well, and on top of that, you‚Äôre more susceptible to age-related diseases. The challenge now is to ensure that the extra years we gain are lived in the best possible condition ‚Äî and for that, we need to change the way we age.

Q. Is aging inevitable after a certain age?

A.M.C. There‚Äôs a programmed factor, which is genetics. Those who come from centenarian families can go to McDonald‚Äôs every day and smoke as much as they want because they have good genes. We asked one of our centenarians if doctors hadn‚Äôt told her to quit smoking, and she replied, ‚ÄúThree doctors have already told me, but all three are dead.‚Äù What we want to learn from them is what genes or cellular pathways are involved so that the rest of us ‚Äî who don‚Äôt come from centenarian families ‚Äî can reach their level and functionality. Aside from this, there‚Äôs also an environmental component. One topic we‚Äôre very interested in is nutrition, and how that exposure is contributing to decline. We begin aging from birth. Everything you‚Äôve done and everything you‚Äôve been exposed to is going to influence how you age.

Juan Luis Arsuaga. Since our entire development is programmed from birth ‚Äî infancy, puberty, even the end of a woman‚Äôs fertile life with menopause ‚Äî why not think that old age is also programmed? It has even been thought that death is programmed, and it was argued that this would serve the species, by allowing for renewal. But the bad news is that the vast majority of biologists believe that aging is not programmed. That‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt hack it.

Q. Are there any interventions or treatments that actually extend people‚Äôs lives?

A.M.C. For now, there are no drugs specifically approved to prolong longevity in humans. A major limitation has been the lack of regulation for conducting clinical trials targeting aging. The first study of this type in the United States, called TAME, will test metformin, a diabetes drug. Retrospective studies in Nordic countries suggest that diabetics treated with metformin live longer than the general population, but it remains to be seen whether this effect is replicated in other groups or if it may be harmful to some. In Singapore, studies are about to begin on acarbose. Rapamycin ‚Äî an immunosuppressant ‚Äî is also being investigated for its possible benefit in reducing chronic inflammation associated with aging. Results are still pending.

Q. Ana Mar√≠a, you advocate for geromedicine. What does it consist of?

A.M.C. We seek to apply advances in the biology of aging to personalized clinical medicine. The idea is that, say at age 50, people could undergo periodic check-ups to detect which aging mechanisms ‚Äî such as mitochondrial function or cellular cleaning through autophagy ‚Äî are impaired in each individual. Based on the results, specific treatments would be applied to improve those areas. What‚Äôs interesting is that it‚Äôs not necessary to fix all damaged processes: the pillars of aging are interconnected, and improving one can have positive effects on the others. It‚Äôs a preventive approach tailored to each person. In the lab, we have genetically modified mice whose autophagy does not deteriorate, and they‚Äôre perfect ‚Äî not a single gray hair, no health problems, despite being very old.

Q. Can that be replicated in humans?

A.M.C. Not directly, because it‚Äôs genetic modification. But now, thanks to the repurposing of already approved drugs and artificial intelligence, there are hardly any limits to finding molecules that slow these processes.

Q. Do humans today age better than those of previous generations?

J.L.A. No. Life expectancy at birth is declining in the United States and Germany. And it‚Äôs basically due to obesity and diet. Life expectancy improved significantly in the last century, especially due to the decline in infant mortality. Now, there‚Äôs virtually no infant mortality. Almost everyone born today reach adulthood. However, as much as medicine has improved, it‚Äôs not advancing enough to compensate for increasingly poor lifestyle habits.

A.M.C. A lot depends on where you live. In the United States, if you‚Äôre from the East or West Coast, you‚Äôll live much longer than in some areas of the interior. If you don‚Äôt have money, you can go to McDonald‚Äôs and get the whole family a meal for a dollar. The biggest predictor is your zip code, which is linked to your educational level.

J.L.A. The only way to be thin is to starve yourself, to control your diet. Exercise is great, but not for losing a lot of weight. Historically, those who went hungry were the poor. Today, cheap food means you don‚Äôt go hungry, no matter how poor you are. Nowadays, it‚Äôs the rich who go hungry, because they take care of themselves.

Q. So it‚Äôs no longer just about how many calories you consume per day?

A.M.C. Autophagy doesn‚Äôt depend on the number of calories, but rather on the spacing between meals and the type of diet. A balanced diet like the Mediterranean one is key ‚Äî more than counting calories. Factors like sex and genetics play a role. What matters is creating periods in which insulin levels drop, which promotes cellular cleansing. An 8/16 regimen (eating over an eight-hour period, fasting for 16) can be useful, but it must be tailored to each person. The time you eat also plays a role. Mice, which are nocturnal animals, show no benefits if they‚Äôre fed during their rest period. Something similar happens in humans: people who concentrate their only meal of the day at unsuitable times, like 2 a.m., have worse outcomes than those who distribute their diet more evenly throughout the day. For example, with lunch and dinner or breakfast and lunch. The circadian rhythm plays a role in how the body responds to eating and fasting.

Q. The brain is the organ that most defines us as a species. Dementia is an age-related disease, but the rate of mental illnesses like depression skyrockets after age 85. Furthermore, loneliness is increasing. Could all of this also be treated with drugs?

A.M. C. Exercise, diet, sleep, which is democratic, universal, cheap, and free, and yet no one sleeps enough in this country or anywhere else. Then there are two other components that until now haven‚Äôt been given much importance, which are precisely social relationships, social interactions, and their beneficial or harmful effect, depending on the nature of those relationships. You either use your brain or lose it. Just by listening to me, you‚Äôre making new brain connections.

There‚Äôs also a negative aspect, like stress and abuse. We see it in the lab. You put a bully mouse in the cage and in the other four, cellular cleaning decreases just from the stress. The last factor that‚Äôs been added recently is attitude. There seems to be a very good correlation because you have more endorphins. There are many biological benefits to seeing the glass half full. There‚Äôs a genetic component here, but also an environmental one. I come from a very positive family. My father, no matter what happened, always said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the tallest and the most handsome.‚Äù The key is that there‚Äôs constant stress that we don‚Äôt manage well. If you can at least find a way to manage it in a healthy way, that‚Äôs great.

Q: How long do we have to wait before we can get a blood or genetic test and be told what to take to treat aging?

A.M.C. Biomarkers of aging are already being researched, and their clinical application could arrive soon. Circulating factors are being sought to assess functions such as autophagy, mitochondrial health, and telomere status with a simple blood test, similar to current routine tests. The idea is to create a ‚Äúbiological signature‚Äù or barcode that reflects the aging status of each person. However, it will still take time before specific personalized interventions can be prescribed ‚Äî except in cases where clinically approved treatments already exist. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so excited about clinical trials, because the amount of information that will come back to the labs is tremendous.

J.L.A. The big problem with human aging is that we‚Äôre a slow-growing species; it‚Äôs much harder to experiment, and not just for ethical reasons. If you die at a certain age, it‚Äôs impossible to know: if I had done things differently, could I have lived longer? There‚Äôs only one solution, and that‚Äôs to be able to reverse aging. That will be the day when there‚Äôs no doubt that we control it. If it‚Äôs an epigenetic process, not a genetic one, then we can reverse it. Epigenetics is like software; we can change it. But genetics is hardware, and if it‚Äôs broken, there‚Äôs nothing you can do.

A.M.C. But that‚Äôs already been done. When you take an adult cell from an older person and reprogram it ‚Äî what we call an iPSC ‚Äî the epigenetic markers disappear. And you have a stem cell again. But you haven‚Äôt reversed aging, just the epigenetic markers.

Q. What do you think of initiatives like Altos Labs, funded by billionaires who want to find a cure for aging as soon as possible?

A.M.C. Billionaire investment in aging research, like at Altos Labs, isn‚Äôt a bad thing if it‚Äôs managed carefully. Although their interest is sometimes purely selfish ‚Äî wanting to stay young forever ‚Äî their contributions can benefit society as a whole by driving scientific advances. I don‚Äôt feel guilty about receiving money from these people because we know we can do something about aging. It‚Äôs better for them to spend it on this than on other things.

Q. Science is going through a very difficult time under Donald Trump. Is it affecting you?

A.M.C. It‚Äôs best not to comment directly on the situation, but I do want to convey a positive message. Scientists are trained to be resilient, and research will continue, one way or another. What worries me most is ensuring we don‚Äôt lose a generation of scientists. In Spain, cutting-edge science is done with very few resources, thanks to ingenuity and creativity. And that shows that resilience is possible. But we also need young people to see the enthusiasm, not just the complaints. The best is yet to be discovered, and science remains the best possible career.

Preterm Birth Risk and Second-Trimester Medical Termination,"TOPLINE:

Medical termination of pregnancy (mTOP) in the second trimester was considered safe and not significantly associated with the risk for future spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB).

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers conducted a single-centre cohort study to investigate the association between mTOP in the second trimester and the risk for subsequent sPTB in 1438 individuals who underwent an mTOP with mifepristone and/or misoprostol between 2008 and 2023.

The mean maternal age at the time of mTOP was 32.5 years; by December 2024, 1033 participants had a known subsequent pregnancy, and 405 did not.

Interpregnancy intervals were categorised as 0-3, 3-6, 6-12, 12-24, and more than 24 months; the gestational age at mTOP was 12 +0 -16 +0 , 16 +0 -19 +6 , and more than 20 weeks.

-16 , 16 -19 , and more than 20 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of sPTB before 37 weeks in subsequent pregnancies, whereas secondary outcomes included rates of preterm births before 28, 32, and 37 weeks; miscarriage; repeated terminations; and variations in birth weight.

TAKEAWAY:

The incidence rate of subsequent sPTB before 37 weeks was 4.7% among singleton pregnancies and 16.7% among multiple pregnancies.

Participants with a short interpregnancy interval (< 3 months) had a higher incidence rate of sPTB than those with an interval of 12-24 months (6.8% vs 3.2%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.2; P = .2).

The incidence rate of sPTB was 5.9% and 2.6% for mTOP conducted at gestational ages of more than 20 weeks and less than 15 weeks, respectively (aOR, 2.2; P = .07).

The rate of subsequent sPTB before 37 weeks after excluding participants with prior sPTB before 37 weeks was 4.1% among singletons and 17.4% among multiples; when cases with prior curettage were excluded, the rate was 4.5% among singletons and 20.0% among multiples.

A higher gestational age at mTOP was significantly positively associated with subsequent sPTB before 37 weeks (Œ≤ coefficient, 0.56; coefficient of determination, 0.31; P = .04).

IN PRACTICE:

""Second-trimester medical termination of pregnancy can be considered safe with regards to subsequent spontaneous preterm birth risk. As recommended following preterm and term birth, patient counseling should include the importance of allowing time for cervical remodeling to mitigate preterm birth risks, especially for those with a medical termination of pregnancy at higher gestational ages,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Annabelle L. van Gils, MD, Amsterdam UMC - location University of Amsterdam, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Meibergdreef, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It was published online on May 19, 2025, in American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

LIMITATIONS:

This study was limited by the exclusion of subsequent pregnancies. Those who underwent mTOP for social reasons were not routinely referred for follow-up. As this study was conducted at the sole tertiary academic centre for prenatal diagnostics in North Holland, the study sample was representative, which may have affected the generalisability of results.

DISCLOSURES:

This study received no specific funding. Two authors reported receiving grants for PTB research and being part of a non-profit organisation that supports PTB research. One author reported being an advisor for prenatal screening in North Holland and chairing a related review committee from 2016 to 2023.

Ketone Supplement Can Help Control Androgen Levels in PCOS,"TOPLINE:

Compared with placebo administration, supplementation with beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body, lowered levels of androgens and glucose in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting its potential as a non-pharmacologic approach for managing the condition.

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers in Denmark conducted a randomised crossover trial to examine the acute effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation on levels of androgens and glucose in women with PCOS.

They recruited 20 women (median age, 26 years) from a PCOS outpatient clinic and randomly assigned them to receive either a beta-hydroxybutyrate supplement (30 g) or taste-matched placebo.

Participants received either intervention in two doses: One at 10:00 PM the night before and another at 6:00 AM on the morning of blood sampling, after fasting overnight; after a minimum washout period of at least 3 days, each participant was administered the alternate intervention.

Participants avoided vigorous exercise and adhered to national dietary guidelines.

The primary endpoint was a change in the level of total serum testosterone.

TAKEAWAY:

Levels of 11-oxygenated androgens were significantly reduced with beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation compared with placebo administration (P < .05 for all).

Serum concentrations of testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione tended to be lower with beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation than with placebo administration, but the effects were not statistically significant.

Compared with placebo administration, beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation significantly reduced the level of fasting plasma glucose (mean difference, ‚àí0.5 mM; P < .001).

Higher baseline levels of testosterone were associated with greater testosterone-lowering effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate supplement, according to a correlation analysis.

IN PRACTICE:

""The reductions in these markers observed in our study suggest that BHB [beta-hydroxybutyrate] supplementation modulates the androgenic profile in women with PCOS, potentially offering a novel therapeutic approach for addressing hyperandrogenism,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Nikolaj Rittig, MD, PhD, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. It was published online on May 20, 2025 in European Journal of Endocrinology.

LIMITATIONS:

This study had limited statistical power for identifying smaller changes in testosterone levels. It focused on short-term effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation. Additionally, irregular menstrual cycles of participants prevented controlling for menstrual cycle phase during interventions and blood sampling.

DISCLOSURES:

This study was supported by The Aase og Ejnar Danielsen's Foundation and Novo Nordisk Foundation. The authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Google DeepMind Unveils AI Coding Agent AlphaEvolve,"Google DeepMind published a paper describing their AlphaEvolve coding agent. AlphaEvolve uses LLMs to discover and optimize algorithms across a range of domains, including hardware design, data center operations, and AI training.

AlphaEvolve uses an ensemble of LLMs, including both Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro, to generate and evolve programs that solve a user-defined problem; specifically, the user must specify an evaluation function that returns a set of scalar metrics. Google has applied AlphaEvolve to several problems in mathematics, engineering, and computer science with good results. One example is that AlphaEvolve discovered a more efficient algorithm for multiplying 4x4 matrices. Google also applied it to more than 50 problems in mathematics; AlphaEvolve re-discovered the state-of-the-art solution for 75% and found even better solutions for 20% of them. According to Google,

While AlphaEvolve is currently being applied across math and computing, its general nature means it can be applied to any problem whose solution can be described as an algorithm, and automatically verified. We believe AlphaEvolve could be transformative across many more areas such as material science, drug discovery, sustainability and wider technological and business applications.

The key idea in AlphaEvolve is to use LLMs for generating and evolving code. The system maintains a database of candidate programs that it has generated, and it uses them as context input to an LLM, along with prompts describing how to evolve the programs. Generated programs which have good results from the evaluation are stored in the database, and this loop continues until the best solution is found.

AlphaEvolve Architecture. Image Source: AlphaEvolve Whitepaper

Besides solving mathematical problems, Google has used AlphaEvolve to improve its own datacenter operations. It developed a new heuristic function used by Google's Borg task orchestrator. AlphaEvolve's solution was better than one discovered by deep reinforcement learning, and Google was able to recover 0.7% of its worldwide compute resources. AlphaEvolve also improved kernel tiling and FlashAttention operations in its AI training processes, resulting in 23% and 32% speedup respectively.

Users in a Hacker News discussion thread were generally positive about AlphaEvolve and brought up Google's recent AI track record:

People often forget that Google was behind Mu Zero, which IMO is the most important AI paper of the decade, not the Transformer one, because they effectively showed how models can learn how to search.

Writing on X, Simon Frieder, an AI researcher at the University of Oxford, chided DeepMind for its pattern of not fully open-sourcing their code:

DeepMind, even though they make sure all their releases are interesting scientifically, has a slightly spotty history of releasing full public code. For example, AlphaFold2 was released, but without training scripts. AlphaGeometry turned out to contain bugs. In both cases, open-source replacements were devised: OpenFold in the first case, and Newclid in the second...Because of this history, it could be that hidden bugs may be contained in AlphaEvolve, which do not make me trust the results it gives. In some cases, it will probably be easy to verify that the result it outputs is correct, but not in all cases. Note that this is different from LLM hallucinations, as here we have an automatic evaluator on which AlphaEvolve relies.

Although the model is not publicly available, academic researchers can apply for early access to AlphaEvolve.",https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/05/google-alpha-evolve/,Technology
Malicious Machine Learning Model Attack Discovered on PyPI,"A new campaign exploiting machine learning (ML) models via the Python Package Index (PyPI) has been observed by cybersecurity researchers.

ReversingLabs said threat actors are using the Pickle file format to conceal malware inside seemingly legitimate AI-related software packages.

In this recent incident, attackers published three deceptive packages: aliyun-ai-labs-snippets-sdk, ai-labs-snippets-sdk and aliyun-ai-labs-sdk, claiming to offer a Python SDK for Alibaba‚Äôs AI services.

These packages, however, contained no functional code related to AI. Instead, they deployed an infostealer payload embedded within PyTorch models, which are essentially zipped Pickle files.

Upon installation, the payload was activated from the initialization script.

The malware was designed to extract:

User and network information

The target machine‚Äôs organizational affiliation

Contents of the .gitconfig file

Notably, the malicious models also attempted to identify developers associated with the Chinese video conferencing tool AliMeeting, suggesting a regional focus.

PyTorch and Pickle: A Dangerous Combination

According to ReversingLabs, this incident highlights the growing threat posed by the misuse of ML model formats.

Pickle allows serialized Python objects to execute arbitrary code. As a result, it has become a preferred vector for attackers aiming to bypass traditional security controls. Two of the three identified packages used this method to deliver fully functional malware.

The researchers believe the appeal of ML formats is because many security tools do not yet support robust detection of embedded malicious behavior within such files.

‚ÄúSecurity tools are at a primitive level when it comes to malicious ML model detection,‚Äù said Karlo Zanki, a reverse engineer at ReversingLabs.

‚ÄúLegacy security tooling is currently lacking this required functionality.‚Äù

The infected packages were briefly available on PyPI and downloaded approximately 1600 times before removal.

While the exact method used to lure users remains unclear, social engineering or phishing is suspected.

As AI and ML tools become central to software development, this attack underscores the need for stricter validation and zero-trust principles in handling ML artifacts.

Introducing The Breitling Navitimer B02 Chronograph 41 Cosmonaute Scott Carpenter Centenary,"Flooded with seawater, the Cosmonaute prototype stopped running shortly after Carpenter was rescued. Breitling gave Carpenter and other NASA astronauts new versions of the watch that they and others continued to wear while on duty. Meanwhile, the original damaged prototype, the first Swiss wristwatch worn in space, was kept secure by the company head, Willy Breitling (and his family) for decades. With its highly marred dial, the watch resurfaced for the first time in 2022 as documented in this in-depth piece by Jeff Stein on Carenter and the Cosmonaute. As Stein rightly points out, the watch was designed to function not at sea but in space, and it did admirably.

For those with whom the story of the first Swiss wristwatch in space and the astronaut who helped create and wear it resonates deeply, the Carpenter Centenary might be the ultimate way to mark it. Rather than a flashy yellow gold case or exotic dial, it's the weighty (and costly) assurance of platinum and a functional, instrumental face ensconcing a watch that's mission-tested to get the job done. Call it highly capable luxury.",https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-breitling-navitimer-b02-chronograph-41-cosmonaute-scott-carpenter-centenary,Technology
AskBio Announces Publication of Complete Results of Phase 1b Trial of AB-1005 Gene Therapy in Participants with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease in Movement Disorders,"AB-1005 was well tolerated with no attributed serious adverse events in participants with mild or moderate Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) through 18 months post-gene transfer

Non-motor assessments remained numerically stable throughout 18-month follow-up in mild and moderate cohorts

Recruitment is ongoing in Europe and the United States for Phase 2 REGENERATE-PD trial to further explore the potential of AB-1005 in participants with moderate PD

Research Triangle Park, N.C., May 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

AskBio Inc. (AskBio), a gene therapy company wholly owned and independently operated as a subsidiary of Bayer AG, announced today the recent publication of the complete results of its Phase 1b trial of AB-1005, a glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) investigational gene therapy for the treatment of Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD), in Movement Disorders, an official peer-reviewed journal of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.1

‚ÄúThe exploration of the neurorestorative and neuroprotective potential of GDNF gene transfer is critical to advancing our understanding of AB-1005, which may one day be a groundbreaking treatment to slow the progression of Parkinson‚Äôs disease,‚Äù said Chad Christine, MD, Professor of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, and publication author. ‚ÄúThese encouraging results support further evaluation of this therapy in a randomized trial.‚Äù

The publication, which is available online, states that treatment with AB-1005 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events related to GDNF gene therapy in all 11 participants and is associated with numerical stability in clinical assessment readouts (mild cohort) and improvement (moderate cohort) in clinical assessments of motor function at 18 months post-gene transfer. In addition to these data, which were first presented in April 2024 at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, the publication notes that non-motor assessments remained numerically stable throughout the 18-month follow-up in the mild and moderate cohorts. Stability findings may be an indication of the potential for AB-1005 to positively affect disease progression.1,2

‚ÄúThese results support the continued study of AB-1005 as a potential gene therapy to slow the progression of Parkinson‚Äôs disease,‚Äù said Lila Collins, PhD, Associate Director of Portfolio Development & Review at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. ‚ÄúWe are pleased to have supported this important trial and look forward to AskBio‚Äôs Phase 2 REGENERATE-PD results, which will provide additional insights into the durability of the clinical response and potential disease-modifying effect of AB-1005.‚Äù

In February 2025, AB-1005 was granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration.3

AB-1005 is an investigational gene therapy that has not been approved by any regulatory authority, and its efficacy and safety have not been fully established or evaluated.

About Parkinson‚Äôs disease

Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease.4 It has a significant impact on a person‚Äôs daily life.4 In PD, the death of dopamine-producing nerve cells in the brain leads to the continuous loss of motor function.5 Symptoms include tremors, muscle rigidity, and slowness of movement.6 Additionally, people with PD experience non-motor symptoms, including fatigue and lack of energy, cognitive issues, and depression.6 Symptoms typically intensify over time and make everyday tasks increasingly demanding.6 The prevalence of PD has doubled over the past 25 years.4 Today, more than 10 million people worldwide are estimated to be living with PD.7 This makes it the world‚Äôs second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease.8 It is also the most frequent movement disorder.4,9 At present there is no cure, and current treatment options lack the holistic management of symptoms, so new therapies are needed.10

About the AB-1005 Phase 1b trial

In this Phase 1b, multicenter, multisite, open-label, uncontrolled trial, 11 participants were administered AB-1005 to the putamen via one-time bilateral convection-enhanced delivery. Participants were enrolled into two cohorts, mild (6 participants) and moderate (5 participants), based upon the duration and stage of their Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD).11 The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the safety and potential clinical effect of AB-1005 delivered to the putamen in participants with early/mild or moderate PD. The outcomes assessed at 36 months were incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as reported by the participants or assessed clinically by physical and neurological examinations, motor symptoms as reported via the Movement Disorder Society‚Äôs Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), and PD Motor Diary self-assessments, non-motor symptoms of PD, and brain dopaminergic network integrity as measured by DaTSCAN.11 These assessments will continue for up to five years.

About REGENERATE-PD

REGENERATE-PD is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of intraputaminal AB-1005 in the treatment of adults (45‚Äì75 years) with moderate-stage Parkinson‚Äôs disease. The trial will include an estimated 87 participants with trial sites located in Germany, Poland, United Kingdom, and United States.12 For more information about the REGENERATE-PD clinical trial, visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06285643 or visit askbio.com).

About AB-1005

AB-1005 is an investigational gene therapy based on adeno-associated viral vector serotype 2 (AAV2) containing the human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) transgene, which allows for stable and continuous expression of GDNF in localized regions of the brain after direct neurosurgical injection with convection-enhanced delivery.13,14 In nonclinical studies, GDNF has been shown to promote the survival and morphological differentiation of dopaminergic neurons.14,15 Recombinant GDNF has long been evaluated as a potential treatment for diseases, such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD), marked by progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.16 Through a combination of an investigational gene therapy and innovative neurosurgical delivery approach, we can now test the GDNF hypothesis in PD by getting this neurotrophic factor to these degenerating nigrostriatal neurons in a potentially more clinically relevant fashion.16

Tapo‚Äôs new $70 DL100 budget smart door lock is packed with features,"is a senior reporter who‚Äôs been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

TP-Link has announced a new budget-friendly electronic door lock joining its Tapo smart home line that‚Äôs launching today for $69.99. Despite the entry-level pricing, the new Tapo DL100 Smart Deadbolt Door Lock offers multiple unlocking methods, including a keypad, physical key, the Tapo mobile app, and voice commands through smart assistants like Amazon‚Äôs Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings.

The Tapo DL100 is about $10 cheaper than the Wyze Lock Bolt, which we selected as the best budget smart lock in our buyer‚Äôs guide. The DL100 doesn‚Äôt offer the convenience of a fingerprint scanner like the Lock Bolt, but it does come with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Wyze‚Äôs budget option is Bluetooth-only unless you pair it with the company‚Äôs video doorbell.

TP-Link estimates that it takes about 15 minutes to install the Tapo DL100, and battery life is expected to be up to seven months with Wi-Fi or up to 10 when only using Bluetooth. Image: TP-Link

With Wi-Fi turned on, TP-Link estimates that the DL100 will run for up to seven months on a set of four AA batteries, but that can be extended to up to 10 months when only using Bluetooth. Should the batteries die unexpectedly and you‚Äôve lost your key, the smart lock can be temporarily powered using a USB-C port.

For enhanced security, the DL100 supports a feature called pin masking, where you can enter your access code as part of a larger string of numbers to help obscure your PIN. You can also set up one-time codes for visiting guests or codes for service workers like repair technicians that only work during specific times of the day.",https://www.theverge.com/news/674405/tplink-tapo-dl100-smat-deadbolt-door-lock-wifi-bluetooth-battery,Technology
"International Oppo Reno14 shown in live image, here's when it's coming","Oppo launched the Reno14 and Reno14 Pro in China earlier this month, and a few days ago the company basically confirmed its plans to release them in other markets too, but not directly and with no release timeframe to speak of.

That's where today's leak comes in, claiming that the devices will land in India ""by the first week of July"". That's at the same time a very specific claim and a very vague one, but we'll take it since we don't have anything else to go by anyway.

The image above allegedly shows the India-bound Reno14, in Pearl White, which will be one of two colorways on offer in the country. The handset has a metal frame and a 3D pattern on the back.

Before we recap the specs of the Chinese models, do note that Oppo does sometimes like to modify the specs of the international Renos, and for all we know that could be happening again. The Reno14 has a 6.59-inch 1256x2760 120 Hz AMOLED screen, the Dimensity 8350 SoC, 12/16GB of RAM, 256GB/512GB/1TB of storage, a triple rear camera system (50 MP main, 50 MP 3.5x optical zoom telephoto, 8 MP ultrawide), and a 6,000 mAh battery with 80W wired charging.

The Pro has a 6.83-inch 1272x2800 120 Hz AMOLED screen, the Dimensity 8450 SoC, 12/16GB of RAM, 256GB/512GB/1TB of storage, a 50 MP main camera, a 50 MP 3.5x optical zoom telephoto, a 50 MP ultrawide, a 50 MP selfie camera, and a 6,200 mAh battery with 80W wired and 50W wireless charging.

Man from Surrey who stalked Katrina Ridley spared prison,"Man who stalked radio DJ avoids prison

A stalker from Surrey who left a radio DJ feeling ""unsafe and paranoid"" by repeatedly sending her letters, emails and gifts has been spared prison.

Keaton Adams, from Englefield Green, even went to the Heart radio studio in Leicester Square, London, in January this year asking to see presenter Katrina Ridley.

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard on Tuesday that Adams, 51, persistently tried to contact Ms Ridley between 1 November and 20 February, claiming he was in a relationship with her.

He pleaded guilty to one count of stalking involving serious alarm or distress and was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2r7vvy4e0o,Technology
OnePlus Ace 5 lineup gets two new members ‚Äì Racing and Ultra,"OnePlus Ace 5 lineup gets two new members ‚Äì Racing and Ultra

OnePlus Ace 5 and Ace 5 Pro have been on the smartphone market for almost half a year, but now the company refreshes the series with two more models ‚Äì Ace 5 Racing and Ace 5 Ultra.

These new smartphones are entirely different in specs and design, but keep the overall tone of the lineup - flagship performance at sub-flagship prices.

OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra

The name Ultra is literally translated as ""Supreme,"" and is technically the most powerful Mediatek-equipped OnePlus smartphone ‚Äì it comes with Dimensity 9400+. Here, we have a 6.83"" OLED display with 120 Hz refresh rate and a resolution slightly greater than Full HD+.

The chipset is coupled with 12 GB or 16 GB LPDDR5X RAM and 256 GB, 512 GB, or 1 TB UFS 4.0 storage. They are split into five different memory combinations to cover a wide price spectrum.

The OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra has a modest camera setup: a 50 MP main shooter with an f/1.8 lens, AF and OIS, coupled with an 8 MP ultra-wide-angle shooter with a 112-degree FoV. The front camera is a basic 16 MP shooter sitting behind a punch hole.

The phone comes with a dedicated side button that can be programmed to act as a shortcut to a predetermined set of apps ‚Äî alarm, torch, Night Mode, translator or AI.

OnePlus equipped the Ultra with a G1 connectivity chip that improves Wi-Fi speed and reliability by 33%, compared with competitors. It also has multi-layered cooling architecture with a 7,300 sq.mm vapor chamber.

The battery of the OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra has 6,700 mAh capacity. It comes with 100W wired charging support and also offers bypass charging. Just 10 minutes on the charger should offer 3 hours of gaming, while 39 minutes should fill the battery from 0 to 100%.



OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra

OnePlus comes in China with Oppo's ColorOS 15 and the in-house AI assistant, which is available only in the domestic market. Its colors are Blue, Black and Titanium Silver (with a cool striped design on the back), and the starting price is CNY2,499 (12/256 GB). The most expensive version is 16 GB RAM + 1 TB storage and costs CNY 3,799.

OnePlus Ace 5 Racing

OnePlus Ace 5 Racing comes with a Dimensity 9400e chipset. It has the same RAM and storage options as the Ultra, sans the 1 TB variant.

The cameras on the back are downgraded to 50 MP main and 2 MP B&W sensor. The selfie camera retains its 16 MP sensor.

Ace 5 Racing is built around a 6.77"" AMOLED panel with Full HD+ resolution and up to 120 Hz refresh rate.

OnePlus decided not to go with the dedicated G1 connectivity chip but at least brought a sophisticated cooling solution (although not as good as the one on the Ultra), including a 7,000 sq mm vapor chamber.

The Ace 5 Racing excels over the Ultra with battery capacity ‚Äì it brings the biggest cell in a OnePlus smartphone ‚Äì 7,100 mAh. It charges at ""only"" 80W and it comes with bypass charging.

This phone runs with ColorOS 15 and some AI features, like 4K upscaling in videos and erasing objects in photos.



OnePlus Ace 5 Racing

OnePlus Ace 5 Racing is available in White, Black, and Mint Green. Starting price is CNY1,799 for 12/256 GB.

We don't expect this phone to launch outside China, but we would love to be surprised by OnePlus and Oppo.

"Bilal made PM‚Äôs aide on crypto, blockchain","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has appointed Bilal bin Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, expanding the total strength of the federal cabinet to 61.

‚ÄúThe prime minister, in terms of rule 4(6) of the Rules of Business, 1973 read with serial number IA of Schedule V-A of the rules ibid, has been pleased to appoint Mr Bilal Bin Saqib, as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto, with the status of Minister of State, with immediate effect,‚Äù said a notification issued by the cabinet division.

Despite tall claims of austerity and belt-tightening, the PML-N-led federal government has swelled the size of the federal cabinet to 61. This includes as many as 31 federal ministers, 11 ministers of state, nine special assistants to the PM, five advisers and as many coordinators.

The finance ministry had earlier on Feb 25 ann¬≠o¬≠unced it was considering ‚Äúestablishing a National Crypto Council‚Äù to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. It later appointed Saqib as chief executive officer of the PPC.

According to a press release issued today, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching Bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.

Additionally, he will also facilitate ‚Äúlicensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers‚Äù and champion ‚Äúinvestor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth‚Äù in the country.

PBOC sets USD/CNY reference rate at 7.1876 vs. 7.1833 previous,"Yes, China has 19 private banks ‚Äì a small fraction of the financial system. The largest private banks are digital lenders WeBank and MYbank, which are backed by tech giants Tencent and Ant Group, per The Straits Times. In 2014, China allowed domestic lenders fully capitalized by private funds to operate in the state-dominated financial sector.

Unlike the Western economies, the PBoC uses a broader set of monetary policy instruments to achieve its objectives. The primary tools include a seven-day Reverse Repo Rate (RRR), Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF), foreign exchange interventions and Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR). However, The Loan Prime Rate (LPR) is China‚Äôs benchmark interest rate. Changes to the LPR directly influence the rates that need to be paid in the market for loans and mortgages and the interest paid on savings. By changing the LPR, China‚Äôs central bank can also influence the exchange rates of the Chinese Renminbi.

The PBoC is owned by the state of the People's Republic of China (PRC), so it is not considered an autonomous institution. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Committee Secretary, nominated by the Chairman of the State Council, has a key influence on the PBoC‚Äôs management and direction, not the governor. However, Mr. Pan Gongsheng currently holds both of these posts.

The primary monetary policy objectives of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) are to safeguard price stability, including exchange rate stability, and promote economic growth. China‚Äôs central bank also aims to implement financial reforms, such as opening and developing the financial market.

"Broad money climbs to Rs37.26tr as currency in circulation, deposits increase","Broad money supply (M2)‚ÄîPakistan‚Äôs principal measure of money in circulation‚Äîreached Rs37.26 trillion as of May 16, 2025, reflecting a week-on-week increase of Rs125.94 billion, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Since the beginning of the current fiscal year in July 2024, M2 has expanded by Rs1.38 trillion from Rs35.88 trillion recorded at the end of June 2024.

A breakdown of the components shows that currency in circulation rose by Rs42.78 billion on a weekly basis to reach Rs10.36 trillion. This represents a fiscal year-to-date (FYTD) increase of Rs1.21 trillion compared to Rs9.15 trillion at the end of June 2024. The share of currency in circulation as a percentage of M2 stood at 27.81% as of May 16, slightly up from 27.79% a week earlier and significantly higher than the 25.51% recorded at the start of the fiscal year.

Meanwhile, total deposits held with banks reached Rs26.85 trillion, marking a weekly increase of Rs85.63 billion. The FYTD increase in deposits now stands at Rs181.4 billion. These deposit figures exclude interbank placements, government deposits, and foreign constituents‚Äô deposits.

Currency in circulation refers to the physical cash‚Äînotes and coins‚Äîheld by the public and financial institutions. In contrast, M2 offers a broader view of the money supply. On the liability side, M2 comprises currency in circulation, all deposits of the non-government sector (including foreign currency deposits of residents), and other deposits with SBP. On the asset side, M2 is the sum of net domestic assets and net foreign assets held by the banking system, which includes both the SBP and scheduled banks.

M2 is widely used by policymakers and analysts in Pakistan as a benchmark for liquidity in the economy and is closely monitored for signs of inflationary pressures and changes in monetary conditions.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/27/broad-money-climbs-to-rs37-26tr-as-currency-in-circulation-deposits-increase/,Business
Amtex plans asset sale in Faisalabad to settle bank loans,"Amtex Limited (PSX: AMTEX) has disclosed plans to sell its land and buildings in Faisalabad as part of a debt settlement arrangement currently being negotiated with its lender banks.

NEPRA approves K-Electric‚Äôs bid results for 320 MW solar and hybrid power projects,"ISLAMABAD:

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) has approved K-Electric‚Äôs (KE) Bid Evaluation Reports (BERs) for two solar power projects and a 220 MW site-neutral hybrid project at the Dhabeji Grid Station. It also reviewed KE‚Äôs Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) integration plan.

According to the details, NEPRA granted its approval for a 100 MWp solar PV project at Bela and a 50 MWp solar PV project at Winder, both located in Balochistan.

KE had conducted separate competitive bidding processes for these projects and submitted the BERs on August 28, 2024, under Regulation 11 of the National Competitive Bidding Tariff Regulations (NCBTR) 2017. Master Textile Mills Limited (MTML) emerged as the lowest responsive bidder for both projects, having cleared technical evaluations and submitted the lowest financial bids.

In its decision, NEPRA stated that the bidding process complied with regulatory requirements and its own directives. It further instructed KE to ensure that any delays in the execution of generation or transmission projects‚Äîwhether caused by KE or the successful bidder‚Äîmust not result in any financial burden on consumers. This condition must be incorporated into the relevant project agreements.

Similarly, NEPRA approved the BER for KE‚Äôs 220 MWp (AC Peak, with a +20% allowance) hybrid power project at Dhabeji, noting compliance with applicable regulations and the project‚Äôs inclusion in both the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP) and the Power Acquisition Plan (PAP).

‚ÄúThis decision shall form the basis for regulatory processing of the tariff petition in accordance with the applicable laws, rules, and regulations,‚Äù stated NEPRA.

These approvals pave the way for the regulatory processing of tariff petitions for all three projects under the current legal and regulatory framework.

On the CTBCM integration front, NEPRA highlighted that KE‚Äôs participation in the new market model is contingent upon finalising commercial allocations of existing Power Purchase and Energy Purchase Agreements, and establishing a capacity invoicing mechanism for National Grid supply.

NEPRA emphasised that KE must align its operations with the CTBCM framework, including the central dispatch model, and finalise a revised tariff structure. KE is expected to file a new tariff petition reflecting these updates in accordance with market design requirements.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/27/nepra-approves-k-electrics-bid-results-for-320-mw-solar-and-hybrid-power-projects/,Business
Foreign investors withdraw $42.2 million from Pakistan‚Äôs treasury bills amid lower interest rates,"Foreigners purchased $1.183 billion in T-bills but withdrew $1.433 billion from July 1, 2024, to May 2, 2025

Foreign investors have pulled a net $42.2 million from Pakistan‚Äôs treasury bills (T-bills) as of May 2, 2025, following a decline in interest rates, according to the latest data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

The SBP on May 5 reduced its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 11%, the lowest in three years, following a series of rate cuts from a high of 22%. The policy rate has now been reduced by 11 percentage points since June 2024, further diminishing the appeal of Pakistan‚Äôs fixed income securities.

While foreign investment amounted to $9.998 million in T-bills, withdrawals totaled $52.208 million. This marks a continuation of the downward trend seen in previous months, with T-bills recording net outflows of $187.9 million in April and $197.4 million in March.

Between July 1, 2024, and May 2, 2025, foreign investors purchased $1.183 billion in T-bills but withdrew $1.433 billion, resulting in a cumulative net outflow of $250 million.

Analysts point to the reduction in interest rates as the main factor behind this trend, making T-bills less attractive to investors. Concerns about the gradual depreciation of the Pakistani rupee have also contributed to the persistent outflows.

Additionally, the geopolitical situation between Pakistan and India has added to investor uncertainty. A brief military conflict in early weeks of May, exacerbated concerns. Although the two nations agreed to a ceasefire on May 10, the conflict has strained investor confidence in Pakistan‚Äôs economy.

On a positive note, Pakistan received a $1.02 billion tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as part of its $7 billion loan program, pushing the country‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves to $11.45 billion.

The IMF‚Äôs next review is scheduled for the second half of 2025, during which the institution will discuss the terms for Pakistan‚Äôs 2026 fiscal year budget.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/27/foreign-investors-withdraw-42-2-million-from-pakistans-treasury-bills-amid-lower-interest-rates/,Business

Emirates Nuclear Energy Company and GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy sign partnership during World Utilities Congress 2025,"The Emirates Nuclear Energy Company (ENEC) and GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GVH) have signed an agreement at the World Utilities Congress in Abu Dhabi, to jointly evaluate the deployment of the BWRX-300 Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology internationally. The agreement enables ENEC and GE Vernova Hitachi to further cooperate following the signing of an agreement in 2023 on the sidelines of COP28 UAE to evaluate the technology as part of ENEC‚Äôs ADVANCE programme for advanced nuclear technology.

Nuclear energy is a crucial solution to meeting the current unprecedented demand for reliable, dispatchable, more sustainable power coming from a broad range of customers, including hyperscalers seeking to power data centers to support growth in the AI and technology sectors.

The agreement was signed during a private ceremony at the World Utilities Congress in Abu Dhabi, UAE. His Excellency Mohamed Al Hammadi, Managing Director and CEO of ENEC and Mav√≠ Zingoni, CEO of GE Vernova‚Äôs Power segment, exchanged signed agreements as part of their commitment to explore opportunities for international deployment by collaborating on a development roadmap to include site identification, licensing pathways, investment and commercialisation strategies and supply chain development.

His Excellency Mohamed Al Hammadi, Managing Director and CEO of ENEC, said: ‚ÄúAs we continue to power the UAE with clean, baseload electricity around the clock, we are glad to move to the next level of cooperation with GE Vernova Hitachi to accelerate the deployment of new advanced nuclear reactor technologies in the UAE and internationally. This agreement will bring together our complementary expertise to identify a clear roadmap for deployment, which is essential to ensure safe, efficient and quality-led nuclear delivery, as we have experienced here in the UAE. As global power demand continues to grow at pace, we look forward to advancing new solutions to meet this growth in a sustainable manner.‚Äù

Mav√≠ Zingoni, CEO of GE Vernova‚Äôs Power Businesses, said: ‚ÄúSmall modular reactors have an essential role to play in an energy secure future, and we are pleased to advance our collaboration with ENEC as the UAE seeks to be an early mover for nuclear innovation. With construction of the first BWRX-300 moving forward in Canada, collaborating with ENEC further strengthens our ties with the UAE and ability to deliver this technology and achieve a more sustainable energy future.‚Äù

As developer and operator of the four-unit Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE, ENEC brings significant expertise following the successful deployment of civil nuclear energy to power the UAE‚Äôs grid, aligned to the highest standards of international quality and safety. ENEC is a member of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) Atlanta Center and therefore is aligned on US operating standards and regulatory environment, combined with unique expertise in deployment, financing and integration. Today, 25 per cent of the UAE is powered by nuclear energy having brought each unit of the plant onto the grid in a highly efficient 7.9 years.

GE Vernova‚Äôs Nuclear Power business, through its global alliance with Hitachi, is a world-leading provider of nuclear fuel bundles, services, and advanced nuclear reactor designs. Technologies include boiling water reactors and small modular reactors, such as the BWRX-300, which is one of the simplest, yet most innovative boiling water reactor designs. On 8 May the Province of Ontario and Ontario Power Generation (OPG) approved the deployment of the first BWRX-300 at the Darlington nuclear site in Ontario, Canada. This milestone will make the BWRX-300 the first SMR to be built in the Western world and marked a significant step forward in advancing nuclear innovation.

Teams from ENEC and GE Vernova Hitachi will now work together to evaluate and develop a comprehensive roadmap for deployment of the BWRX-300. This forms part of ENEC‚Äôs ADVANCE Program, which was created to accelerate the evaluation and potential deployment of next generation nuclear technologies.

Beyond the Barakah plant, ENEC is focused on identifying investment, collaboration and deployment opportunities both in the UAE and overseas to support the rapid delivery of civil nuclear energy to drive energy security and sustainability through the provision of clean baseload electricity.",https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/en/energy/emirates-nuclear-energy-company-and-ge-vernova-hitachi-nuclear-energy-sign-partnership-during-world-utilities-congress-2025/,Business
Lenders seek court‚Äôs intervention over delayed payment in Azgard Nine land sale,"An application has been filed before the Lahore High Court by agent banks representing the creditors of Azgard Nine Limited (PSX: ANL), seeking enforcement of the Creditors‚Äô Scheme of Arrangement linked to the sale of the company‚Äôs Muzaffargarh Unit. The request concerns the sale of land and all associated plant, equipment, and installations located on the premises, with the transaction covering assets up to June 30, 2025.

The filing, disclosed to the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Thursday, has been made before the same company judge who previously sanctioned the court-approved Scheme of Arrangement. The agent banks have approached the court after the successful bidder failed to meet their payment obligations under the agreed sale terms.

Specifically, the banks have asked the court to order the buyer to clear the outstanding sale consideration within a brief, fixed timeframe. Should the default continue, the creditors have sought the court‚Äôs permission to terminate the transaction, refund the amount already paid, and initiate a fresh bidding process for the assets.

This action follows prior correspondence between the parties involved and is based on legal guidance from the creditors‚Äô counsel, Ahmed & Qazi. The legal team has advised that the transaction either be completed promptly or cancelled altogether to safeguard creditor interests.

In case of a re-auction, A&Q has recommended that only bids offering full upfront payment be accepted, with no consideration given to proposals involving deferred payment terms. The move is intended to prevent further delays in settlement and ensure a more secure and transparent disposal of the assets under the court-sanctioned arrangement.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/27/lenders-seek-courts-intervention-over-delayed-payment-in-azgard-nine-land-sale/,Business

May 27 (Reuters) - Oil giant Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) , opens new tab has set spread for its dollar-denominated 3-part bonds, fixed income news service IFR reported on Tuesday.

Aramco on Tuesday set the spread for the five-year debt sale at 80 basis points over U.S. Treasuries tighter than 115 bps over the same benchmark released earlier in the day.

Sign up here.

Meanwhile 10-year and 30-year portions' spread was set at 95 and 155 bps respectively over the same benchmark tightened from 130 and 185 bps, IFR said.

The proceeds from each issue of bonds will be used by Saudi Aramco for general corporate purposes, the company said in a bourse filing.

The debt deal, which is expected to be priced later in the day, will be benchmark-sized, which is usually considered to be at least $500 million.

Earlier this month, Aramco reported a 4.6% drop in first quarter profits, citing lower sales and higher operating costs as economic uncertainty hit crude markets.

Reuters reported last week that the oil giant is exploring potential asset sales to release funds as it pursues international expansion and weathers the impact of lower crude prices .

The company last turned to global debt markets in July last year when it raised $6 billion from a three-tranche bond sale.

Saudi Arabia, which is seeking funds to invest in new industries and wean its economy away from oil under its Vision 2030 plan , has long relied on Saudi Aramco to support economic growth.

Other Gulf issuers have tapped debt markets in recent months, braving a market turmoil caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies

They include Saudi Arabia's $925 billion sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi's renewable energy firm Masdar, which last week raised $1 billion with a green bond.

Government debt rises by Rs116bn in a week; FY25 net borrowing crosses Rs1.84tr,"The Government of Pakistan added Rs116.44 billion to its debt during the week ending May 16, 2025, taking total net borrowing for the ongoing fiscal year to Rs1.84 trillion, according to weekly estimates released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

Government borrowing is tracked under three broad categories: budgetary support, commodity operations, and others. Of the weekly increase, Rs115.7 billion was borrowed for budgetary support alone. Borrowing for commodity operations amounted to Rs59.15 million, while Rs677.01 million was borrowed under the ‚Äúothers‚Äù category.

Cumulatively in FY25, borrowing for budgetary support has now reached Rs2.14 trillion. However, this is partly offset by a net retirement of Rs298.47 billion under commodity operations and Rs1.1 billion under the others segment. These reductions reflect repayments or lower reliance on borrowing in these areas.

In terms of financing sources, the two key channels for budgetary support are the State Bank of Pakistan and scheduled commercial banks. So far in the fiscal year, the government has made a net repayment of Rs362.85 billion to the central bank. This figure includes fresh borrowing of Rs127.13 billion by the federal government, offset by repayments from provincial governments (Rs456.44 billion), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (Rs23.4 billion), and Gilgit-Baltistan (Rs10.14 billion).

In contrast, borrowing from scheduled banks remains substantial. The government has borrowed a net total of Rs2.5 trillion from scheduled banks during FY25. This includes Rs2.88 trillion borrowed by the federal government, while the provinces collectively retired Rs381.08 billion.

These weekly debt movements provide insight into the government‚Äôs financing patterns, with rising reliance on commercial banks for budgetary needs, alongside reduced dependence on central bank financing, which aligns with IMF-backed fiscal discipline and inflation control efforts.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/27/government-debt-rises-by-rs116bn-in-a-week-fy25-net-borrowing-crosses-rs1-84tr/,Business
Shares at PSX trim 600 points on budget announcement delay,"Bears continued their stampede on Monday at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as shares declined by more than 600 points in intraday trade.

The benchmark KSE-100 index declined by 886.10, or 0.74 per cent, to stand at 118,216.57 from the last close of 119,102.67 at 1:13pm.

At 3:04pm, the index decreased by 642.92 points, or 0.54pc, from the last close.

Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to ‚Äúdelay in budget announcement‚Äù, in addition to ‚Äúlack of clarity‚Äù on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ‚Äúconditions related to budget pushing investors to trim their exposure‚Äù.

Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, said, ‚ÄúThe market is consolidating ahead of the budget, with pressure on the oil sector following media reports of disagreements with the IMF over the circular debt resolution plan and the onset of rollover week.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe expect a rerating to the upside once there is clarity on key budgetary measures,‚Äù he added.

The government has delayed unveiling the federal budget from June 2 to June 10 due to inconclusive discussions with the IMF on taxation and fiscal measures.

Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.

Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, ‚ÄúThe market is concerned about delays in the release of circular debt payments to companies, as well as the potential rationalisation of tariffs in the upcoming budget.‚Äù

On a positive note, he highlighted the reduction in the primary surplus target to 1.6pc of GDP ‚Äî down from last year‚Äôs 2.1pc.

He said that this was ‚Äúexpected to give the government some fiscal space to avoid imposing harsh new taxes, unlike the pattern seen over the past three years‚Äù.

‚ÄúAlthough the room for significant relief is limited, we expect a relatively more people-centric budget, with emphasis on executing the comprehensive tax reforms initiated under the IMF programme over the last two years,‚Äù he said.

On Friday, the stock market had come under renewed selling pressure, forcing the index to close the outgoing in the red as jittery investors trimmed their positions amid fears of an unfriendly IMF-driven federal budget.

Contrary to the preceding week, when the benchmark KSE 100 index recovered a staggering 12,474 points thanks to a US-brokered ceasefire between two nuclear-armed neighbors, the PSX faltered due to lacklustre conditions as investors preferred to remain on the sidelines before the announcement of the budget 2025-26.

Indonesia to cut secondary reserve requirement for banks to 4%,"The Indonesian central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), is considering a reduction in the secondary reserve requirement for banks from 5% to 4%, effective from June.

This policy adjustment is set to free up Rp78.45tn ($4.84bn) in additional liquidity for the banking sector, reported Reuters.

WTI falls to near $61.00 as traders expect OPEC+ to increase Oil output,"WTI Oil price depreciates due to increased oversupply threats.

The OPEC+ may increase output by an additional 411,000 barrels per day for July this week.

Oil demand struggles due to rising US economic concerns, driven by the 'Sell America' sentiment.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price remains subdued for the second successive session, trading around $61.10 per barrel during the early European hours on Tuesday. Crude Oil prices depreciate as the OPEC+, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, could decide to raise output by an additional 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) for July at a meeting scheduled this week. The group may also reverse the remaining 2.2 million bpd voluntary production cut by the end of October, per Reuters.

On Monday, three sources within the OPEC+ group told Reuters that eight country members of the OPEC+, who pledged additional voluntary cuts, could meet on May 31. These members had already agreed to accelerate Oil output increases for a second month in June. OPEC+ is likely to decide output quotas in an online ministerial meeting on May 28, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said.

Additionally, the outlook for the Oil demand faces uncertainty amid growing concerns over the US economy. The 'Sell America' theme dampens the US markets‚Äô sentiment, driven by Moody‚Äôs downgrading the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1. The credit agency cited surging United States‚Äô (US) debt levels and Washington‚Äôs persistent gridlock over budget deficit solutions as an explanation for downgrading its US credit rating for the first time since 1917,

US President Donald Trump's ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù is set to be voted on in the Senate. The Bill is expected to raise the deficit by $3.8 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The Bill‚Äôs provisions, including tax cuts, spending increases, along raising the debt ceiling, could worsen US government finances and increase the risk of bond yields staying higher for longer. Higher bond yields can keep borrowing costs higher for consumers, businesses, and governments in the US, the largest Oil consumer, which is not good for crude demand.

The downside of the Oil prices could be restrained due to easing trade tension between the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) improves the traders‚Äô risk appetite. After Friday‚Äôs threat, Trump stepped back and decided to extend the tariff deadline on the European Union (EU) after having a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday. On Monday, the EU agreed to accelerate negotiations with the United States (US) to avoid a transatlantic trade war.

On Tuesday, US Durable Goods Orders, the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index, and the Conference Board‚Äôs Consumer Confidence report are scheduled to be released.

Nvidia Stock Braces For Impact Of China Trade Ban,"Wall Street estimates for Nvidia's (NVDA) fiscal first-quarter earnings have fallen sharply in the past week. Meanwhile, Nvidia stock has traded in a tight range ahead of the AI chipmaker's fiscal Q1 report, due late Wednesday.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect Nvidia to earn an adjusted 73 cents a share on sales of $43.34 billion for the quarter ended April 27. A week ago, Wall Street was modeling earnings of 88 cents a share on $43.3 billion.

Nvidia has warned that it will take a charge of ""up to approximately $5.5 billion"" for H20 inventory that the company was blocked from selling to China in April. The size of the actual Q1 charge will be a focus area of Nvidia's report.

An even bigger focus area is the artificial intelligence leader's sales guidance for its fiscal second quarter.

""Investors are quite concerned about the July (quarter) revenue guide being below expectations,"" Mizuho Securities trading-desk analyst Jordan Klein said in a client note Tuesday.

There is ""a lot of noise"" about revenue lost due to the H20 sales ban, he said. Most estimates have Nvidia losing $5 billion in revenue per quarter from the ban, ""but some think it could be as high as $8 billion"" a quarter, Klein said.

Nvidia's fiscal second-quarter revenue guide could be in the low $40 billion range vs. the current consensus estimate of $45.92 billion, Klein said.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported Monday that Nvidia plans to begin production as early as June of a new AI chip set for China that it hopes will be permitted for sale. The throttled processor will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM), Reuters said.

Nvidia Stock Nears Buy Point

In morning trades on the stock market today, Nvidia stock rose about 2% to 134.

Nvidia stock is in a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 137.40, based on IBD analysis. That base is within a larger consolidation pattern with a buy point of 153.13, according to IBD MarketSurge charts.

The Nvidia earnings report will be closely watched as a barometer for the AI infrastructure market.

""There is no company in the world more important to the markets and global investor sentiment than Nvidia with the Street laser focused tomorrow after the bell when we hear April (quarter) results/guidance from the Godfather of AI Jensen,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note Tuesday, referring to Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang.

""We believe overall AI chip demand around Blackwell continues to significantly outstrip supply,"" Ives said. ""The big question for tomorrow is what type of dent has the Trump H20/China business played in Nvidia's global demand and outlook going forward.""

Last Wave Of Negative News?

Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar on Tuesday reiterated his overweight rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of 150.

In a client note, Kumar said he expects Nvidia to miss the consensus revenue target because of the H20 ban and macroeconomic uncertainty. But he is bullish on its prospects for the second half of the year based on ramping capex investments by hyperscale cloud computing companies and new sovereign AI initiatives.

""We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for Nvidia this year,"" Kumar said.

Finance minister chairs high-level meeting to advance Pakistan‚Äôs transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy,"Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired a high-level meeting today at the Finance Division to discuss a host of measures for advancing Pakistan‚Äôs transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy.

The meeting brought together senior representatives from Pakistan‚Äôs financial sector, including commercial banks, development finance institutions (DFIs), regulators, and investment experts who form the core of the Committee established by the Minister to craft forward-looking recommendations to support Pakistan‚Äôs transition towards a digital and less cash-dependent economy.

Participants engaged in a comprehensive discussion on a series of key proposals aimed at fostering greater adoption of digital payments across the country. The group reached consensus on a range of measures intended to expand access to digital financial services, encourage the use of digital transactions, and reduce reliance on cash in everyday economic activity. Among the core areas of agreement was the need to ensure that digital payment options are widely available and accessible across various sectors, including retail, services, and public sector transactions. The participants supported steps that would encourage broad-based interoperability, leveraging Raast instant payments system in particular, leading to improved consumer choice in using digital payments platforms.

It was also agreed that creating a more level playing field between cash and digital transactions is essential, and that incentive structures should be rebalanced to make digital payments more attractive and cost-effective for both consumers and businesses. The importance of improving cost structures related to digital transaction infrastructure, including merchant acquisition and service provision, was highlighted as a priority to enable wider outreach, especially for small merchants and underserved communities.

Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb welcomed the Committee‚Äôs recommendations and emphasized that digitalization is central to Pakistan‚Äôs economic modernization agenda. He noted that increasing the footprint of digital payments will significantly enhance financial transparency, promote inclusion, and improve efficiency in both public and private sector operations. The Minister stressed that moving toward a cashless economy is not simply a policy aspiration, but a practical necessity for long-term fiscal resilience, competitiveness, and inclusive growth.

‚ÄúDigitalization is the foundation of a modern financial system. We must move with urgency and coordination to create a payments environment that is inclusive, interoperable, and focused on ease of use for every Pakistani citizen,‚Äù the Minister stated. He also underscored the importance of leveraging technology to simplify financial access for individuals and businesses while ensuring policy alignment across stakeholders. The meeting concluded with a directive from the Finance Minister for the Committee to prepare a detailed and time-bound roadmap for implementation of these initiatives, to be submitted to the Finance Division for further action and policy consideration.",https://dailytimes.com.pk/1307372/finance-minister-chairs-high-level-meeting-to-advance-pakistans-transition-to-a-digital-and-less-cash-dependent-economy/,Business

Dow rises 500 points after Trump delays steep EU tariff until July: Live updates,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the opening bell on May 27, 2025, in New York City.

Stocks rose Tuesday after President Donald Trump said over the holiday weekend that he agreed to delay tariffs of 50% on the European Union.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 523 points higher, or 1.3%. The S&P 500 gained 1.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite popped 2%.

Trump on Sunday said that he would push back the 50% levy deadline on the EU to July 9 following a request from Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. That comes after Trump last week proposed an import tax of 50% on the EU beginning June 1.

National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he expects to ""see a few more deals even this week."" U.S. consumer confidence data released Tuesday came in stronger than expected for May on hopes of trade agreements.

""We're still wary about chasing the SPX at these levels given complacency around two major areas of macro risk (tariffs and fiscal policy/yields) along with elevated equity valuations,"" wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge. ""Trump's most bombastic tariff threats ... won't become a reality, but he's still imposed substantial import taxes in just the last four months, and his administration is probably not finished.""

Tesla shares popped 4% after CEO Elon Musk said he was shifting his focus away from politics and back into his companies. Other tech-related names were also higher, including Nvidia , AMD , Apple and Microsoft .

Tuesday's action follows a losing week on Wall Street. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all slid more than 2% as Trump's calls for tariffs on the EU. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday in recognition of Memorial Day. Still, all three indexes are on track to end May's trading month in the green.

Traders this week will follow earnings from Okta due after the bell Tuesday, followed by companies such as Nvidia , Macy's and Costco later in the week. More than 95% of S&P 500 companies have reported this earnings season and almost 78% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to FactSet.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/26/stock-market-today-live-updates.html,Business
Thailand's exports grow 10.2 pct in April,"BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports grew for a tenth straight month in April, driven by industrial and agro-industrial shipments amid global trade tensions, official data showed on Monday.

Exports, a key driver of the Southeast Asian country's economic growth, rose 10.2 percent year-on-year in April to 25.62 billion U.S. dollars, slowing sharply from a 17.8 percent surge in March and marking the softest pace since last December, according to the Ministry of Commerce.

Ongoing export growth demonstrates the resilience of the Thai economy despite concerns over the impact of U.S. tariff measures, Commerce Minister Pichai Naripthaphan told a news conference.

Industrial shipments rose 16.6 percent in April, down from a 23.5 percent increase in the previous month, fueled by robust growth in sales of computers, gems and jewelry, and integrated circuits.

Exports of agro-industrial goods surged 9.1 percent, while agricultural products contracted 19.6 percent, dragged down by lower rice and fruit shipments.

The data also indicated that imports expanded 16.1 percent from a year earlier to 28.94 billion dollars in April, resulting in a trade deficit of 3.32 billion dollars.

For the first four months of 2025, exports climbed 14 percent to 107.15 billion dollars, while imports picked up 9.6 percent to 109.39 billion dollars, yielding a trade deficit of 2.24 billion dollars.

The kingdom is expected to continue facing risks from U.S. import tariffs in the second half of this year. Relevant government and private sector agencies have been holding ongoing discussions to prepare trade negotiation strategies and develop relief measures to mitigate potential impacts on businesses, the ministry said. ‚ñ†",https://english.news.cn/asiapacific/20250526/480a10b9a7db4a22837bcffe65b6647d/c.html,Business

The South Asian currency has experienced choppy moves over recent trading sessions, quickly reversing course from a fall past 86 last week to touch a two-week high of 84.78 on Monday and then shedding those gains in the face of a firmer dollar.

The rupee's very-near-tenor implied volatility - a gauge of future expectations - has also ticked up, with the spot-week gauge rising above 6%. The year-to-date average is around 4.5%.

The rupee seems to be ""settling into an 84.80-85.80 range and unless it breaks out on either side, the choppy moves may persist,"" an FX trader at a foreign bank said.

Despite the uptick on Tuesday, the dollar is on course to notch its fifth consecutive monthly decline against major peers as worries over uncertain trade policies and worries over fiscal health hurt appetite for U.S. assets.

Saudi's refining boom helps it weather oil price war,"Summary

Companies Saudi refining rises to seasonal all-time high in March

While kingdom's crude oil exports decline

Strong refining profits can offset revenue loss from weak crude prices

LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has been cranking up oil refining operations to capture strong profit margins, helping the kingdom offset revenue lost from declining crude prices and exports.

The world's top oil exporter has in recent years invested heavily in expanding and modernizing its refining and petrochemical capacity at home and overseas to meet growing demand for fuel and plastics while also securing outlets for its crude oil.

Sign up here.

Saudi Arabia has nine local refineries with a combined capacity of 3.33 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), accounting for roughly 3% of global demand, which are configured to process its domestically produced crude oil. It operates another 4.3 million bpd of refining capacity abroad, including in China, the United States and Malaysia.

The kingdom's domestic refineries processed 2.94 million bpd in March, the highest-ever volume for that month and only a smidgen below the record high of 2.96 million bpd in April 2024, according to data from the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI).

The 12% monthly increase in refining crude intake in March was 23% above the 10-year average for the same period. It correlates with a 12% month-on-month drop in Saudi crude exports to 5.75 million bpd in March, according to the data, highlighting the kingdom's flexibility between directly selling crude to other refiners and refining it itself.

Saudi refinery rates likely declined by around 200,000 bpd in April due to planned plant maintenance, but should remain at elevated levels ahead of peak summer demand season, according to Keshav Lohiya, CEO and founder of analytics firm Oilytics.

Saudi's refined product exports, which include diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and fuel oil, rose to a record 1.58 million bpd in March, before declining to 1.48 million bpd in April and 1.42 million bpd so far in May, according to data from ship tracking firm Kpler, likely reflecting refinery turnaround.

Saudi Arabia's refinery intake and crude exports

FLEXIBILITY

This integrated strategy offers Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) , opens new tab , the country's national oil company, an effective way to manage oil price volatility as refining margins - the profit made by processing crude oil into transportation fuels and chemicals - typically rise when feedstock prices decline.

It will likely prove valuable going forward after OPEC+, an alliance of major producing countries unofficially led by Riyadh and including Russia, started to rapidly unwind 2.2 million bpd of output since April.

The move to add a large volume of oil into an already well-supplied market concerned by the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on global economic activity put heavy pressure on oil prices, which dropped to around $65 a barrel from a high of $82 in mid-January.

Saudi Arabia and its allies will likely deepen the price war when they meet later this month by further accelerating the unwinding of their production cuts.

Refining margins have held strong so far this year despite the growing economic headwinds, benefiting from lower crude prices and healthy demand for diesel in particular. Benchmark Singapore refining margins are currently near their highest since February 2024 of around $8 a barrel, according to LSEG data.

Regardless of the possible impact of the trade wars, global fuel demand in the northern hemisphere typically peaks from June through early September, as motorists drive more over the summer while more air travel buoys jet fuel demand. This will therefore likely support refining margins in the coming months.

Saudi Aramco placed 28% of its crude oil production in domestic refining operations in 2024, up from 26% the previous year, according to its annual report. It also supplied 53% of the crude used by its joint venture refineries abroad.

The International Monetary Fund assessed that Saudi Arabia will need an average Brent oil price of around $90 a barrel in order to balance its national budget.

While crude prices are likely to remain at current levels or even lower for most of the year given the surge in supplies and demand uncertainty, the increased refining operations offer Riyadh an effective tool to manage oil price volatility and to better withstand a protracted price war.

Exports reached a record high in March 2025

Sethi gets the job done at Mitchell‚Äôs,"We here at Profit have been following the story of Mitchell‚Äôs very closely since 2019. Why would we not? It is a grand old Pakistani company, its products have made it a household name, it is owned by one of the most prominent business families in the country, and is currently headed by one of the most recognisable individuals in Pakistan: Najam Sethi.

Since at least 2019 it has been up for sale. The Mohsin family, which owns Mitchell‚Äôs and is part of the extended family of Syed Babar Ali and Syed Wajid Ali, decided to sell the company after running it for more than 70 years. A titan in its heyday, Mitchell‚Äôs could not keep up with technological advances and (more importantly) stiffer competition. It suffered a series of losses and the family decided it was time to make the most of their assets and hand Mitchell‚Äôs over to someone else.

But it didn‚Äôt quite go according to plan. Despite finding a buyer, the Covid-19 pandemic derailed the deal catapulting Mitchell‚Äôs into a five year period where it wasn‚Äôt clear whether they were after a turnaround or looking for another buyer. Central to all of this has been Najam Sethi. The former journalist who has served both as caretaker chief minister and as PCB chairman (both caretaker and official) is the son-in-law of S M Mohsin, the original patriarch that was running Mitchell‚Äôs.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/26/sethi-gets-the-job-done-at-mitchells/,Business
S. Korea's foreign currency deposit falls for 3rd month in April,"SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign currency deposit fell for the third straight month in April on an expanded use of the U.S. dollar funds, central bank data showed Monday.

The deposit, denominated in foreign currencies, dipped 0.68 billion U.S. dollars from a month earlier to 96.26 billion dollars at the end of April, after slipping 4.91 billion dollars in February and 1.59 billion dollars in March, according to the Bank of Korea (BOK).

The consecutive reduction was attributed to an increased use of the greenback to purchase raw materials and repay foreign debts.

Russia‚Äôs Economic Minister expects central bank to factor inflation slowdown into decisions,"Russia‚Äôs Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov on Monday called on the central bank to factor in slowing inflation when it meets next week to set interest rates, warning that the economy shows signs of ‚Äúhypothermia.‚Äù

The central bank has kept its key interest rate at 21% since October to combat persistent inflation, a policy that has restrained investment as the impact of rising military spending begins to ease.

President Vladimir Putin in March urged officials not to ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù the economy with high borrowing costs, a move analysts saw as a signal to start easing monetary policy.

Speaking in the State Duma, Russia‚Äôs lower house of parliament, Reshetnikov said recent inflation figures have been between 3% and 4% on an annualized basis. He expects May data to confirm the trend.

‚ÄúWe expect that the central bank will duly take this into account when taking decisions because we also see risks of economic hypothermia in the current regime,‚Äù Reshetnikov said.

The ministry projects annual inflation at 7.6% for 2025, a figure Reshetnikov called ‚Äúrealistic.‚Äù

Turkey detains 13 people in fintech Papara probe,"ISTANBUL, May 27 (Reuters) - Turkish authorities detained 13 people as part of an investigation into fintech company Papara over suspected money laundering and establishing a crime organisation, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Tuesday.

Papara, one of Turkey's fastest-growing fintech companies, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Yerlikaya said authorities determined that the company, which provides online money transfers, foreign-exchange transactions and bill-payment services for its 21 million users, was allowing users to open accounts to transfer illegal betting income.

A report by broadcaster TRTHaber said the detentions included Papara's founder and chairman, Ahmet Faruk Karsli.

Yerlikaya said ten companies, bank accounts and assets of the detained people were seized as part of the investigation.

According to a report by the financial crimes unit, more than 26,000 accounts were determined to have been used for illegal online betting and they made transactions worth 12.9 billion lira ($330 million), Yerlikaya added.

The central bank, which regulates payments firms, did not immediately comment on the investigation.

The company was founded in 2015 and the next year received an electronic money institution license from the regulatory agency BDDK, its website said.

It expanded abroad by purchasing Pakistan-based SadaPay last year and Spain-based Rebellion Pay in 2023. Its website said it had 21 million users as of last year.

PPR Holding owns Papara and its controlling share is held by Karsli. Calculations based on Trade Registry data show that as of May last year, he owned approximately 90% of the company.

"India's central bank seeks approval for overseas rupee lending to neighbours, sources say","NEW DELHI - India's central bank is taking another step to internationalise the rupee, seeking approval to allow domestic banks to lend the currency to overseas borrowers for the first time, two sources said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked the federal government to allow domestic banks and their foreign branches to lend Indian rupees to overseas borrowers to enhance the use and acceptability of the local currency in trade.

The proposal, which was sent to the finance ministry last month, suggests lending in rupees to non-residents can begin in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the sources said.

If successful, such rupee-denominated lending could be extended to cross-border transactions globally, one of the sources said.

According to Ministry of Commerce data, 90% of India's exports to South Asia were to these four nations in 2024/25, amounting to nearly $25 billion.

Currently, foreign branches of Indian banks are restricted to providing loans in foreign currencies and such loans are extended mainly to Indian firms.

The sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential. Emails sent to the Finance Ministry and the RBI requesting comment did not receive a response.

The central bank has been taking steps to increase the use of the local currency in global trade and investment.

As part of the strategy, RBI recently permitted the opening of rupee accounts for non-residents outside India.

Earlier this month, Reuters reported the RBI has sought government's approval to remove the cap on foreign banks with so-called vostro accounts buying short-term sovereign debt, to boost rupee-denominated investment and trade.

The RBI will open the foreign loans in rupees only for the purpose of trade, the sources said.

Currently, rupee liquidity is provided in other countries only through a limited number of government-backed credit lines or bilateral currency swap arrangements.

""The objective is to reduce dependence on such arrangements and instead allow commercial banks to provide rupee liquidity on market terms,"" the first source said, citing a communication from the central bank in April.

The second source said enabling easier access to rupee-denominated loans will help facilitate trade settlements in rupees and reduce exposure to foreign exchange volatility.

The government has received several requests from financial institutions to support strategic projects through rupee-denominated financing, the second source said.

India's experience with local currency pacts with the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and the Maldives, as well as Special Rupee Vostro Accounts used for trade with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, has underscored the need to deepen the availability of rupee liquidity, the source said.

If implemented, the policy would mark a major step toward integrating the rupee into the global financial system, positioning it as a more widely accepted currency for international trade and investment, the second source added.

why Scotland is experiencing 'weather whiplash',"Dry heat to torrential rain - enter the age of 'weather whiplash'

5 hours ago Share Save Christopher Blanchett Senior weather presenter, BBC Scotland Share Save

BBC Weather Watcher Wurzzle Threatening skies over Lossiemouth at the weekend as the long dry spell came to an end

After weeks of dry, sunny conditions in Scotland, torrential downpours over the bank holiday weekend marked a sudden change in weather. Barely a drop of rain was recorded over almost the entire month. March and April were far drier than normal, with May seeing only 4% of the normal rainfall by the middle of the month. This flip between extremes has introduced a new phrase to our forecasting vocabulary - weather whiplash. Some scientists believe we will have to get used to the idea that our weather will see wild swings from one extreme to another over short periods of time because of climate change.

Pendulum of change

The settled spell was caused by persistent blocked weather patterns, with high pressure dominating. The jet stream - a fast-flowing current of air - helped lock high pressure in place, deflecting low pressure systems and rain elsewhere. Before the weather turned last weekend, Scotland had only recorded 41% of its usual spring rainfall, with just seven days left of the season. This switch is driven by a warming world speeding up the water cycle and allowing the atmosphere to hold more water. So when it does rain, the rain is heavier, which in turn can lead to flooding. We know that our weather will continue to become more extreme, because global temperatures are rising due to human-induced climate change. Spring is the fastest warming season in the UK across all four nations. So when the sun is out, the temperature will be higher than historical records.

BBC Scotland Weather The jet stream in an omega block pattern, locking high pressure overhead the UK

Blocked weather patterns are a natural part of our weather variability but they help increase the weather extremes created by a warming world. However, climate scientists are not in agreement that we'll see more blocked patterns in the future. One school of thought is that a warming Arctic makes the jet stream more ""wavy"", allowing high pressure to become stuck and the blocking to occur, but an increase in blocking events isn't supported by the climate models used to predict future trends. Climate scientist Dr Matt Patterson, from the University of St Andrews, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""In terms of how it is changing, that is something scientists are not really sure about. ""There is no clear trend with climate change as far as we can tell in the observations so far and that's because there is a lot of variability from year to year that contributes to our weather.""

Good and bad for business

Kate Carter-Larg has run the Cheesy Toast Shack in St Andrews since 2015

In reality, the dry spring comes as a double-edged sword. At the Cheesy Toast Shack on the East Sands of St Andrews, the dry weather has been a boon for business, with trade up 30% compared with May last year. Owner Kate Carter-Larg said: ""Last spring was a little on the wet side and the weather has definitely helped this year. We've just been incredibly busy - midweek, weekends - it's just busy all the time. It's a huge factor that the weather has been so dry."" But our farmers and growers have been struggling in the dry conditions. Water scarcity also prompted a plea to the public from Scottish Water, to actively think about our water usage in order to conserve reserves.

Climate scientist Dr Matt Patterson warns of further episodes of weather whiplash

Dr Patterson said: ""With climate change we can expect that we're going to see more periods of variability in weather. ""It's often been called 'weather whiplash', the idea that we have some very prolonged dry periods, but then also when it rains, it rains more heavily"".

Warmer atmosphere holds more water

One of the impacts of our warming climate is that the atmosphere holds more water. For every one degree increase in global temperature, our atmosphere holds 7% more water. As a result, the natural water cycle is sped up and intensified.

"First report of Stemphylium lycopersici keratitis, a complex corneal infection case - Journal of Ophthalmic Inflammation and Infection","This current case highlights rare and important issues in the field of infectious diseases; (1) the mixed infection caused by a rare fungus and a virus, and (2) the mNGS examination can rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and reveal changes in pathogen dominance. For the former issue, corneal scraping mNGS identified the fungal species S. lycopersici, contributing to the first reported case of keratitis caused by this pathogen. S. lycopersici, originally isolated from Solanum lycopersicum in Japan [18], belongs to the order Pleosporales (subclass Dothideomycetes), the family Pleosporaceae, and the genus Stemphylium, which is a significant plant pathogen [19]. Stemphylium spp. are important fungi characterized by dark filamentous spores and have a wide global distribution. Stemphylium spp. hold a crucial place in the classification of hemipteran fungi and can be distinguished into 28 species based on gene regions. Woudenberg et al. have meticulously detailed the morphology of S. lycopersici in their study (Fig. 4) [20]. We hypothesized that S. lycopersici may have been introduced into the immunosuppressed cornea through an external foreign body. Additionally, the patient‚Äôs cornea was damaged by stone chips, which could alter the immune barrier on the ocular surface. This injury may have facilitated the development of mixed polybiotic infectious keratitis in this case. We believe that using mNGS examination of corneal scrapes to identify fungal species could help identify this new pathogen of keratitis.

In general, it is difficult for ophthalmologists to quickly identify pathogens and detect changes in the prevalence of pathogens in mixed infections by standard examination and clinical review. In instances of refractory infectious keratitis where empirical treatment fails, several possibilities should be considered: (1) incorrect diagnosis of the pathogen and subsequent drug selection, (2) the presence of a mixed infection involving multiple microorganisms, (3) evolving microbial resistance, (4) systemic diseases that compromise ocular surface immunity, and (5) patient drug adherence was poor. We eliminated (4) and (5) as causes since the patient lacked a history of systemic diseases affecting the immunity of the ocular surface and demonstrated consistent adherence to their medication regimens. In the case of (1) and (2), the mNGS should be used to quickly identify all pathogens, enabling timely adjustments to the treatment plan. For scenario (3), the mNGS can discern the pathogenicity of microorganisms in infectious keratitis and pinpoint dominant shifts, thus facilitating prompt medication modifications. Furthermore, if feasible, microbial scraping should be performed for drug susceptibility testing. In this case, given the negative corneal scrape culture result, we used IVCM to diagnose a fungal infection and administered the appropriate empiric treatment. However, the inability to identify the specific type of fungus and diagnose mixed infections led to suboptimal treatment results. Thus, mNGS testing was conducted, which precisely identified the types of pathogenic microorganisms and diagnosed mixed infection. When presenting the results, the scientific method of mNGS minimizes the influence of contamination and eliminates the influence of the common ocular flora, significantly enhancing the reliability of the findings.

Challenges in clinical and microbiological diagnosis

IK is an ophthalmic emergency that can cause significant corneal damage, leading to corneal opacification, and is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide [1]. Early identification of the pathogen responsible for corneal infection allows rapid and optimal treatment, preventing irreversible corneal damage and significantly improving the chances of full recovery. However, clinical features are not specific to the type of microbial keratitis, making the early accurate diagnosis of IK challenging [21]. Consequently, both in vivo and in vitro tests are necessary to aid in the early diagnosis of IK. Corneal smears and cultures remain the gold standard for IK diagnosis; however, these methods lack sensitivity. Fungal cultures are particularly time-consuming, and some rare species require two weeks or more to confirm the presence or absence of pathogen growth [22]. Other widely used diagnostic modalities, such as direct microscopy, IVCM, and histopathological examination, also have significant drawbacks. These methods often result in a low positive rate for early diagnosis and may overlook mixed infections, preventing patients from receiving effective treatment promptly and leading to severe consequences [23]. The emergence of newer technologies highlights the inadequacies of older methods, which do not provide accurate and timely diagnoses necessary to guide treatment and preserve patients‚Äô vision.

The patient had previously been treated in a local hospital before seeking care in our facility. Due to the inability to identify the pathogen, empirical treatment with levofloxacin eye drops tobramycin eye drops, and ganciclovir ophthalmic gel was administered. This approach masked clinical symptoms and delayed the accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease. A corneal scraping culture yielded negative results and an IVCM examination suggested a fungal infection. Although many clinical features of fungal keratitis overlap, identifying the specific fungal species is crucial to guide the appropriate treatment. There are no distinct ocular signs to differentiate the rare fungal keratitis caused by S. lycopersici from other types of fungal keratitis. Empirical treatment with 5% natamycin eye drops was initiated, but the response was poor. Subsequent corneal scraping mNGS identified a mixed infection caused by S. lycopersici and human alphaherpesvirus 1.

Challenges in clinical treatment

Broad-spectrum topical antibiotics are commonly used by clinicians to treat corneal infections of unknown etiology [24]. However, its extensive use alters the microbial spectrum and the respective antibiotic susceptibility patterns, potentially increasing the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria that cause disease [25]. AMR has become a major public health threat in the 21 st century, driven by various factors, including diagnostic uncertainty leading to inappropriate antibiotic use [26]. In the current ‚Äòpost-antibiotic‚Äô era, clinicians must exercise greater caution when choosing antibiotic therapy [27].

Ray et al., in their SCUT trial, discovered that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bacteria isolated from patients with IK who had been pretreated with topical fluoroquinolones was 3.48 times higher than in those who had not received such treatment [28]. A subgroup analysis of the Mycotic Ulcer Treatment Trial I (MUTT I) also revealed that patients with IK treated with topical antifungal medications experienced a mean increase in MIC of 2.14 times per year, even after adjusting for pathogen factors [29]. Emerging technologies such as mNGS and artificial intelligence-assisted platforms improve the microbiological diagnosis of IK [30, 31], thus improving treatment and reducing the risk of AMR.",https://joii-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12348-025-00505-6,Business

KFC has announced plans to create 7,000 new jobs across the UK and Ireland as rival fast food chicken chains such as Wingstop threaten to take a bigger bite of the market. The fried chicken firm is investing nearly ¬£1.5bn over five years, part of which will be spent on new restaurants in ""key locations"" such as Ireland and north west England, where it opened its first-ever British restaurant 60 years ago in Preston. Consumers in the UK and Ireland spend billions of pounds in fried chicken chains every year. KFC revealed its plan as competitors expand in Britain and Ireland, including Popeyes, famed for catering singer Beyonc√© and rapper Jay-Z's wedding in 2009.

It said it will plough nearly ¬£500m into 500 new sites as well as upgrading existing shops. It currently has more than 1,000 restaurants across the UK and Ireland, the majority of which are operated by franchisees. The fast-food chain said the 7,000 new jobs it expects to create in the UK and Ireland will include servers, kitchen-based roles and managers. It will invest in its supply chain to ""strengthen long-standing relationships"" such as with Pilgrim's Europe, which is based in Warwick, and McCormick in Buckinghamshire which makes the fast-food firm's gravy, the company added. KFC is by far the largest fried chicken chain in Britain. But in recent years, smaller competitors have been growing including America's Wingstop which, in December last year, sold its UK arm to US private equity firm Sixth Street for ¬£400m. Wingstop currently has around 57 franchised sites in the UK and plans to open another 20. Meanwhile, Popeyes UK has 65 restaurants across the UK and Ireland after a big expansion last year when it opened 33 shops. According to market research firm Kantar, Britons spent about ¬£2.8bn on fried chicken from fast food shops in the year to 20 April. Dave's Hot Chicken - the US brand which counts rapper Drake and actor Samuel L Jackson among its backers - opened its first restaurant in Britain last year, located in London, and plans to launch a further 60 shops in the UK and Ireland.

May 27 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce firm PDD Holdings (PDD.O) , opens new tab saw first-quarter net profit fall 47% to 14.74 billion yuan ($2.05 billion) as its domestic platform suffered from intense local competition and its international business was hit by global trade uncertainty.

U.S.-listed shares of the company fell more than 17%.

Sign up here.

""[PDD's] massive bottom line miss is due to much weaker than expected operating margin, likely impacted by U.S. tariffs,"" said Mscience analyst Vinci Zhang.

Despite deep price cuts by retailers and government stimulus measures to boost spending, a prolonged property crisis in the world's second-largest economy has cast a shadow over consumer spending in China, even on PDD's Pinduoduo, which has out-performed peers with its low-price focus.

""Slower domestic consumption, intensified competition, and global trade frictions are weighing on growth,"" said U.S. Tiger Securities analyst Bo Pei.

""Elevated costs reflect strategic promotional activities and advertising spend to support merchant sales, it's aimed at supporting the platform's long-term ecosystem health but sacrifices near-term profitability.""

Alibaba's quarterly revenue also missed estimates , although JD.com notched a beat , buoyed by a government trade-in scheme focused on its strongest categories, including home appliances and electronics.

Meanwhile, a tit-for-tat tariff escalation between the U.S. and China, followed by a temporary 90-day de-escalation, has generated widespread uncertainty for global business Temu.

""Radical change in external policy environments such as tariffs has created significant pressure for our merchants,"" PDD chairman and co-ceo Chen Lei told analysts in a post-earnings call.

The U.S. earlier this month slashed tariff rates for goods from China valued at under $800 entering the country under the ""de minimis"" provision, a trade exemption leveraged by Temu to avoid tariffs and keep prices low.

""Our global business is working with merchants across regions to bring stable prices and abundant supply to strengthen our operations in the markets we serve,"" Chen said, reiterating Temu's desire not to raise prices in the face of tariffs and its strategic shift to seeing more orders fulfilled by local merchants.

PDD reported revenue of 95.67 billion yuan ($13.30 billion) for the quarter ended March 31, compared with analysts' average estimate of 102.51 billion yuan, according to data compiled by LSEG.

May 27 (Reuters) - Salesforce said on Tuesday it would buy Informatica for about $8 billion, betting on the data management platform to sharpen its competitive edge in the booming artificial intelligence market.

Buying Informatica, in its biggest deal since its nearly $28 billion acquisition of Slack Technologies in 2021, would help Salesforce expand its data management tools as it doubles down on AI-powered products.

The deal would also allow Salesforce to tighten control over how business data is managed and used, an essential step as it races to embed generative AI deeper into its products.

""Salesforce and Informatica will create the most complete, agent-ready data platform in the industry,"" said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, adding the deal will strengthen its position in the $150 billion-plus data enterprise market.

The company has been offering AI agents - programs that can handle routine work without human supervision - to businesses for recruiting and customer service. It has closed more than 1,000 paid deals for ""Agentforce"", its platform for creating AI-powered virtual representatives.

Salesforce is paying $25 for each share of Informatica, a premium of about 30% to Informatica's closing price on May 22, the day before news of renewed talks emerged.

Informatica shares were 5.8% higher in premarket trading at $23.86, while Salesforce was up 1.2%.

Salesforce expects to close the deal in early next fiscal year starting February through a mix of cash and new debt. The deal is expected to boost its operating margin from the second year after closing.

Scotiabank analysts said the move could help Salesforce catch-up with software rivals as ""data management software is now most often sold as part of mega-vendor tool kits"".

The business software company has been a prolific dealmaker, buying data analytics firm Tableau Software in 2019 for $15.7 billion in stock, and Slack in 2021 in its biggest deal.

Those deals drew scrutiny in 2023 when activist investors, including ValueAct Capital and Elliott Management, pressed for changes to improve profitability.

"Lynx: Risk priced in, Nvidia could surprise to the upside","Investing.com -- Nvidia stock could break out to new highs following its earnings report, according to Lynx Equity, which has raised its price target from $140 to $160.

‚ÄúAfter a couple of quarters of inline results, we think NVDA has the potential to provide upside to muted investor expectations,‚Äù the firm wrote in a new note.

Lynx, which had previously highlighted concerns such as heating issues with the GB300 GPU and tariff exposure, now sees many risks as ‚Äúpriced in.‚Äù

The analysts credited Nvidia‚Äôs ability to ‚Äústeamroll through‚Äù challenges ranging from delayed product launches and trade restrictions to grid limitations and scaling constraints.

They cited new growth vectors and capacity expansion as reasons for optimism.

‚ÄúGB200 has overcome its teething issues,‚Äù Lynx said, pointing to a sharp ramp-up in production at Foxconn (SS:601138) and a $500 million new manufacturing campus in Texas. Additionally, a resurgence in CoWoS capacity build at TSMC signals recovery in Nvidia‚Äôs supply chain.

Lynx also highlighted Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äústealth entry‚Äù into Edge AI through its partnership with MediaTek, calling it a significant long-term opportunity, particularly in automotive and enterprise markets.

Tariff risks appear largely mitigated, according to the firm. ‚ÄúNVDA has in place a carefully crafted strategy to avoid nearly all tariffs,‚Äù Lynx said, noting recent exemptions from the U.S. Commerce Department and Nvidia‚Äôs diversified manufacturing footprint.

Lynx also pointed to ‚Äúmega deals‚Äù such as the $500 billion Stargate project and new funding for AI clients like OpenAI and CoreWeave as likely to support future revenue growth.

‚ÄúNVDA is on the verge of breaking out of the range and is headed for new highs,‚Äù Lynx concluded, maintaining a bullish stance into the earnings release.

IMF raises UK growth forecast as it warns on tax and spending,"IMF raises UK growth forecast as it warns on tax and spending

6 minutes ago Share Save Emma Haslett Business reporter, BBC News Share Save

The UK economy is forecast to grow slightly more than previously expected in 2025, but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the Chancellor must stick to her rules on tax and spending. In its annual health-check for the economy, the IMF predicted growth of 1.2% this year, rising to 1.4% in 2026. It said an economic recovery was ""under way"" after a boost in the first three months of the year. The forecast from the influential body comes just over a month after it downgraded its expectations for the UK from 1.6% in 2025 to 1.1%.

Luc Eyraud, the IMF's UK mission chief, said growth had been ""very strong"" in the first three months of the year. Official figures released this month revealed the economy was boosted by increases in consumer spending and business investment, but the figures were during the period before the US imposed import tariffs and UK employer taxes increased in April.

The IMF praised the government's planning reforms and infrastructure investment plans, which it said would increase growth ""if properly implemented"". But it added that a ""high level of global uncertainty, volatile financial market conditions, and the challenge of containing day-to-day spending"" mean the Chancellor Rachel Reeves will face ""difficult choices"" to balance taxation with spending in the long term. It suggested some changes to the government's self-imposed fiscal rules, including cutting the number of times the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) produces an assessment of the UK's finances to once a year, rather than twice. Fiscal rules are self-imposed by most governments in wealthy nations and are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. The government has repeatedly said its rules are ""non-negotiable"". The chancellor has two main rules which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy: day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing

to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029/30.

Global trade tensions

Growth next year will be weighed down by global trade tensions, including less activity among the UK's trading partners, the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs and ""persistent uncertainty"", the IMF's report said. The combination of these factors will reduce next year's growth to the tune of 0.3% by 2026, it said. But the IMF pointed to trade agreements the UK has struck with countries like EU, India and the US, saying they demonstrated the government's commitment to ""establishing a more predictable environment for UK exporters"". Chancellor Reeves welcomed the report, saying that the government's trade deals were ""protecting jobs, boosting investment and cutting prices"". But Mel Stride, shadow chancellor, said Reeves had ""already fiddled her fiscal targets to allow her to borrow hundreds of billions more over this parliament"". ""In a context where the Chancellor's credibility is already in tatters, changing the goalposts a second time would run real risks with market confidence,"" he added.

Rising inflation

The report comes just over a month after the IMF cut its expectations for UK growth this year to 1.1%, which it said was due to an increase in borrowing costs, US tariffs and a hit from inflation. It added at the time that it expected UK inflation to slow to 2.2% by 2026, close to the Bank of England's 2% target. Earlier this month the Office for National Statistics said inflation rose unexpectedly in April to 3.5%, from 2.6% in March. On Tuesday, the IMF said this rise in inflation will last until the second half of this year, returning to target ""later in 2026"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jy0jk231o,Business

Higher beef and fresh produce prices has pushed UK food inflation to an annual high, according to industry data, with the boss of one steakhouse chain telling the BBC the cost of the meat had risen by a fifth. Food prices rose 2.8% in the year to May, the highest annual rate since May 2024 when food inflation was 3.2%, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarkets and other retailers. Farming industry experts said beef prices in particular have been rising due to high demand and low supply caused by lack of government support. Tomas Maunier, co-founder of steak restaurant chain Fazenda, said the meat industry faced ""tough times"".

Mr Maunier, whose Brazilian-inspired steakhouse chain has eight restaurants across the UK, said his firm had passed on about 2% of increased running costs to customers. ""Beef in particular has gone up about 20% in the last 12 months. A big chunk of that has happened in the last six but businesses cannot pass it all on to our guests,"" he added. Mr Maunier added that an increase in production costs and an increase in the national minimum wage was also pushing up overall costs, which could be passed onto consumers. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), said competition between supermarkets had previously been keeping the price of beef down, so it was only a matter of time until customers were hit by cost increases. ""Its not surprise. The farm price for beef has been going up and up to the point that its now at record levels,"" Mr Allen said. He warned it was a ""real struggle"" for the industry to keep up with demand for beef, and claimed that ""government schemes have not supported production but environmental schemes instead"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg41n37990o,Business

Why Europe is pivoting back to nuclear ‚Äî one of its most divisive energy sources,"A European-wide shift to nuclear power appears to be gathering momentum as countries hedge their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.

In just the last few weeks, Denmark announced plans to reconsider a 40-year ban on nuclear power as part of a major policy shift, Spain reportedly signaled an openness to review a shutdown of its nuclear plants and Germany dropped its long-held opposition to atomic power.

The renewed European interest in nuclear shows how some countries are hedging their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.

The burgeoning trend appears to be driven, at least in part, by some of the costs associated with renewables, notably solar and wind technologies.

""Solar and wind are still the cheapest and fastest way to drive the green transition, and that remains our focus. But we also need to understand whether new nuclear technologies can play a supporting role,"" Lars Aagaard, Denmark's minister for climate, energy and utilities, told CNBC via email.

The renewables-heavy Scandinavian country said in mid-May that it plans to analyze the potential benefits and risks of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind technologies.

Denmark's government, which banned the use of atomic energy in 1985, added that it does not plan a return to traditional nuclear power plants.

""We have no recent experience with nuclear power, and we lack the necessary knowledge regarding safety and waste management. That's why we must begin a serious analysis ‚Äî not to replace solar and wind, but to see whether new nuclear can complement our energy system in the future,"" Aagaard said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/europe-pivots-back-to-nuclear-in-pursuit-of-more-energy-independence.html,Business

Air Liquide strengthens its Home Healthcare activity with two acquisitions in Germany,"Air Liquide is continuing its development in Germany with the acquisition of two outpatient intensive care companies, intensivLeben GmbH and AP-Sachsen GmbH. With this operation, the Group broadens its presence in the care market. Air Liquide accompanies more than 220,000 patients in Germany, with a growing presence over the last 25 years. As part of its Healthcare activity, a Group‚Äôs growth driver, Air Liquide already supports worldwide 2.1 million people at home living with a chronic disease and has made Home Healthcare activities one of its strategic development priorities.

The newly acquired entities operate in the Saxony region, one of the most densely populated regions of Eastern Germany, between Berlin and Bavaria where the Group is already present, with a strong footprint in the local market. Both companies are operating in the German outpatient intensive care business, focusing on Community Care centers, shared apartments for severe patients who suffer from chronic respiratory insufficiency, craniocerebral trauma, and neuromuscular diseases. They provide personalized intensive care to patients, and manage 9 centers, thanks to 138 employees, including around 100 nurses.

Air Liquide has been present in Germany in Home Healthcare for 25 years and has successfully managed to become one of the major players in the Community care sector, with 20 Community Care centers across Germany. Drawing on its experience and expertise in personalized support for patients, Air Liquide, through these acquisitions, is strengthening its geographic footprint and its presence in services for chronic patients.

EnduroSat raises $49 million to mass produce larger satellites,"TAMPA, Fla. ‚Äî Bulgaria-based microsatellite specialist EnduroSat announced $49 million in funding May 27 to ramp up production of a larger and more capable class of satellites.

The company currently builds 12‚Äì15 cubesats per month that weigh no more than 36 kilograms, founder and CEO Raycho Raychev said, but plans to significantly increase this rate with its 200-500kg Gen3 Endurance platform.

The new funds will help build out a 17,500-square-meter facility in Sofia, Bulgaria‚Äôs capital, designed to produce up to 60 satellites per month by the end of the year.

It represents a major step up for the 10-year-old venture, which has delivered around 150 satellites since launching its first in 2018.

‚ÄúWe are already seeing significantly larger demand for 2025/2026,‚Äù Raychev said via email. ‚ÄúThe plan is to deliver 120 units, minimum, by the end of the year.‚Äù

EnduroSat plans to fly two Gen3 Endurance validation missions in 2025: one to demonstrate propulsion technology and another to test an Earth observation system using in-orbit processing and a multispectral payload.

Gen3 Endurance is designed to provide up to 3.5 kilowatts of power and 2 gigabits per second of downlink capability. By comparison, existing EnduroSat satellites top out at about 50 watts and 1 Gbps.

According to Raychev, the Gen3 line was also designed from the start with accelerated manufacturing in mind.

‚ÄúA huge amount of work went into simplifying the mechanical elements and the electronics, which allows a single [assembly, integration and test] AIT engineer to assemble and test a full ESPA-class satellite in just one day,‚Äù he said, referring to the platform‚Äôs compatibility with adapters used for secondary payloads on launch vehicles.

‚ÄúThis makes the Endurance class of satellites perfect for responsive space programs, defense, and other applications that require a short time to orbit and integration across multiple satellites with diverse missions.‚Äù

Raychev said demand is mainly coming from constellation programs in the remote sensing domain, including both optical and synthetic aperture radar, amid growing interest in broadband connectivity.

Initial customer deliveries for Gen3 Endurance are slated for the end of this year, with first deployments expected in the early second quarter of 2026.

Founders Fund, the venture capital firm backed by billionaire Peter Thiel and an early investor in SpaceX, led the 43 million euro funding round.

Chinese premier calls for advancing China-Vietnam comprehensive strategic cooperation,"Chinese premier calls for advancing China-Vietnam comprehensive strategic cooperation

KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang said here Tuesday that China will work with Vietnam to advance their comprehensive strategic cooperation toward higher quality and deeper levels.

Li made the remarks during a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on the sidelines of the ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)-China-GCC (the Gulf Cooperation Council) Summit.

Li said that not long ago, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a successful state visit to Vietnam, where the two sides agreed to accelerate the building of a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance in line with the overarching goals characterized by ""six mores.""

China stands ready to work with Vietnam to implement the outcomes of the visit, maintain high-level exchanges, deepen mutual political trust and enhance mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, said Li.

Noting that the current international situation sees an increasing number of destabilizing and uncertain factors, Li said that China will remain committed to opening-up and development, and looks to strengthen communication and cooperation with Vietnam, jointly uphold international fairness and justice, safeguard the global economic and trade order, and protect the common interests of the Global South countries.

For his part, Pham Minh Chinh noted that Xi paid a successful state visit to Vietnam last month. He said Vietnam will join hands with China to actively implement the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties and the two countries, intensify high-level exchanges and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields.

The Vietnamese side congratulates on the success of the first ASEAN-China-GCC Summit, he said, voicing his country's willingness to work with China to pursue more practical achievements in tripartite cooperation.

Best Stock: A former high flyer that's coming back into favor because of improving fundamentals,"(This is The Best Stocks in the Market , brought to you by Josh Brown and Sean Russo of Ritholtz Wealth Management.) Josh: This week we saw a few new names hit the Best Stocks in the Market list, including a former high-flier that's now come back into favor. Remember the Snowflake (SNOW) IPO? It was a big deal. At the time it came public in September 2020, investors were clamoring for cloud computing stocks and the whole tech sector was red hot. SNOW debuted with the largest IPO in history, raising $3.36 billion. And, if you can believe it, the stock turned out to have been underpriced. Shares were sold to the public at $120, but ultimately got as high as $300 on the first day of trading. The company had a valuation of $75 billion right out of the gate, a multiple of approximately 75 times its projected full-year revenues. Fun fact ‚Äî it's the first time I can remember seeing Berkshire Hathaway on the holders list of a hot new issue (Warren Buffett's firm sold its whole position out a long time ago). If you thought that was the top, you hadn't seen anything yet. By Thanksgiving the following year, Snowflake hit its all-time high of $401.89 per share. That was the top of the post-pandemic tech rally. From there, a collapse of over 70% to an all-time low of $107 in September 2024. Shareholders who had held from the IPO for the next four years were now looking at unrealized losses after all that volatility. But then a funny thing happened. The CEO stepped back and took the chairman's role while promoting internally to bring the company's head of AI into the C-Suite and onto the board of directors. The company put together a few quarters in a row of 25% growth and has begun surprising The Street to the upside. Sean's going to share some more of the details below. This is a stock that's still 50% below its all-time high, but is now a double off of the lows and climbing. In my experience, institutions don't mind paying up for a growth company as the story improves. Snowflake's biggest drawback for most professionals has been its long and winding path to full-year profitability. Best stocks stats As of 5/27/2025 morning, there are 106 names on The Best Stocks in the Market list. Top sector ranking: Top 5 Best Stocks by Relative Strength: New addition: Snowflake Sean: SNOW was added to our Best Stocks in the Market list last week following a great earnings report. SNOW is classified as ""IT Services"" below, but software and software-related names are the strongest stocks in the market right now: The IGV (iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF) is up 2% in total return YTD and up 20% the past year, nearly doubling the performance of the Nasdaq 100 over the past year. Snowflake is a cloud-based data platform that enables organizations to store, manage, and analyze large volumes of data seamlessly across multiple cloud environments. You can't do anything useful in AI if your data isn't clean, organized and unified. Snowflake helps companies optimize their data for machine learning, model-training and other stuff. SNOW went public in September of 2020, right before we experienced the largest tech bubble since the dot-com implosion in 2001. It's had a difficult couple of years if you look at the chart since its inception: As a trader, it's not the prettiest chart. But if it can maintain support around the $190 level, which has been an important level of resistance for the stock going back to 2022, there's some room for the bulls to push this higher. Looking at the chart below since inception, on a weekly basis the stock has been in a down trend, but after this latest earnings beat, both moving averages are beginning to flatten, showing possible support for an uptrend: As an investor, the stock has not been rewarding, but the fundamentals are improving. During last week's earnings call, SNOW beat on the top and bottom lines, with revenue growing 4%, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes, also known as operating earnings) growing 74%, and EPS growing 13%, all YoY. (Data via Quartr.) SNOW now has 606 companies paying them over $1 million dollars in revenue each, a figure which is up 27% year over year. Gross margins have expanded from 59% in 2021 to 67% today, bringing the company closer to its profitability goals. SNOW's net revenue retention rate hit 124% for the quarter, which is a great sign. A net revenue retention rate of 124% means that, on average, a company's existing customers are spending 24% more, even after accounting for customer churn, downgrades, cancellations, etc. In simpler terms, if you started the year with customers paying $100, by the end of that year, the same group is paying you $124 without adding any new customers. It means existing customers are growing in value to the business. SNOW is not profitable on an operating basis, but with the growth and scale they are achieving, profitability on an operating and net income basis is on the horizon, which would mean higher stock prices with it. Risk Management Josh: Below, I'm zooming in on the last 100 days or so because SNOW has run right back up to its February highs. It's just had a parabolic move higher after reporting great results. Ideally if I'm a trader, I'm waiting for an entry on a low volume pullback into the 190s. I'd use $175 - $180 as my line in the sand. That area should hold as support. If it doesn't, the setup didn't work. Longer-term investors can give it a wider berth and let the flat-lining 200-day (now at $160) turn up a bit. I'd be using that as a stop, checking it on a weekly closing basis each Friday. I was going to end this by saying ""Stay Frosty"" but then I'd have to slam my own fingers in a desk drawer just to distract from the cringe. And nobody wants that. Good luck out there, Sean and I will return later in the week.

Summary

Companies Merz and ministers sharpen criticism of Israel

Germany traditionally feels special responsibility after WW2

German public opinion also shifting

More than half of Germans oppose weapons exports, survey finds

TURKU, Finland/BERLIN, May 27 (Reuters) - Germany's foreign minister threatened unspecified measures against Israel on Tuesday and said Berlin would not export weapons used to break humanitarian law, as he and Chancellor Friedrich Merz delivered their most severe rebuke yet over Gaza.

Germany, along with the United States, had long remained in support of Israel's conduct since the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas, even as Israel became increasingly isolated internationally. Its about-turn comes as the European Union is reviewing its Israel policy and Britain, France and Canada also threatened ""concrete actions"" over Gaza.

Sign up here.

Speaking to broadcaster WDR, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul warned Germany's historic support for Israel must not be instrumentalised, as massive air strikes and shortages of food and medicines had made the situation in Gaza ""unbearable"".

Earlier, Merz criticised air strikes on Gaza as no longer justified by the need to fight Hamas and ""no longer comprehensible"", in comments at a press conference in Finland.

While not a complete rupture, the shift in tone is significant in a country whose leadership follows a policy of special responsibility for Israel, known as the Staatsraeson, due to the legacy of the Nazi Holocaust.

It also reflects a broader shift in German public opinion.

""Our committed fight against anti-Semitism and our full support for the right to exist and the security of the state of Israel must not be instrumentalised for the conflict and the warfare currently being waged in the Gaza Strip,"" Wadephul said.

""We are now at a point where we have to think very carefully about what further steps to take,"" he said, without giving further details.

""Where we see dangers of harm, we will of course intervene and certainly not supply weapons so that there will be further harm,"" he said, adding that no new weapons orders were currently under consideration.

The shift in government stance comes after calls among the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, to halt arms exports to Israel or else risk what the move's backers say would be German complicity in war crimes.

WORSENING HUNGER

Attacks on Gaza killed dozens in recent days, and the population of more than 2 million faces worsening hunger and starvation , according to a U.N.-backed monitor.

Efforts to revive a short-lived ceasefire that broke down in March have made little visible progress , although one regional diplomat said talks were still going on in Doha and there remained a chance for a deal.

The German comments are particularly striking given that Merz won elections in February promising to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on German soil in defiance of an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC).

""The massive military strikes by the Israelis in the Gaza Strip no longer reveal any logic to me - how they serve the goal of confronting terror,"" Merz said in Turku, Finland.

He did not reply to a question about German weapons exports to Israel. Wadephul said arms deliveries were a matter for a security council presided over by Merz, whose meetings are confidential.

The foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a further request for comment on whether Germany's next step could include halting weapons shipments.

The chancellor is due to speak to Netanyahu this week.

In his office, Merz has a picture of Zikim beach, where Hamas fighters arrived on boats during their rampage in 2023 that killed around 1,200 people - a picture he had hanging for years previously in his parliamentary office.

Israel's ambassador to Berlin, Ron Prosor, acknowledged German concerns on Tuesday but made no commitments.

""When Friedrich Merz raises this criticism of Israel, we listen very carefully because he is a friend,"" Prosor told the ZDF broadcaster.

Merz's comments come on top of a groundswell of opposition to Israel's actions. A survey by Civey, published in the Tagesspiegel newspaper this week, showed 51% of Germans opposed weapons exports to Israel.

More broadly, only 36% of people in Germany view Israel positively, a survey by the Bertelsmann Foundation found in May, down from 46% in the last survey in 2021.

Only a quarter of Germans recognise a special responsibility towards the state of Israel, while 64% of Israelis believe Germany has a special obligation, the survey found.

Hajj flight returns twice for pilgrim denied boarding,"JEDDAH: The journey of a Libyan pilgrim, Amer Al Mahdi Mansour Al Gaddafi, to perform Hajj ‚Äî the fifth pillar of Islam ‚Äî has become a powerful tale of faith, determination, and what many are calling divine intervention.

Amer Al Mahdi Mansour Al Gaddafi‚Äôs unwavering resolve to reach the holy city of Mecca has inspired countless Muslims around the world.

A Challenging Start

Amer‚Äôs ordeal began at the airport, where he was stopped at immigration due to a security delay linked to his surname ‚Äî Al Gaddafi ‚Äî associated with the late Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi.

Despite his repeated pleas, the flight captain decided to depart without him, citing security protocols and tight scheduling. But what happened next transformed Amer‚Äôs struggle into a symbol of divine will.

Two Returns, One Message

Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft developed a technical issue and was forced to return to the airport. Following repairs, the flight took off again ‚Äî only to experience a second malfunction that required another emergency return.

Divine Intervention?

Following the second incident, the captain announced, ‚ÄúI swear I won‚Äôt fly again unless Amer is with us on this plane.‚Äù

Authorities quickly cleared Amer for travel, and on the third attempt, the flight departed with him on board.

A Story of Faith

Amer‚Äôs journey has been interpreted by many as a sign of divine will and answered prayer. He said, ‚ÄúI only wanted to go to Hajj‚Ä¶ And I believed that if it was written for me, no force could prevent it.‚Äù

For many, his experience reflects a core Islamic belief: that no one can withhold what Allah grants, and no one can grant what Allah withholds. Titles, power, and influence hold no value in the face of divine will.

The Spiritual Significance

Hajj is obligatory for all adult Muslims who are physically and financially able to undertake the journey. Yet, Muslims also believe that the ability to perform Hajj is not solely dependent on personal effort ‚Äî it is a divine invitation, granted only to those chosen by Allah.

Amer‚Äôs story, shared widely on social media, has become a moving reminder of this belief ‚Äî and a testament to the strength of faith and persistence.",https://arynews.tv/hajj-flight-returns-twice-for-pilgrim-amer-al-gaddafi-denied-boarding/,World
52 killed in Israeli Gaza carnage,"Trucks carrying aid are seen at the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza. Photo: REUTERS

Rescuers said Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 52 people on Monday, 33 of them in a school-turned-shelter, as European allies ramped up their criticism of Israel.

While the war raged on, mediators presented a proposal for a 70-day ceasefire and hostage-release deal to Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian source said.

The territory's civil defence agency said many of the casualties at the school in Gaza City were children, while the Israeli military said the site was housing ""key terrorists"".

Moreover, a US-backed foundation tasked with supplying aid to Gaza made a faltering start on Monday, with no clear sign that it had distributed promised supplies, a day after its chief unexpectedly stepped down.

The aid plan, which has been endorsed by Israel but rejected by the UN, is unfolding amid fierce Israeli attacks on the enclave.

With food still critically short after a nearly three-month blockade, Washington says it is working to restore a ceasefire more than 19 months into the war, but progress is elusive.

A Palestinian official said Hamas had agreed to a US proposal for a truce and the release of 10 Israeli hostages, but an Israeli official dismissed the proposal as unacceptable, denying it was Washington's.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff rejected reports that Hamas had agreed to his proposal, telling Reuters that what he has seen is ""completely unacceptable"".

Israel has faced a mounting international outcry this month, including from Western allies, as it launched a new offensive in Gaza, already largely destroyed by Israeli bombardment and where the population of 2 million is at risk of famine.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which intends to use private contractors working under a broad Israeli security umbrella, said it would begin deliveries on Monday, with the aim of reaching one million Palestinians by the end of the week.

""We plan to scale up rapidly to serve the full population in the weeks ahead,"" it said in a statement.

The Switzerland-registered foundation has been heavily criticised by the United Nations, whose officials have said the private company's aid distribution plans are insufficient for reaching the more than two million Gazans.",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2548021/52-killed-in-israeli-gaza-carnage,World
"Spain hosts European, Arab nations to pressure Israel","MADRID: The international community should look to sanction Israel to stop the conflict in Gaza, Spain‚Äôs foreign minister said, ahead of a Madrid mee¬≠ting of European and Arab nations on Sunday to urge a halt to Israeli offensive.

Countries Israel had long counted on as allies have been adding their voices to growing international pressure after it expanded its operations against Hamas.

Madrid is hosting 20 cou¬≠ntries as well as international organisations with the aim of ‚Äústopping this war, which no longer has any goal‚Äù, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Alb¬≠a¬≠res told France Info radio.

Humanitarian aid must enter Gaza ‚Äúmassively, unimpeded, neutrally, so that it is not Israel who decides who can eat and who cannot‚Äù, he said.

The meeting, which also includes representatives from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, will promote a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

A previous such gathering in Madrid last year brought together countries including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye as well as Euro¬≠pean nations such as Ireland and Norway that have recognised a Palestinian state.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- A regional association of Southeast Asian nations is set to hold a three-way summit Tuesday with China and six Gulf countries in what officials called an effort to bolster economic resilience as they grapple with global volatility and U.S. tariffs.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, opening a summit in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur between the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council, said a stronger ASEAN-GCC relationship would be key to enhancing interregional collaboration, building resilience and securing sustainable prosperity.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang will join the two blocs in their first such meeting later Tuesday, as Beijing seeks to present itself as a reliable ally to the region.

‚ÄúI believe the ASEAN-GCC partnership has never been more important than it is today, as we navigate an increasingly complex global landscape marked by economic uncertainty and geopolitical challenges,‚Äù Anwar said.

Malaysia is the current chair of ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Sabah said the two blocs, which held their first summit in Riyadh in 2023, would build on their momentum to deepen cooperation and ‚Äúimprove our ability to face crisis.‚Äù He said the GCC is ASEAN's seventh largest trade partner, with total trade reaching $130.7 billion in 2023.

The GCC comprises the oil-producing nations of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Anwar said last week the GCC already has strong links with the U.S. and ‚Äúwants to be close to China too.‚Äù

ASEAN has maintained a policy of neutrality, engaging both Beijing and the United States, but U.S. President Donald Trump's threats sweeping tariffs came as a blow. Six of the bloc's members were among the worst hit, with tariffs between 32% and 49%.

Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs in April for most of the world, and this month struck a similar deal with key rival China, easing trade war tensions. Anwar is seeking an ASEAN summit with Trump on the tariffs.

Collins Chong Yew Keat, a foreign affairs, strategy and security analyst with Universiti Malaya, said ASEAN is seen as tilting towards China and has failed to take strong action against Beijing's aggression in the disputed South China Sea. ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping claims with China, which asserts sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea.

While relying on U.S. defense support, ASEAN is increasing reliance and partnership with China and other U.S. rivals, Chong said.

‚ÄúIf this continues under the current Trump administration, it will create further room for Washington to distance itself from the region, which will spell disaster and create an even deeper Chinese presence,‚Äù he said.",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/asean-opens-summit-gulf-nations-china-amid-us-122215115,World
Hamas agrees to US proposal on Gaza ceasefire,"CAIRO: Hamas has agreed to a proposal by US special envoy Steve Witkoff for a Gaza ceasefire, a Palestinian official close to the group told Reuters on Monday, paving the way for a possible end to the war with Israel.

The new proposal, which sees the release of ten hostages and 70 days of truce, was received by Hamas through mediators.

‚ÄúThe proposal includes the release of ten living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in two groups in return for a 70-day ceasefire and a partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip,‚Äù the source said.

The proposal also sees the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners by Israel, including hundreds serving lengthy prison terms.

There was no immediate comment from Israel.

On March 18, Israel effectively ended a January ceasefire agreement with Hamas and renewed its military campaign in Gaza. Hamas and allied factions began firing rockets and attacks two days later.

Hamas has said it is willing to free all remaining hostages seized by its gunmen in attacks on communities in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and agree to a permanent ceasefire if Israel pulls out completely from Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would only be willing to agree to a temporary ceasefire in return for the release of hostages, vowing that war can only end once Hamas is eradicated.",https://www.brecorder.com/news/40364831/hamas-agrees-to-us-proposal-on-gaza-ceasefire,World
Russia pummels Ukraine with drone strikes,"KYIV: Russia launched a record number of drones against Ukraine and killed 13 people across the country, officials said on Sunday, even as Kyiv and Moscow completed their biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war.

Ukraine‚Äôs emergency services described a night of ‚Äúterror‚Äù as Russia launched a second straight night of massive air strikes, including on the capital Kyiv.

The renewed strikes came after Russia launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 drones overnight Friday to Saturday, which wounded 15.

Kyiv seeks more global pressure on Moscow

Ukraine‚Äôs military said on Sunday it had shot down a total of 45 Russian missiles and 266 attack drones overnight. Air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said a total of 298 drones were launched, adding that this was ‚Äúthe highest number ever‚Äù.

Four people were reported dead in Ukraine‚Äôs western Khmelnytskyi region, four in the Kyiv region, and one in Mykolaiv in the south. Emer¬≠gency services said 16 people were also injured in the Kyiv region, including three children.

‚ÄúWithout truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,‚Äù Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. ‚ÄúThe silence of America, the silence of others around the world only encourages Putin,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúSanctions will certainly help.‚Äù

EU‚Äôs diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called for ‚Äúthe strongest internatio¬≠nal pre¬≠ssure on Russia to stop this war.‚Äù

Russia, meanwhile, said its strikes were aimed at Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äúmilitary-industrial complex‚Äù and said it had brought down 110 Ukrainian drones.

Macron shrugs off viral shove from wife during Vietnam visit,"France's President Emmanuel Macron was pushed in the face by his wife Brigitte Macron as the couple arrived in Vietnam to begin a tour of Southeast Asia, at Noi Bai International Airport, in Hanoi, Vietnam, May 25, 2025. ‚Äî Reuters

French President Emmanuel Macron downplayed an incident involving his wife, Brigitte, during their arrival in Vietnam for a Southeast Asia tour.

A video captured Brigitte appearing to push Macron in the face as he left the presidential plane late Sunday, prompting him to take a step back before he regained composure and waved to onlookers.

The couple, married since 2007, descended the steps together, with Brigitte notably refusing to take her husband's arm.

""I was bickering, or rather joking, with my wife,"" Macron told reporters in Hanoi. ""It's nothing.""

He cautioned that this was not the first time in recent weeks that the content of videos of him had been twisted by people he described as ""crackpots"".

Macron cited a video shared on social media that showed him removing a crumpled white object from a table on a train during a visit to Ukraine.

Some social media users suggested ‚Äî without providing evidence ‚Äî that the object was a bag of cocaine. Macron said it was a tissue and his office accused France's enemies of spreading fake news.

Earlier on Monday, an Elysee official said of the latest video: ""It was a moment when the president and his wife were relaxing one last time before the start of the trip by having a laugh.""",https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1315777-macron-shrugs-off-viral-shove-from-wife-during-vietnam-visit,World
"First Thing: Gaza influencer, 11, among dozens of children killed by recent Israeli strikes","Good morning.

Eleven-year-old Yaqeen Hammad, Gaza‚Äôs youngest social media influencer, is among the dozens of children killed by Israel in recent strikes as its forces intensify their military offensive across the Palestinian territory.

Known for her bright smile and volunteering efforts, Yaqeen was killed on Friday night after Israeli forces shelled the al-Baraka area of Deir al-Balah in northern Gaza, amid intense fighting in the region.

Yaqeen and her older brother, Mohamed Hammad, delivered food, toys and clothing to displaced families, Al Jazeera has reported.

She was also Gaza‚Äôs youngest influencer, offering practical survival tips for daily life under bombardment, such as advice on how to cook with improvised methods when there was no gas. In one social media post, Yaqeen wrote: ‚ÄúI try to bring a bit of joy to the other children so that they can forget the war.‚Äù

1:19 Dozens killed after Israeli attack on school used as shelter in Gaza ‚Äì video report

How has Israel intensified its attacks on Gaza in recent days? Israeli airstrikes killed at least 52 people on Monday, including 31 in a school turned shelter that was struck as people slept, igniting their belongings, according to local health officials.

What is the latest with Israel‚Äôs aid blockade ? A US-backed group tasked with delivering supplies said it had begun operations on Monday, in a plan endorsed by Israel but rejected by the UN.

How are Israel‚Äôs allies responding? The UK, France and Canada have called for Israel to end the siege of Gaza, with the British foreign secretary calling Israeli actions ‚Äúmonstrous‚Äù. But, as Patrick Wintour explains in Today in Focus, allies have not yet used all the tools at their disposal.

Trump peppers Memorial Day speech with partisan attacks

Donald Trump honored the sacrifices of military veterans in the traditional presidential Memorial Day speech at Arlington national cemetery, but also peppered his address on Monday with partisan political asides while talking up his own plans.

The US president laid a wreath, paid tribute to fallen soldiers and gave accounts of battlefield courage. But he also veered off into rally-style personal boasting and anti-immigration rhetoric. His words followed a Truth Social tirade on Monday in which he called judges stalling his deportation aims ‚Äì chiefly because of his ignoring due process ‚Äì ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù and used sweeping disparagements of undocumented immigrants.

Who else is Trump attacking? Meanwhile, the US president also said on Monday he was considering taking a further $3bn of grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools.

Moscow launched a third consecutive night of extensive drone strikes against Ukraine, killing at least six people, as Trump suggested the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, had ‚Äúgone crazy‚Äù.

Overnight on Monday, Russia fired a record 355 Shahed drones as well as nine cruise missiles, in an escalating aerial campaign targeting Ukraine‚Äôs cities and communities.

The Kremlin sought to downplay Trump‚Äôs remarks, attributing them to ‚Äúemotional overload‚Äù.

Here‚Äôs what Trump said on Truth Social: ‚ÄúSomething has happened to [Putin]. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that‚Äôs proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!‚Äù

Has Trump indeed always said that Putin wants all of Ukraine? No. The idea that Trump has long been troubled by Putin‚Äôs imperial ambitions is an absolutely warped version of the real history, writes Archie Bland.

Israel military says intercepted two projectiles fired from Yemen,"A family digs through trash for bits of food, showing Gaza‚Äôs growing desperation

DEIR AL BALAH: With flies buzzing all around them, the woman and her daughter picked through the pile of garbage bags for scraps of food at the foot of a destroyed building in Gaza City. She found a small pile of cooked rice, a few scraps of bread, a box with some smears of white cheese still inside.

Islam Abu Taeima picked soggy bits from a piece of bread and put the dry part in her sack. She will take what she found back to the school where she and hundreds of other families live, boil it and serve it to her five children, she said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dying of hunger,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt eat, we‚Äôll die.‚Äù

Her rummaging for food is a new sign of the depths of desperation being reached in Gaza, where the population of some 2.3 million has been pushed toward famine by Israel‚Äôs nearly three-month blockade. The entry of a small amount of aid in the past week has done almost nothing to ease the situation.

Before the war, it was rare to see anyone searching through garbage for anything, despite the widespread poverty in the Gaza Strip.

Since Israel launched its military campaign decimating the strip after Hamas‚Äô Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, it has been common to see children searching through growing, stinking piles of uncollected garbage for wood or plastic to burn in their family‚Äôs cooking fire or for anything worth selling ‚Äî but not for food. For food, they might search through the rubble of damaged buildings, hoping for abandoned canned goods.

But Abu Taeima says she has no options left. She and her 9-year-old daughter Waed wander around Gaza City, looking for leftovers discarded in the trash.

‚ÄúThis is our life day to day,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt gather anything, then we don‚Äôt eat.‚Äù

It‚Äôs still not common, but now people picking food from trash are occasionally seen. Some come out after dark because of the shame.

‚ÄúI feel sorry for myself because I‚Äôm educated and despite that I‚Äôm eating from the trash,‚Äù said Abu Taeima, who has a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English from Al-Quds Open University in Gaza.

Her family struggled to get by even before the war, she said. Abu Taeima has worked for a short time in the past as a secretary for UNRWA, the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees and the biggest employer in Gaza. She also worked as a reader for blind people. Her husband worked briefly as a security guard for UNRWA. He was wounded in the 2021 war between Hamas and Israel and has been unable to work since.

Israel cut off all food, medicine and other supplies to Gaza on March 2. It said the blockade and its subsequent resumption of the war aimed to pressure Hamas to release the hostages it still holds. But warnings of famine have stoked international criticism of Israel.

It allowed several hundred trucks into Gaza last week. But much of it hasn‚Äôt reached the population, either aid trucks were looted or because of Israeli military restrictions on aid workers‚Äô movements, especially in northern Gaza, according to the UN Aid groups say the amount of supplies allowed in is nowhere near enough to meet mounting needs.

Abu Taeima and her family fled their home in the Shati refugee camp on the northern side of Gaza City in November 2023. At the time she and one of her children were wounded in a tank shelling, she said.

They first headed to the strip‚Äôs southernmost city of Rafah where they sheltered in a tent for five months. They then moved to the central town of Deir Al-Balah a year ago when Israel first invaded Rafah.

During a two-month ceasefire that began in January, they went back to Shati, but their landlord refused to let them back into their apartment because they couldn‚Äôt pay rent, she said.

Several schools-turned-shelters in Gaza City at first refused to receive them because they were designated for people who fled towns in northern Gaza. Only when she threatened to set herself and her family on fire did one school give them a space, she said.

Abu Taeima said her family can‚Äôt afford anything in the market, where prices have skyrocketed for the little food that remains on sale. She said she has tried going to charity kitchens, but every time they run out of food before she gets any. Such kitchens, producing free meals, have become the last source of food for many in Gaza, and giant crowds flood them every day, pushing and shoving to get a meal.

‚ÄúPeople are struggling, and no one is going to be generous with you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo collecting from the trash is better.‚Äù

The risk of catching disease isn‚Äôt at the top of her list of worries.

‚ÄúStarvation is the biggest disease,‚Äù she said.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2602301/middle-east,World
Palestinians clean up after Israeli nationalist march in Jerusalem,"An Israeli flag is removed from above a Palestinian-owned shop in the wake of Jerusalem Day

Some had to use crowbars, hammers and wirecutters to regain access to their own shops after many were vandalised during the Jerusalem Day march the day before.

Jerusalem Day commemorates Israeli forces taking east Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

On Tuesday, metal shutters protecting the shopfronts bore the marks of the parade's passing, with padlocks blocked and stickers slapped upon them.

""No humanitarian aid for Gaza,"" read one sticker from Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power).

The far-right party headed by firebrand politician and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir had a major presence in Monday's march.

Ben Gvir visited the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, during the Jerusalem Day events.

Israel considers all of Jerusalem, including the annexed Palestinian-majority east, its indivisible capital.

The international community does not recognise this, and Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.

On Tuesday, when employees of an east Jerusalem electricity supplier arrived at their office they discovered the front windows broken and the door blocked.

'Childish acts'

A company official, Ismail Eshqart, came from headquarters to change the lock and assess the damage.

He told AFP they had expected ""a little more tension"" than usual this year in the alley in the Muslim Quarter where Palestinians and a few Israeli residents, mostly religious Jews, mingle daily.

He said there had been ""deliberate acts of vandalism"", but he did not name the suspected perpetrators.

""They come and attack shops, make them close, and they break things, they throw firecrackers,"" he told AFP as a municipal employee arrived with an electric saw to cut the padlock on the door of his sabotaged shop.

""They do what they want and nobody says to them 'what are you doing? That's not allowed'!"" Abu Osama added, angry at lost time over ""childish acts"" that made him open several hours late.

Fruit sellers at stalls in front of the Damascus Gate into the Old City shared his dismay, but shrugged as they unloaded boxes of cherries and peaches.

""The situation is worse and worse,"" said grandmother Umm Mohammed who was born in the Old City and had come to do her shopping.

'It's crazy!'

""We want to live in peace -- we are kind people,"" she said, adding that she did not leave the house on Monday.

Umm Mohammed said that last year, one man she knows ""came out of his house and they hit him -- and he is a big guy!""

Armed with solvent and sponges, a group of around 10 Israeli and foreign volunteers arrived on Tuesday morning to help clean up in the march's aftermath.

""I came to do what I could, even if it's not much,"" said one volunteer who asked not to be identified.

They scuttled between the shops, trying to avoid police patrols, but several were briefly stopped for allegedly disturbing the peace.

Contacted by AFP, police did not respond to a request for comment.

""It's really upside down. It's crazy,"" said 24-year-old Joshua Korn of the Israeli-Palestinian activist group Standing Together.

""It's crazy because these people who are here to protect us... they shout at us that we're provoking... just because we're here to remove racist graffiti and stickers that have been put up by settlers in an act of provocation!"" Korn said of the police.

Greek coastguards charged over 2023 migrant shipwreck,"Greek coastguards charged over 2023 migrant shipwreck

Greek Coast Guard The migrant boat sank with 650 people onboard

A naval court in Greece has charged 17 coastguards over the deadliest migrant boat disaster in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade. Up to 650 people were feared to have drowned when the overcrowded Adriana fishing vessel sank near Pylos, off the Greek coast, in the early hours of 14 June 2023. Survivors later told the BBC that Greek coastguards had caused their boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then silenced witnesses. ""It has taken us two years just for these charges to come, even though so many people witnessed what happened,"" one of the survivors said on Monday. The Greek authorities have always denied the claims against them.

Captain of coastguard ship charged

The Deputy Prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court has found that 17 members of the Hellenic Coast Guard should face criminal charges. Among them is the captain of the coastguard ship, the LS-920, who is charged with ""causing a shipwreck"", leading to the deaths of ""at least 82 people"". This corresponds to the number of bodies recovered, although it is thought as many as an additional 500 people drowned, including women and children who were all below deck. The disaster occurred in international waters but within Greece's rescue zone. The then-Chief of the Coast Guard and the Supervisor of the National Search and Rescue Coordination Centre in Piraeus are among four officials charged with ""exposing others to danger"". The captain of the LS-920 is also charged with ""dangerous interference of maritime transport"" as well as a ""failure to provide assistance"" to the migrant boat. The crew of the ship are charged for ""simple complicity"" in all the acts allegedly committed by the captain.

Doubts over Greek officials' account

A coastguard ship had been monitoring the Adriana for 15 hours before it sank. It had left Libya for Italy with an estimated 750 people on board. Only 104 of them are known to have survived. We have been investigating since the day of the disaster and our series of findings has cast serious doubt on the official Greek version of events. Within a week, we obtained shipping data which challenged the claim the migrant boat had not been in trouble and so did not need to be rescued. A month later, survivors told us the coastguard had caused their boat to sink in a disastrous effort to tow it and then forced witnesses to stay silent. Last year, a case against nine Egyptians was thrown out, amid claims they had been scapegoated by the Greek authorities. Earlier this year, audio recordings emerged which further challenged the official Greek version of events.

Syrian survivors feel 'vindicated'

We first met Syrian refugees, who we called Ahmad and Musaab to protect their identities, a month after the disaster. They said they each paid $4,500 (¬£3,480) for a spot on the boat. The younger brother of Ahmad - a Syrian now living in Germany - was also on board and did not survive. Musaab described to us the moment when - he alleged - the Greek coastguards caused their boat to sink. ""They attached a rope from the left,"" he said. ""Everyone moved to the right side of our boat to balance it. The Greek vessel moved off quickly causing our boat to flip. They kept dragging it for quite a distance."" The men claimed that once on land, in the port of Kalamata, the coastguard told survivors to ""shut up"" when they started to talk about how the Greek authorities had caused the disaster. ""When people replied by saying the Greek coastguard was the cause, the official in charge of the questioning asked the interpreter to tell the interviewee to stop talking,"" Ahmad said. He said officials shouted: ""You have survived death. Stop talking about the incident Don't ask more questions about it."" On Monday, Ahmad said he felt vindicated by the charges that had been brought. ""I'm very happy they are eventually being held accountable for all that they have committed, but until I see them in prison nothing has been done yet,"" he said. ""To be honest, the Greek legal system is very unreliable.""

Conscience is dead,"GERMAN satirist Kurt Tucholsky wrote, ‚ÄúThe death of one man: this is a catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of deaths: that is a statistic!‚Äù As abhorrent as the thought may be, the world we live in today is a living embodiment of this observation. The ruins of Gaza with thousands of unmarked graves and hundreds of wailing mothers are proof that the collective conscience of the world has taken a back seat, allowing murderers to reign supreme.

Not a day passes without the news cycle adding yet another statistic of death and destruction to the already extensively chronicled genocide of the people of Gaza, their bereavement eventually becoming nothing more than a footnote in history. For years, the world looked remorsefully at the plight of the Jews and their near extermination at the hands of Nazi Germany. The Holocaust was chronicled and remembered not just because it was a tragedy but because it was a tragedy which the world had vowed to learn from.

Such were the horrors of the Holocaust that Jewish Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin coined the word ‚Äògenocide‚Äô to give it a name. To him, this word loosely translated to the killing of a tribe/ race, which adequately described the conscious effort by a powerful force to erase a group of people from the face of the earth.

Yet in little over eight decades since, the world is witnessing another genocide ‚Äî one which is being broadcast live. A ge¬≠¬≠nocide where the murderers can be clearly seen. A genocide where children are being made to starve. A genocide where the earth smells of blood and bones. A genocide where madness reigns supreme.

The thirst for Palestinian blood remains unquenched.

Unfortunately, much like the Holocaust, the world watches from the comfort of their homes, as Gazan homes are turned into graves, relegating their respective conscience to mere lip service. What is happening in Gaza and the rest of Pales¬≠tine is not just a genocide, it is a conscious effort by the State of Israel to demons-trate the collective impotence of the rest of the world.

Over 50,000 people have been killed in Gaza, thousands of families wiped out as if they never existed. Yet the thirst for blood remains unquenched. There have been an¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠nouncements that the oppressors wish to take over the whole of Gaza and that such takeover has already been set in motion. Stop for a moment and think: has there ever been an event in the world where genocide, mass murder and illegal confiscation were being announced from the global stage and nobody batted an eyelid?

The Holocaust is said to be the first genocide that the world had witnessed. Some claim that the killings of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in Rwanda was the second widely accepted genocide. Unfortunately, it appears that we are witnessing the third widely accepted genocide. And what is markedly different this time is that unlike the civil war-like situation in Rwanda and the Nazi denials of extermination camps, the death of Gazans can be witnessed by all, but the world has chosen to look the other way.

In fact, the very same people whose brethren are being killed in Gaza are busy preparing red carpet receptions for the US president whose administration continues to aid and abet this genocide. It is ironic that it took Israel allegedly firing at a diplomatic mission in the West Bank for some of the nations of the world to take note and ask the Israeli authorities for an explanation.

If you go to the UN‚Äôs website, you will find hundreds of charters made to safeguard the rights of the people. Among them is the United Nations Genocide Convention of 1948, which came into effect in 1951. This charter defi¬≠nes the word ‚Äògenocide‚Äô as any ac¬≠¬≠ti¬≠¬≠on committed with the intention of dest¬≠r¬≠oy¬≠ing ‚Äúa national, ethnical, racial or religious group‚Äù. The definitions include, inter alia, killing, ‚Äúca¬≠¬≠using serious mental or bodily harm

‚Ä¶ imposing measures intended to

prevent births‚Äù, and taking calculated measures to adversely affect people‚Äôs conditions of life and bring about their physical destruction.

Unfortunately, despite the presence of such a convention and the declaration that people engaged in such genocide would be punished, the perpetrators of the Gazan genocide appear to be using the convention as a ‚Äòto do‚Äô list. They appear to be making sure that they religiously undertake each and every act which forms part of the definition of genocide, almost mocking the international community and its laws. At this point, the only usefulness of these international charters for the people of Gaza would be as fodder to keep their stoves heated.

The world has failed Gaza and it now waits for their wails to die down and for their bones to disappear so that a ‚Äòriviera of the Middle East‚Äô can be built over their graves.

WHO says trucks with medical aid must be allowed into Gaza,"GENEVA: A top World Health Organization official deplored Monday that none of the agency‚Äôs trucks with medical aid had been allowed to enter the Gaza Strip since Israel ended its blockade.

Humanitarian aid has begun trickling back into the Palestinian territory in recent days after more than two months of blocked access.

For more than 11 weeks, ‚Äúthere has been no WHO trucks entering into Gaza for medical care support‚Äù, the WHO‚Äôs Eastern Mediterranean regional director Hanan Balkhy told a press conference in Geneva.

‚ÄúThe situation is devastating. We are not only worried about the immediate work that we are supporting, and are willing and hoping to continue to support the people, but we are extremely concerned about the aftermath of this,‚Äù she said, citing an impact on generations to come.

Israel has stepped up a renewed offensive to destroy the Hamas group, drawing international condemnation of the blockade since early March that has sparked severe food and medical shortages.

Sweden PM says to summon Israel envoy over Gaza aid access

‚ÄúAround 400 trucks were cleared to go into Gaza‚Ä¶ but supplies from only 115 trucks have been able to go through ‚Äì and nothing has reached the besieged north,‚Äù said Balkhy, adding that none of those were WHO trucks.

She said 51 trucks with medical equipment on board were waiting to cross the border.

Ahmed Zouiten, the WHO region‚Äôs emergencies director, said he hoped it was just a question of time before the UN health agency‚Äôs trucks could cross into the territory.

But he said it was ‚Äútoo early for us to know‚Äù whether they would cross soon or whether there were ‚Äúany issues that we have to follow up on‚Äù.

Israel‚Äôs renewed offensive has triggered international criticism, with European and Arab leaders meeting in Spain calling for an end to the ‚Äúinhumane‚Äù and ‚Äúsenseless‚Äù war, while humanitarian groups say the trickle of aid is not nearly enough.

Hamas‚Äôs October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.

Hamas also took 251 hostages, 57 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 who the Israeli military says are dead.

On Monday, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said at least 3,822 people had been killed in the territory since a ceasefire collapsed on March 18, taking the war‚Äôs overall toll to 53,977, mostly civilians.",https://www.brecorder.com/news/40364780,World
The West seems to be at it once again,"THE French president has repeatedly said that by June there would be a Palestinian state. The British and the French seem to be yet again carving out the Middle East secretly behind closed doors just as they did on May 16, 1916, when Britain collaborated with France and secretly divided Arab land, now known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement.

This was done while the British kept up their support for Arab independence in what was known as the McMahon-Hussein correspondence between British High Commissioner in Egypt Henry McMahon and Sharif Hussein bin Ali, the king of Hejaz, regarding a national Arab homeland after the revolt against the Muslim Ottomans in exchange of support for the British.

The revolt was a grave mistake. Nothing came by except the British kept their interest and forever enslaved the Arabs and stole native resources. Soon after the humiliation, the Arabs lost their lands as the British slapped the Balfour Declaration in which the British promised Arab land, which did not belong to them, to another European group; the Zionists.

The Arabs must never trust the British or the French. The Arabs are again being taken for a ride. This is not liberation as the French, the British and the rest of the world, which constantly chants the ‚Äòtwo-state solution‚Äô, would have you believe.

The problem is the occupation of the Arab land, and every inch of it has to be liberated by the Arabs themselves. The Zionist colonisers comprising the British, the French, the Italians, the Polish, and the Ukrainians, all must be thrown out of Palestine.

The two-state solution is yet another form of colonialism. The Europeans will not give the Palestinians anything at all in which the Zionists do not have an even bigger part. The Sykes-Picot Agreement failed, and now a new pact is apparently being prepared by the British, the French and the Americans.

The Arabs have a glorious military history. Even today, the Palestinians can liberate their land for which they need Arab help. The West hates unity among the Arabs, and that is why it is working for the two-state solution.

The British have supplied intelligence and weapons to the Zionists against the Palestinians. They have bombed Yemen and Syria. The British are not to be trusted. And the same is the case with the entire West. The Arabs would do well to reject being part of another agreement of the Sykes-Picot variety.

"Uncertainties over Trump, Ukraine loom large ahead of Asian defence meeting","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media, on the day of a closed House Republican Conference meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 20, 2025. REUTERS/Ken Cedeno/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab

SINGAPORE, May 26 (Reuters) - Uncertainties over the Trump administration's security policies in Asia and Europe, the protracted war in Ukraine as well as fresh India-Pakistan tensions are likely to dominate Asia's leading defence meeting in Singapore later this week.

The Shangri-La Dialogue runs from May 31-June 1, attracting defence ministers, senior military and security officials, diplomats, analysts and weapons makers from around the world.

Sign up here.

Analysts and regional diplomats say while a speech by French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday night is the keynote address, all eyes will also be on U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday when the Pentagon chief lays out his vision for the Trump administration's defence policy for the region.

Hegseth will be closely watched by Asian allies not only for his approach towards them, but also how the Trump administration views and articulates the threat from China's military modernisation and ongoing tensions in disputed waters across East Asia.

Analysts expect conversations around the competition between the U.S. and China, maritime conflicts such as the South China Sea, and defence partnerships to also feature prominently.

""Delegates will be eager to hear Defence Secretary Hegseth reiterate America's commitment to regional security,"" said Ian Storey, a regional security expert at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

""But unlike in Europe, there's no sense of foreboding that the U.S. will draw down its forces in the Indo-Pacific.""

China's defence ministry has yet to announce whether Defence Minister Dong Jun will attend the dialogue and which other officials it might also send.

The ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

This year's Shangri-La Dialogue, which is organised annually by the London-headquartered International Institute for Strategic Studies, will also include a special session by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has sought to balance the country's economic interests with its relationships with both China and the U.S.

INFORMAL MEETING

Analysts and diplomats say that as a freewheeling event, the dialogue often features debates rarely seen in public elsewhere while also providing the opportunity for more discreet bilateral and multilateral talks.

But that informality means it is unlikely to involve any breakthroughs to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine or resolve disputes between India and Pakistan, for example.

India and Pakistan are likely to be represented by senior military officials at the meeting, and not government ministers, diplomats have said, signalling that no breakthroughs are expected.

Collin Koh, a security scholar at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, noted that it may be more difficult to get consensus on difficult issues such as the South China Sea, which involves multiple Southeast Asian countries and China, as different countries prioritise their own interests.

He said that the recent imposition of tariffs on U.S. imports could push these countries to negotiate bilaterally rather than multilaterally, resulting in a more disunited approach and playing into China's hands.

Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at National University of Singapore, said that it will also be important to observe how the U.S. responds to Chinese maritime actions that appear to have ""pushed the envelope"" in recent months.

These include the building of structures in the Yellow Sea, known in South Korea as the West Sea, as well as the holding of live-fire exercises on short notice in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand in February.

""If you have an overly strong response (from the U.S.), it could potentially be escalatory,"" Chong said, adding that the current U.S. administration's unpredictability also makes it difficult to see if it will follow through with any statements it makes.

On the other hand, Koh said that the U.S. is still committed to exercises that have been taking place over the past decade in the Indo-Pacific.

""I don't see that much trepidation in Southeast Asia pertaining to the U.S. security commitment, even with the ongoing domestic issues taking place,"" he said.

Iran rejects temporary halt on uranium enrichment,"Iran will not consider temporarily suspending uranium enrichment to secure a nuclear deal with the US, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday, adding that no date had yet been set for a sixth round of talks with Washington.

The negotiations between Washington and Tehran aim to resolve a decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions, and both sides have taken a tough stance in public over the issue of Iran's uranium enrichment.

Asked about reports that Iran could freeze enrichment for three years to reach an agreement, spokesperson Esmail Baghaei told a press conference: ""Iran will never accept that.""

Baghaei also ruled out the possibility of an interim nuclear deal with the US, dismissing media reports that a provisional agreement was being considered as a temporary step towards a final deal.

President Donald Trump said on Sunday that US negotiators had ""very good"" talks with an Iranian delegation over the weekend. Iran is waiting for further details from mediator Oman regarding the timing of the next round of talks, Baghaei said.

""If there is goodwill from the American side, we are also optimistic, but if talks are aimed at curbing Iran's rights then talks will get nowhere,"" he added.",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2548024/iran-rejects-temporary-halt-on-uranium-enrichment,World
Pakistan to keep modernising its military: US report,"Pakistan regards India as an existential threat and will continue to pursue its military modernization effort, including the development of battlefield nuclear weapons, to offset India's conventional military advantage, said 2025 Worldwide Threat Assessment.

The assessment was prepared by the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and presented to the US House of Representatives' Armed Services Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations based on information available as of May 11, 2025.

Following the April 22 militant attack in occupied Kashmir, India conducted missile strikes in Pakistan. The missile strikes provoked multiple rounds of missile, drone, and loitering munition attacks, and heavy artillery fire, by both militaries from May 7 to May 10, when both countries agreed to a full ceasefire.

The assessment said Pakistan is modernizing its nuclear arsenal and maintaining the security of its nuclear materials and nuclear command and control. ""Pakistan almost certainly procures WMD [Weapons of Mass Destruction] applicable goods from foreign suppliers and intermediaries,"" it claimed.

According to the assessment, Pakistan primarily is a recipient of China's economic and military largesse, and Pakistani forces conduct multiple combined military exercises every year with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), including a new air exercise completed in November 2024.

""Foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan's WMD programs are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transshipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.""

It stated that during the next year, the Pakistani military's top priorities are likely to remain cross-border skirmishes with regional neighbors, rising attacks by the TTP and Baloch militants, counterterrorism efforts, and nuclear modernization. It said despite Pakistan's daily operations during the past year, militants killed more than 2,500 people in Pakistan in 2024.

It also claimed that terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers who support China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects have also emerged as a point of friction between the two countries as seven Chinese nationals were killed in Pakistan in 2024.

According to the assessment, Pakistan and Iran have taken steps, including high-level meetings, to de-escalate tensions after the two countries conducted unilateral airstrikes on each other's territory in January 2024 in response to cross-border terror attacks.

""In September 2024, Taliban and Pakistani border forces clashed near border posts, resulting in the death of eight Taliban fighters. In March 2025, Pakistan and Afghanistan exchanged air and artillery strikes on each other's territory, each citing alleged militant infrastructure as the targets,"" it said.

It stated that South Asia's security situation is shaped by various factors, including terrorism and longstanding mistrust among neighboring states, several of which are modernizing their militaries and nuclear capabilities.

""Terrorist activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan will challenge military and security forces, and ongoing tensions along India and China's Line of Actual Control border demarcation are capable of escalating quickly. Russia and China continue efforts to bring regional powers closer into their respective spheres of influence,"" it added.

The assessment said Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi's defense priorities will probably focus on demonstrating global leadership, countering China, and enhancing New Delhi's military power.

""India views China as its primary adversary and Pakistan more an ancillary security problem to be managed, despite cross-border attacks in mid-May by both India's and Pakistan's militaries.""

It said to counter Chinese influence and boost its global leadership role, India is giving priority to advancing its bilateral defense partnerships in the Indian Ocean region through exercises, training, arms sales, and information sharing.

India also has increased trilateral engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and actively participates in multilateral fora such as the Quadrilateral, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and ASEAN.

It said that China will continue to advance selected areas of partnership with Russia while avoiding actions such as overtly providing materiel or lethal military assistance to Russia that might elicit reputational or economic costs for Beijing.",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2547816/pakistan-to-keep-modernising-its-military-us-report,World

North Korea says US 'Golden Dome' risks 'outer space nuclear war',"North Korea says US 'Golden Dome' risks 'space nuclear war'

Pyongyang derided Donald Trump's recently announced defence system, which will be aimed at countering ""next-generation"" aerial threats including ballistic and cruise missiles.

It accused Washington of being ""hell-bent... to militarise outer space"" and warned that the plan might spark ""a global nuclear and space arms race"".

Pyongyang's foreign ministry slammed the plan as ""the height of self-righteousness [and] arrogance"", state media reported.

The defence system, which President Donald Trump plans to unveil by the end of his term, is aimed at countering ""next-generation"" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.

North Korea has criticised the US's plan for a futuristic ""Golden Dome"" missile shield , saying it could ""turn outer space into a potential nuclear war field"".

North Korea considers Washington an adversary and has routinely condemned joint military drills between the US and South Korea.

Pyongyang probably sees the Golden Dome as a threat that can ""significantly weaken"" its nuclear arsenal, Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP news agency.

""If the US completes its new missile defence programme, the North will be forced to develop alternative means to counter or penetrate it,"" he said.

In 2022, the North passed a law declaring itself a nuclear weapons state, and it has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years.

Early this year it claimed it fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead which it said ""will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region"".

North Korea joins China in criticising the US's plan. Beijing said last week that it is ""seriously concerned"" about the Golden Dome, which it said has ""strong offensive implications"".

""The United States, in pursuing a 'US-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,"" China's foreign ministry said. ""This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability.""

Many analysts believe an update to the US's limited defence systems is necessary, but some warn the process of developing the Golden Dome could face technical and political challenges.

For one, its hefty price tag could suck up a large chunk of the US defence budget.

An initial sum of $25bn (¬£18.7bn) has been earmarked in a new budget bill - although the government has estimated it could end up costing 20 times that over decades.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0l4e0rnr1o,World
"Israeli military wants to occupy 75% of Gaza within two months, local media report","ADVERTISEMENT

Israel's military have revealed that they plan to control 75% of Gaza within two months, local media reported.

It comes as Israel continues to ramp up its offensive in Gaza, in what it says is a bid to pressure Hamas to release the remaining Israeli hostages.

As part of its expanding military operation, Israel said it will launch a new aid delivery mechanism on Monday, would push the Palestinian population into three small zones in Gaza, and would then occupy the remaining three quarters of Gaza.

The Israel Defence Forces revealed its renewed offensive in the Strip is no longer about fighting Hamas', but instead about capturing territory, controlling food distribution and destroying Hamas infrastructure, local media reported on Sunday.

Hamas previously said it would release the hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli military withdrawal from the territory.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, rejected the terms and said that Israel plans on ""taking control of all of Gaza,"" and wants to establish a new system to distribute aid that circumvents the militant group.

Israel blocked all food, medicine and fuel from entering Gaza for almost three months, which prompted global criticism and widespread concerns about the critical risk of famine.

Israel is also pursuing a new US-backed plan to control aid to Gaza, but the American leading the effort unexpectedly resigned on Sunday, citing it had become clear that his organisation would not be allowed to operate independently.

The UN previously said it would not be involved in the US-backed plan because it is not impartial, neutral or independent.

There is mounting evidence of genocide, which is either being perpetrated or at a minimum at serious risk of occurring, the letter states, highlighting recent comments by the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who said Israel‚Äôs army would ‚Äúwipe out‚Äù what remains of Palestinian Gaza.

The signatories tell Starmer: ‚ÄúAll states, including the UK, are legally obliged to take all reasonable steps within their power to prevent and punish genocide; to ensure respect for international humanitarian law; and to bring to an end violations of [the right to self-determination]. The UK‚Äôs actions to date have failed to meet those standards ‚Ä¶ The international community‚Äôs failure to uphold international law in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory contributes to a deteriorating international climate of lawlessness and impunity and imperils the international legal system itself. Your government must act now, before it is too late.‚Äù

The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, last week announced the suspension of negotiations over a new free trade deal with Israel, but the two-page letter, backed by a 35-page legal memorandum, says he must go further, faster by reviewing existing trade ties, suspending the 2030 roadmap for closer UK-Israel partnership and imposing trade sanctions.

The legal experts call on him to immediately sanction Israeli ministers or senior officials in the Israel Defense Forces who they accuse of having incited genocide or supporting and sponsoring illegal settlements. They note that so far financial sanctions and travel bans have been limited to individual settlers, settler outposts and settler organisations.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has previously said: ‚ÄúThe charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it‚Äôs outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.‚Äù

The letter, also signed by the former court of appeal judges Sir Stephen Sedley, Sir Anthony Hooper and Sir Alan Moses, a former chair of the bar of England and Wales (Matthias Kelly KC) and of the bar of Northern Ireland (Brian Fee KC), says Israel has been responsible for ‚Äúan unparalleled assault on the United Nations‚Äù.

It points to Israel‚Äôs banning of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which it calls the ‚Äúbackbone of aid‚Äù for the Palestinian people, from operating in the occupied territory and ‚Äúattacks on UN premises, property and personnel‚Äù. These acts are said to ‚Äúgo beyond isolated breaches. They amount to a broader challenge to the UN charter system itself.‚Äù

Accordingly, as a permanent member on the UN security council, the signatories say the UK should consider initiating proceedings that provide for suspension of a member state.

Moses said: ‚ÄúWe, in the UK, cannot expect peace unless we fulfil our obligations under international law. That is what upholding the rule of law means. It is an exercise in futility for a government to say it upholds the rule of law, if it then does nothing to demonstrate it.‚Äù

Prof Guy Goodwin-Gill, a signatory and emeritus fellow of All Souls College, University of Oxford, said: ‚ÄúNow is the time for the UK to show its commitment to the rule of law and to a future in which Palestinians can freely fulfil their right to self-determination. Everyone must be free from persecution, from displacement and ethnic cleansing, from the devastation and death deliberately inflicted on them in their homes, schools and hospitals, in their farms and villages. No one should ever be a refugee in their own land.‚Äù

Lammy‚Äôs strongest intervention on Israel to date came amid anger at Israel‚Äôs refusal to allow thousands of aid trucks access to starving Palestinians. While an 11-week blockade has officially been lifted, the letter says that the limited aid allowed in ‚Äúremains gravely insufficient to address the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe‚Äù.

More than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli offensive in Gaza since 7 October 2023 when a Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 1,200 people. An Israeli strike early on Monday on a school turned shelter, while people inside were sleeping, killed 36, according to health officials.

Also on Monday, one of Israel‚Äôs staunchest allies, Germany, added to international condemnation, with the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, saying the harm inflicted on civilians ‚Äúcan no longer be justified as a fight against Hamas terrorism‚Äù.

In order to meet its legal obligations, the UK is also urged in the letter to secure an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the resumption of aid and the lifting of Israel‚Äôs ban on Unrwa. Finally, it says the UK should confirm that it would execute the international criminal court‚Äôs arrest warrants against the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant.

The letter increases the pressure on Starmer to act in the same week that the attorney general, Lord Hermer KC, is due to deliver the Rusi thinktank‚Äôs annual security lecture on ‚Äúthe condition of the international-rules-based-order‚Äù.

Many Labour and Tory backbenchers have already said that the suspension of talks on the free trade deal does not go nearly far enough.

India races to contain oil spill after container ship sinks off Kerala coast,"India‚Äôs coastguard raced on Monday to contain an oil spill from a container ship with hazardous cargo that sank off the southern coast a day earlier, Kerala‚Äôs state government said.

The Liberian-flagged MSC ELSA 3, listed as a 184 meter freight ship, went down off the coast of Kerala on Sunday, with all 24 crew members rescued.

It was carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo and 12 containing calcium carbide, a chemical used for fertiliser production and steelmaking. The vessel also contained some 370 tonnes of fuel and oil.

‚ÄúThe Coast Guard is taking action to prevent the spread of oil using two ships,‚Äù Kerala‚Äôs government said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe work of spraying dust to destroy the oil is in progress using a Dornier aircraft‚Äù.

India‚Äôs defence ministry said the ship sank ‚Äúdue to flooding‚Äù some 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi, raising concerns for the ‚Äúsensitive marine ecosystem along Kerala‚Äôs coast‚Äù.

The government has put coastal areas on high alert and warned people not to touch or approach any containers ‚Äî some of which have already washed up along the coast.

"110,000 refugees in Pakistan have high-risk profiles: UNHCR","ISLAMABAD: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office has said some 110,000 refugees and asylum-seekers in Pakistan, including a minimum of 8 per cent of Proof of Registration (PoR) cardholders, have both high-risk profiles with increased international protection needs, and specific or cumulative vulnerabilities that could qualify them for resettlement.

The Resettlement Programme in Pakistan has been active since the 1980s and more than 20,000 vulnerable refugees have now departed for resettlement to third countries to find safety and rebuild their lives, UNHCR says in its latest resettlement factsheet on Pakistan Operation.

In 2021, following the changed situation in Afghanistan, there was a renewed interest by the international community in the resettlement of Afghan refugees, leading to an increase in resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

The US topped the list of nine countries that accepted Afghan refugees for resettlement. The US accepted 10,823 Afghan refugees, followed by Australia (4,362), Canada (2,253), the United Kingdom (954), New Zealand (817), Norway (248), Sweden (182), Finland (116), and Italy (72).

Over 300,000 Afghans returned, deported by Pakistan, Iran in a month, says IFRC

Since 2021, several diplomatic missions in Pakistan established their own ‚ÄúSafe Passage‚Äù programmes to facilitate the evacuation and relocation of Afghan nationals affiliated with their foreign missions in Afgha¬≠nistan, they are outside the framework of UNHCR‚Äôs Resettle¬≠ment Programme, the agency clarified.

‚ÄúResettlement is unique in that it is the only durable solution that involves the relocation of refugees from an asylum country to a third country,‚Äù the UNHCR said. Those prioritised include survivors of violence, vulnerable women and girls, at-risk children, and individuals with serious medical conditions.

Worsening crisis

Meanwhile, the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) warned that Afghanistan‚Äôs humanitarian crisis ‚Äî marked by extreme poverty, food insecurity, and a strained health system ‚Äî is worsening due to a mass influx of returnees, largely triggered by Pakistan‚Äôs Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).

‚ÄúThis influx of Afghan nationals has put further strain on an already fragile infrastructure, complicating efforts to provide essential services to those in need,‚Äù the IFRC said.

Last month, the IFRC launched a Federation-wide Emergency Appeal in response to escalating humanitarian needs, seeking 25 million Swiss francs to scale up multi-sectoral immediate and longer-term assistance.

In April, over 144,500 people returned from Pakistan, with more than 29,900 deported. ‚ÄúDuring the month of April, between 4,000 and 6,000 people were arriving in Afgha¬≠nistan each day,‚Äù the IFRC reported.

The influx of returnees, amidst persistent drought, pre-existing internal displacements, and deteriorating economic conditions, is placing immense pressure on already overstretched services.

Adding to the pressure, returns from Iran are also increasing due to policy shifts hindering access to legal protection. Between March 20 and April 30, 170,200 Afghans arrived from Iran. The combined returns from Pakistan and Iran, exceeding 300,000 in April alone, are placing ‚Äúextreme pressure‚Äù on Afghanistan‚Äôs border regions and urban areas ill-equipped for such large movements, the IFRC concluded.

Sources deny recent media reports regarding alcohol in the Kingdom,"Saudi ministers announce full Hajj readiness with 1.07 million pilgrims already in Kingdom

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia reaffirmed its full readiness to serve pilgrims during Hajj 1446H, with more than 1.07 million pilgrims already in the Kingdom and advanced digital systems deployed across sectors to ensure a safe and seamless experience for them.

At a joint press conference on Monday, ministers from Hajj and Umrah, Health, Transport and Media outlined the strategic and operational plans for the pilgrimage season, which align with Vision 2030‚Äôs goals for service excellence.

Minister of Hajj and Umrah Tawfiq Al-Rabiah said that more than 1.4 million Nusuk smart cards had been issued and more than 30 new digital services launched via the Nusuk app this year. The digital platform supports the entire pilgrim journey, from arrival to departure, including permits, mobility, guidance and real-time updates.

Al-Rabiah said that pilgrim camp allocations in Mina and Arafat were now fully integrated with crowd flow systems.

‚ÄúWe began preparing for this season immediately after the last one ended,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFrom digital permits to onsite inspections, our goal is a safe, efficient pilgrimage for all.‚Äù

As part of the operational strategy, the ministry has conducted more than 37,000 inspections of service providers this month, identifying 3,400 violations and resolving them immediately.

To assist pilgrims on the ground, more than 120 guidance points have been established, including the ‚ÄúAsk Me‚Äù service and more than 400 electric carts for the elderly and people with disabilities.

Minister of Health Fahad Al-Jalajel said that more than 50,000 healthcare services had been delivered, with no epidemic cases detected so far.

A 60 percent increase in clinical capacity has been implemented this year, supported by three field hospitals, 71 emergency points, 900 ambulances and 11 air ambulances. Since the start of the season, the ministry has performed 140 surgeries, 65 heart catheterizations and six open-heart operations.

‚ÄúOur focus is prevention first, followed by rapid response,‚Äù Al-Jalajel said. ‚ÄúWe are committed to protecting every pilgrim from harm.‚Äù

Minister of Transport Saleh Al-Jasser announced the integration of smart monitoring systems, including the use of drones to monitor crowd movement and sensor-enabled roads to reduce heat by up to 12 degrees Celsius.

The Mashair Train will carry up to 72,000 pilgrims per hour, while Haramain High-Speed Railway is offering 2 million seats, up by 400,000 from last year. Additionally, rubberized and cooled road technologies have been expanded by 30 percent to improve comfort and reduce heat exposure.

Minister of Media Salman Al-Dosari said that the Kingdom had launched Hajj awareness campaigns in 50 languages and was now hosting international broadcasters from more than 25 countries. More than 10,000 Wi-Fi access points have also been activated in the holy sites to keep pilgrims connected.

Al-Dosari emphasized the role of AI this year in managing crowd flow and optimizing decision making in real time through data analysis, all handled by trained digital teams.

‚ÄúServing pilgrims is a duty we inherit and honor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEvery detail matters and this year, every tool of technology and collaboration is in place to ensure a successful Hajj.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2602196/saudi-arabia,World
"Syrian refugee, 19, praised after pinning down assailant in Hamburg knife attack","A 19-year-old Syrian refugee in Germany has been hailed as a hero after he pinned down an assailant at Hamburg‚Äôs main railway station, helping to halt an attack in which 18 people were injured.

Police on Friday said a 39-year-old German woman had been arrested at the scene of the attack and that she was believed to be in a state of psychological distress. The 18 people injured were later reported to all be in stable condition, while the woman was placed in psychiatric care.

As the city reeled from the incident, the spotlight landed on Muhammad Al Muhammad, who had been heading to his home in Buchholz, 25km from Hamburg, after visiting a friend in the city. He was waiting on the platform for his train when he spotted a woman wielding a knife.

He watched as people began running away from the woman. ‚ÄúI decided to run in the other direction and stop the woman,‚Äù he told the German news magazine Der Spiegel.

As he made his way, he saw another man, whom he described as Chechen, kick the woman in the knee, causing her to fall to the ground. ‚ÄúI held her [down] and pressed her hands against her rucksack so she couldn‚Äôt get up,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe woman didn‚Äôt scream, she didn‚Äôt resist.‚Äù

Police arrived a few moments later. As they pointed their weapons towards them, Muhammad moved away from the woman slowly, his hands raised in the air.

Der Spiegel, which said it had verified Muhammad‚Äôs identity, noted that the actions of the two men had probably prevented more people from being injured.

News of their interventions soon began to make waves across Germany, with some contrasting it to the sustained efforts by the far-right, anti-immigrant party Alternative f√ºr Deutschland, to link migration to crime, even as a recent study by the Munich-based Ifo Institute found there was ‚Äúno correlation‚Äù between migration and higher crime rates.

Many in German media have seemingly also echoed this association; a 2023 analysis found that both print and television media reported five times more on violent crimes when the suspect was a foreigner in Germany, the broadcaster Deutsche Welle noted recently.

Against this backdrop, it was crucial to share the story of Muhammad, who is originally from near Aleppo and arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2022, the journalist and political commentator Gilda Sahebi wrote in Germany‚Äôs Die Tageszeitung newspaper.

‚ÄúOne is tempted to say: ‚ÄòSee? An Arab ‚Äì his name is Muhammad, no less ‚Äì is a hero!‚Äô‚Äù Sahebi wrote. ‚ÄúThe political and public debate is now so dripping with racist toxicity, spread by a far-right party and its influencers in media and social media, but also by democratic political and media actors, that it is necessary to tell the story of Muhammad Al Muhammad.‚Äù

Muhammad said that, following the attack, he had been questioned by police before eventually making his way home. ‚ÄúThe police thanked me and bought me a cappuccino,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat made me very happy.‚Äù",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/hamburg-knife-attack-syrian-refugee,World
