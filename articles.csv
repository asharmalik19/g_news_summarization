Official dimensions prove incorrect: Galaxy Z Fold7 and Oppo Find N5 thicker than specified,"For the launch of the Galaxy Z Fold7 in July, Samsung is advertising the smartphone as the thinnest foldable in the world, just like Oppo did a few weeks ago, but the official figures do not exactly stand up to close scrutiny. This also explains the varying specifications in thickness for the Galaxy Z Fold6 successor.

4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

If you're looking for the official dimensions of a smartphone, the details can usually be found in the corresponding data sheet because that's where you'll find the measurements down to the millimeter, right? Wrong. Manufacturers seem to have established idiosyncratic measurement methodologies, at least for foldables, which, while logically justifiable, seem quite arbitrary.

Well-known French leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer aka @OnLeaks, who recently asked the X community for the exact dimensions of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 (available here at Amazon), got the ball rolling. He didn't want to know what the data sheet says, but rather how thick the Samsung foldable actually is in practice. Based on a CAD module, he measured the soon-to-be-launched successor Galaxy Z Fold7 as 4.5-mm thick back in February, which was undercut by equally reliable leaker Ice Universe's measurement of 3.9 mm.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/Official-dimensions-prove-incorrect-Galaxy-Z-Fold7-and-Oppo-Find-N5-thicker-than-specified.1015910.0.html,Technology
Apple to leverage AI for its upcoming battery-saving feature,"According to sources close to Bloomberg, Apple is working on an AI-powered battery-saving feature for its upcoming iOS 19. The feature will work based on the user's usage habits and optimize things in the background to extend battery life.

The AI will learn from users' behavior on the fly and reduce power consumption by optimizing apps in the background depending on the time of day. Apple is reportedly already training the AI using data collected from people's iPhones, so the system has a general idea of users' usage habits. After a while, the AI will adapt to the specific user's patterns.

Many Android smartphone OEMs have implemented the feature in the past, but it has never leveraged AI and a large data pool. So, it will be interesting to see how it will work on iOS.

Some believe Apple is implementing this feature to maintain adequate battery life on its upcoming iPhone 17 Air, if that's going to be the name, of course. Since the device will be extremely thin, the battery size will probably be pretty small, so Apple thinks it can compensate by introducing software smarts.

We might see our first glimpse of the battery life feature during this year's WWDC in June.

"All-New Nissan Patrol (Armada) Drags Refreshed Lexus LX, One Behemoth Is Just Inches Ahead","Mat Watson and his friends from the carwow team aren't in Great Britain anymore - they're somewhere sunny and dry, but they still like to race as if they're back at home.

More precisely, they're visiting the Al Ain Municipality in the Al Ain Region of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. Over there, they made some friends who were kind enough to give them access to the Tilal Swaihan stadium, arena, and sports venue for some usual quarter-mile drag and half-mile roll race shenanigans, followed by a classic brake test.

The protagonists on this occasion are the recently facelifted Lexus LX – though, unfortunately, they're not testing the new LX 700h but rather the well-known LX 600, which packs the 3.4-liter V35A-FTS twin-turbo V6 and churns out 415 hp and 650 Nm or 479 lb-ft of torque via the ten-speed Direct Shift automatic transmission. Next to it resides the all-new seventh-generation Nissan Patrol (known as Armada in North America) instead of the Infiniti QX80.

However, they share a lot of components, including the new 3.5-liter VR35DDTT twin-turbo V6 with 425 horsepower and a nine-speed automatic transmission. The thing about the two full-size body-on-frame SUV models that differentiates them, aside from the price, is weight – the Lexus LX is slightly lighter than the Nissan Patrol, according to the carwow team. Will that make a difference?

Well, as it turns out, when they start level and don't jump the start, the Lexus LX and Nissan Patrol go head-to-head like clockwork, and it's almost impossible to see which one of them wins a traditional quarter-mile dragstrip encounter because they're only inches apart when crossing the finish line. Alas, in the end, Mat concludes the Nissan Patrol wins two out of three, though both of them clock a best pass of 14.9s across the quarter mile on an unprepped surface.

Next up, they did a roll race over the half-mile distance, but over there it was clear that Lexus reigned supreme thanks to its better transmission setup. Last but not least, they also don't forget about the importance of safety – the final test is the emergency brake stop. This time around, all faults are excused for the newer Nissan Patrol because, although it's heavier, it has a much better stopping distance – we reckon it's at least a couple of SUVs between them.

By the way, if you want either in the United States instead of UAE, the all-new Nissan Armada sibling of the Patrol kicks off at $57,250 and you can choose SV, SL, Platinum, rugged Pro-4X, as well as a stylish Platinum Reserve trim level if you're willing to go up to $77k. Meanwhile, the Lexus LX starts from no less than $106,850 with Premium, Luxury, and F Sport Handling grades for the LX 600. The new LX 700h kicks off at $115k with the Overtrail and goes all the way up to more than $141k in Ultra Luxury form.",https://www.autoevolution.com/news/all-new-nissan-patrol-armada-drags-refreshed-lexus-lx-one-behemoth-is-just-inches-ahead-251308.html,Technology
Huawei’s first HarmonyOS laptop marks a bold break from Android compatibility,"Huawei HarmonyOS laptop represents radical departure from Android.

Unnamed device showcases China’s growing tech independence, with 2,000 apps by year-end.

Windows licence expiry forced transition.

Chinese tech giant Huawei has unveiled its first Huawei HarmonyOS laptop. It appears less like a triumphant debut and more like a calculated necessity born from expired licensing agreements and geopolitical tensions.

Speaking at a closed-door event in Shenzhen – the bustling high-tech hub where Huawei’s headquarters oversee its global operations – Zhu Dongdong, the company president of tablets and PCs, presented what may be the most significant software departure in the company’s recent history.

The laptop, still without an official name, runs HarmonyOS 5 (also known as HarmonyOS Next), marking the first iteration of Huawei’s operating system to completely abandon Android compatibility.

The timing isn’t coincidental. Huawei’s Microsoft Windows licence for personal computers expired in March, effectively forcing the company’s hand in an industry already navigating complex international relationships.

While some Huawei laptops have previously offered Linux options, the majority of the company’s portable computers have relied on Windows, making the recent transition a significant shift.

The laptop showcases ambitious artificial intelligence integration through Celia, the company’s digital assistant. According to state-backed newspaper Securities Times, Celia can create presentation slides, summarise meeting minutes, and retrieve information from local documents – capabilities that depend heavily on third-party software availability.

The dependency highlights the potential, and limitations, of Huawei’s independent ecosystem approach. Software compatibility remains a crucial battleground for the Huawei HarmonyOS laptop initiative.

The device supports Chinese alternatives to Western applications, including WPS (China’s Microsoft Office equivalent) and Alibaba Group’s enterprise collaboration platform DingTalk.

Perhaps more intriguingly, the laptop bridges mobile and desktop computing by supporting mobile applications like RedNote, Bilibili, and ByteDance’s Feishu, creating a hybrid ecosystem that traditional PC manufacturers haven’t fully explored.

The interface design reflects the mobile-desktop convergence. Users encounter a smartphone-inspired home screen displaying apps as icons, cards, or folders, while a macOS-style dock anchors the bottom of the screen. The design philosophy suggests Huawei is betting on familiarity rather than revolutionary interface concepts.

Industry observers note that Huawei’s HarmonyOS journey began in 2015, well before current geopolitical tensions reached their peak. The company’s commitment to this long-term strategy became apparent with last year’s Mate 70 series smartphones, which marked HarmonyOS’s complete break from Android compatibility.

The March introduction of the foldable Pura X reinforced the trajectory. The broader HarmonyOS ecosystem now covers over 160 Huawei devices, including smartphones, tablets, televisions, and wearables.

The extensive compatibility network provides a foundation for the laptop’s introduction, though questions remain about consumer adoption and enterprise acceptance beyond China’s borders.

Market data from Counterpoint Research reveals HarmonyOS’s growing influence in China, achieving a 19% market share in Q4 2024. Its performance outpaced Apple’s iOS (17% market share) for four consecutive quarters, though Android maintained dominance with 64% market share.

The figures suggest Huawei’s ecosystem strategy is gaining traction domestically, but breaking into global markets presents additional challenges.

The laptop’s planned May 19 official launch represents more than a product announcement – it symbolises China’s determination to develop independent technology solutions amid ongoing trade restrictions. Zhu’s declaration that Huawei had “fully entered the era of HarmonyOS” for terminal devices underscores this strategic pivot.

Technical specifications remain limited, but Huawei promises over 2,000 supported applications by year-end, according to state-backed newspaper Nanfang Daily. The ambitious target reflects both the ecosystem’s rapid development and the challenges of building a competitive software library from scratch.

The implications extend beyond Huawei’s corporate strategy. As Chinese tech companies develop independent solutions, global technology markets may fragment into distinct ecosystems, potentially reshaping how consumers and enterprises approach device selection and software compatibility.

For Huawei, the HarmonyOS laptop represents opportunity and risk in equal measure. Success could validate the company’s substantial investment in independent operating system development, while failure might highlight the difficulties of competing with established platforms like Windows and macOS.

As the official launch approaches, industry watchers will scrutinise not just technical capabilities, but also pricing, availability, and enterprise adoption potential. The unnamed Huawei HarmonyOS laptop may ultimately be remembered as either a bold innovation or a cautionary tale about the complexities of building independent technology ecosystems.

Whether this laptop succeeds or struggles, its introduction marks a definitive moment in the ongoing evolution of global technology markets, where political pressures and business necessities drive innovation and decisions.",https://techwireasia.com/2025/05/huaweis-first-harmonyos-laptop-marks-a-bold-break-from-android-compatibility/,Technology
Huawei schedules nova 14 series launch event,"Huawei is set to announce its nova 14 series on May 19 at 2:30 PM Beijing time. The upcoming midrange phones will consist of at least three devices with a nova 14, nova 14 Pro and an Ultra model joining the ranks.

Samsung announces limited edition two-tone Titanium Black Galaxy Ring,"The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge was announced earlier today (you can find a price breakdown here). But this isn’t the only announcement from today – tucked in at the bottom of the Korean press release is a note that Samsung is launching a limited edition Galaxy Ring in a two-tone titanium black color.

This will be sold alongside the Galaxy S25 Edge at the Samsung Gangnam flagship store starting tomorrow. To be clear, you can buy the ring on its own, but if you get the S25 Edge + two-tone Ring combo, you will score a 20% discount on the ring itself and KRW 100,000 in Samsung Electronics membership points.



Samsung Galaxy Ring in Titanium Silver and Titanium Black

You want to hear something funny? Samsung announced the new colorway for the Galaxy Ring but didn’t provide any images of it – none, nada, not a single one. So, here is the Ring in Titanium Silver and Titanium Black above, the two-tone version should be a mix of those two.

This might have been your only chance to see the two-tone version – the press releases for other countries make no mention of this new version and it’s not clear how many rings have been made either.

Despite some reports that the Galaxy Ring 2 will launch early, there is no official news on that yet – but we’ll keep our eyes open during the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7 launch.

Google’s bringing Gemini to your car with Android Auto,"Google is bringing Gemini, its generative AI, to all cars that support Android Auto in the next few months, the company announced at its Android Show ahead of the company’s 2025 I/O developer conference.

The company says adding Gemini functionality to Android Auto and, later this year, to cars that run Google’s built-in operating system, will make driving “more productive — and fun” in the blog post.

“This is really going to be, we think, one of the largest transformations in the in-vehicle experience that we’ve seen in a very, very long time,” Patrick Brady, the VP of Android for Cars, said during a virtual briefing with members of the media ahead of the conference.

Gemini will surface in the Android Auto experience in two main ways.

Gemini will act as a much more powerful smart voice assistant. Drivers (or passengers — Brady said they are not voice-matching to whoever owns the phone running the Android Auto experience) will be able to ask Gemini to send texts, play music, and basically do all the things Google Assistant was already able to do. The difference is users won’t have to be so robotic with their commands thanks to the natural language capabilities of Gemini.

Gemini can also “remember” things like whether a contact prefers receiving text messages in a particular language, and handle that translation for the user. And Google claims Gemini will be capable of doing one of the most commonly paraded in-car tech demos: finding good restaurants along a planned route. Of course, Brady said Gemini will be able to mine Google listings and reviews to respond to more specific requests (like “taco places with vegan options”).

The other main way Gemini will surface is with what Google is calling “Gemini Live,” which is an option where the digital AI is essentially always listening and ready to engage in full conversations about … whatever. Brady said those conversations could be about everything from travel ideas for spring break, to brainstorming recipes a 10-year-old would like, to “Roman history.”

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW

If that all sounds a bit distracting, Brady said Google believes it won’t be. He claimed the natural language capabilities will make it easier to ask Android Auto to do specific tasks with less fuss, and therefore Gemini will “reduce cognitive load.”

It’s a bold claim to make at a time when people are clamoring for car companies to move away from touchscreens and bring back physical knobs and buttons — a request many of those companies are starting to oblige.

There’s a lot still being sorted out. For now, Gemini will leverage Google’s cloud processing to operate in both Android Auto and on cars with Google Built-In. But Brady said Google is working with automakers “to build in more compute so that [Gemnini] can run at the edge,” which would help not only with performance but with reliability — a challenging factor in a moving vehicle that may be latching onto new cell towers every few minutes.

Modern cars also generate a lot of data from onboard sensors, and on some models, even interior and exterior cameras. Brady said Google has “nothing to announce” about whether Gemini could leverage that multi-modal data, and that “we’ve been talking about that a lot.”

“We definitely think as cars have more and more cameras, there’s some really, really interesting use cases in the future here,” he said.

Gemini on Android Auto and Google Built-In will be coming to all countries that already have access to the company’s generative AI model, and will support more than 40 languages.

Game publishers rush to fill fall 2025 gap left by GTA VI delay,"Following the announcement that Grand Theft Auto (GTA) VI will launch in May 2026, video game publishers are seizing the opportunity to schedule major releases for fall 2025, traditionally one of the most profitable seasons for the gaming industry.

The delay of the highly anticipated Rockstar Games title has opened up a coveted window for competing publishers to avoid going head-to-head with what is expected to be one of the biggest game launches of the decade. Major companies are now positioning their titles to capitalize on the absence of GTA VI from this year’s release calendar.

Electronic Arts was among the first to react, confirming that its next Battlefield installment will be released within the current fiscal year ending in March 2026. The announcement came just days after the GTA delay, signalling a strategic move to lock in a more favourable release period.

Meanwhile, Take-Two is also expected to push forward with another of its high-profile titles, Mafia: The Old Country, during the same timeframe.

Several other anticipated games, including Dying Light: The Beast and Killing Floor 3, could also benefit from the reshuffling, with fall 2025 now offering a rare window of opportunity.

The stretch from September through early December is traditionally seen as a golden quarter for the industry, bolstered by public holidays and holiday shopping. However, the long development cycles typical of blockbuster games make last-minute adjustments difficult.

As a result, this period may instead see a wave of expansion packs, remastered editions, and releases from smaller studios with games nearing completion.

For established franchises and publishers, the GTA delay could be a significant advantage. Titles like Battlefield, as well as EA’s annual FC and Madden NFL releases, now face fewer obstacles in capturing players’ attention—and wallets.

Still, the flood of new titles vying for attention in the fall could create its own challenges. With many consumers increasingly cautious about spending and competition likely to be fierce, not every release is guaranteed to benefit.

The delay has also raised broader questions about the industry’s growth trajectory heading into 2025. GTA VI was expected to generate billions in sales and stimulate console purchases.

Its absence, combined with rising console prices linked to global tariffs, could weigh on overall hardware sales.

Despite these concerns, the gaming industry has shown signs of resilience. Recent strong forecasts from key players suggest that while GTA VI may be absent, other titles could still drive momentum and help offset any slowdown.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/05/13/game-publishers-rush-to-fill-fall-2025-gap-left-by-gta-vi-delay/,Technology
Google unveils first major update to ‘G’ icon in a decade,"The logo of Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 17, 2021. PHOTO:REUTERS

Listen to article

Google has begun rolling out the first major redesign of its iconic ‘G’ icon in nearly a decade, ahead of its annual I/O 2025 developer conference scheduled for May 20.

The updated logo features a smooth gradient transition between Google’s four signature colours — red, yellow, green, and blue — replacing the previous design with solid colour blocks.

This refreshed 'G' icon, now live in the latest Google Search app update (version 16.18 beta) on Android and iOS, is part of a broader visual update inspired by the brand's AI-driven direction, including Gemini and other Google AI features.

The new gradient design is intended to evoke a more dynamic and modern aesthetic, aligning with Google's evolving product ecosystem.

The design shift marks the first major change to the ‘G’ symbol since September 2015, when Google introduced its Product Sans typeface and transitioned from the old lowercase 'g' on a blue background to the multicoloured capital ‘G’.

The company has yet to confirm whether other Google product logos, such as Chrome or Maps, will adopt similar gradient styles.

As of now, the redesigned icon appears only in the Google Search app and as a homescreen logo on mobile devices. It remains unclear if the primary six-letter “Google” wordmark or other visual elements will be updated as well.

This branding refresh comes as Google seeks to unify its visual identity across platforms amid a growing focus on generative AI and cross-device experiences.",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2545553/google-unveils-first-major-update-to-g-icon-in-a-decade,Technology

One of the biggest new features in Samsung's One UI 7 based on Android 15 is the Now Bar with the Now Brief, and in the upcoming One UI 8 based on Android 16 this may be getting a very interesting upgrade.

According to a teardown of the One UI 8 firmware, you'll be able to listen to your Now Brief too, not just read it. This will be called Listen Brief, naturally.



Listen Brief code snippets in One UI 8

Now Brief offers a summary of your morning, afternoon, and evening, including weather, calendar events, traffic updates, and news. And with Listen Brief, you'll get all that in audio form.

You'll be able to choose between Samsung's and Google's text-to-speech engines, as well as pause, play again, and stop the briefing audio whenever you want.

Of course, Now Brief is still missing a ton of possibly useful stuff like sports scores, email integration, package tracking, and many more, and we do hope all of those get added at some later point.

Apple releases iOS 18.5 with support for carrier-provided satellite features,"Today, Apple has released iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5, the fifth update to iOS 18 / iPadOS 18 which first came out in September. Despite what the .5 increment might have you believe, this is definitely not a major update.

In fact, there's barely anything new. The main thing is that iOS now supports carrier-provided satellite features. You also get a new Pride Harmony wallpaper, and parents will receive a notification when the Screen Time passcode is used on a child's device.

There's now Buy with iPhone compatibility for purchasing content within the Apple TV app or a third party device, and an issue where the Apple Vision Pro app displayed a black screen has been fixed. That's it.

Of course, there are also a bunch of security fixes, all detailed over here. If only for those, you should update as soon as possible. As with all iOS and iPadOS updates, you should have already received a notification about the availability of 18.5.

vivo S30 and S30 Pro mini specs leak,"According to a new leak out of China, vivo is working on the S30, which will be powered by Qualcomm's still-unannounced Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 SoC. That's one generation newer than the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 in its predecessor.

The phone will allegedly have a 6.67-inch ""1.5K"" resolution flat screen, a periscope telephoto camera using Sony's IMX882 sensor, and a 6,500 mAh battery.

It will be joined by the S30 Pro mini, with a 6.31-inch ""1.5K"" flat screen (in fact rumored to be exactly the same LTPO OLED panel used in the X200 Pro mini), and this one will be powered by either the Dimensity 9300+ or the Dimensity 9400e that's popping up quite a lot in rumors lately. The smaller device will apparently have a metal frame, and the same periscope telephoto camera and battery capacity as its larger sibling.

The Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 is expected to be made using TSMC's N4 process, and it will have a 1+3+4 CPU core design for a ""low-power mid-range chip"", machine translation from Chinese says.

"Sony Xperia 1 VII brings Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, larger sensor for ultrawide camera","The Sony Xperia 1 VII is here, and it looks very much like its predecessor. It comes in two new colors, so it's easier to tell apart though - Moss Green and Orchid Purple.

Sony kept the blueprint unchanged - the Xperia 1 VII has the same 6.5-inch display diagonal, the same 5,000mAh battery, and a triple camera system on the back, but it's still bringing key improvements.

The main shooter and the continuous optical zoom are the same as before - you get a 24mm f/1.9 wide angle camera with a 1/1.35-inch Exmor T sensor, OIS, and PDAF. The telephoto has an 85mm-170mm f/2.3-f3.5 lens with a smallish 1/3.5-inch Exmor RS imager. The zoom still has telemacro abilities - you get a 4cm minimum focusing distance at 120mm.

What's new this year is the ultrawide camera - it's still a 16mm lens but with a brighter f/2.0 aperture (vs f/2.2) and a 1/1.56-inch Exmor RS sensor - 2.1x larger than the previous one.

The camera system has a healthy helping of AI-infused Alpha smarts - Sony's real-time eye AF is there for both humans and animals, there's AI main subject recognition, AI white balance, AI exposure, and AI depth. There's also Ultra HDR support, so your images will pop on any supported HDR screen. Sony has also kept the physical two-stage camera button, but it's ever-so-slightly wider and more comfortable this year.



A new, bigger ultrawide angle sensor

While on the topic of what's kept this year, the Xperia 1 VII has a 3.5mm audio jack. It now uses a higher-quality solder with added gold, which thoroughly minimizes transmission loss. Inside, the phone has a premium-grade Audio Integrated Circuit, as before.

There's also a built-in microSD card slot, meaning you can greatly expand the phone's 256GB built-in storage.

The phone is IP68 water and dust tight, and has Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and GG Victus on the back.

The Xperia 1 VII has the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC with a vapor chamber to help keep it cool. It's paired to 12GB of RAM. There's also Wi-Fi 7 and twice the Bluetooth transmission throughput of the Xperia 1 VI.

The display is a 10-bit 6.5-inch 1080x2340px Bravia 120Hz OLED panel - nearly identical to the panel on the previous Xperia 1, though this one is 20% brighter.

Sony has integrated two illuminance sensors (one on the front, one on the back), which help with precise brightness adjustment. There's also automatic color adjustment in different lighting, increasing both the brightness and the saturation in strong light.

The front-facing full-stage stereo speakers have 10% richer bass and mid-bass and were tuned in collaboration with Sony Music Entertainment.

The Xperia 1 VII has retained the 5,000mAh battery with 30W charging, neither of which is exactly groundbreaking these days. However, Sony says you can expect 2 full days of endurance, including 36 hours of continuous video playback from the power pack.

Sony has a set of battery-safety features - Xperia Adaptive Charging and Battery Care - that ensure you get 4 years of battery health. Sony says its battery will lose less than 20% of its capacity after 48 months of use.

Finally, the Xperia 1 VII ships with Android 15 out of the box and Sony pledges at least 4 OS version updates, and 6 years of security fixes.

The Sony Xperia 1 VII comes in three colors - Slate Black, Moss Green, and Orchid Purple - and in a single 12/256GB configuration (there will be a 512GB model for Asia). It is available for order in Europe and the UK, and it will start shipping in June. Price is set at £1,399/€1,499.",https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_1_vii_brings_snapdragon_8_elite_chip_bigsensor_16mm_ultrawide-news-67734.php,Technology
Moon missions: How to avoid a puncture on the Moon,"How to avoid a puncture on the Moon

2 days ago Share Save Padraig Belton Technology Reporter Share Save

Getty Images The Apollo mission lunar rovers were lightweight vehicles

Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel. After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat. ""One thing you cannot have is a puncture,"" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin. The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover. Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears. As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027. Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030. The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface. ""The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,"" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand. ""We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,"" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.

NASA The rocky surface on Mars has damaged Curiosity's tyres

One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges. At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving. And that's a problem for tyres. ""Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,"" says Dr Padula. The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape. ""If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,"" says Dr Padula. The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in. The next space missions will need to drive round ""bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger"", he says. And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.

Padraig Belton Michelin uses high-performance plastics for its Moon tyres

Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles. Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres. ""In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,"" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028. One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium. ""Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company. He calls nitinol's flexible properties ""one of the craziest things you will ever see"". Nitinol is a potentially ""revolutionary"" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says. However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.

Bridgestone The pads on the Bridgestone tyre mimic camel hooves

Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels. Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil. Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex. The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface. Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May). Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them. Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface. Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes. ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrve1zrlg3o,Technology
